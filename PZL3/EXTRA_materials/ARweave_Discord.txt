Blockchain is changing the data storage landscape
Many people have heard of Blockchain but most think of only cryptocurrency. This piece by Mark Patrick shows how Blockchain can be executed in an array of different ways.

[06-Feb-19 06:18 PM] DesignBlock#0184
My idea is a Live Video recording / streaming mobile app / dapp where video from is uploaded right away on the weave, this is to assure that the FOOTAGE IS REAL and not edited. Because many videos today can be edited including the spoken word on sopaker and how he move her mouth (yeah lot of fake news/history).


[06-Feb-19 06:20 PM] DesignBlock#0184
Even good if it will be incorporated with blockchain based time/location tracking like XYO network (because GPS can be faked) to certify the time and location where the footage was taken.

@DesignBlock great idea, thanks for sharing, we appreciate your support   


[07-Feb-19 04:30 AM] arweave-stan#3973
The problem is always of trust in the application itself.


[07-Feb-19 04:31 AM] arweave-stan#3973
But if you can assume that the application running on the machine is truly unmodified, then the proposed system would give a very nice way of saying 'this is what happened at this location, at this time'.


[07-Feb-19 04:32 AM] arweave-stan#3973
Our team will have a think about any ways to avoid tampering with the application itself in order to increase trust in the uploaded data.


[07-Feb-19 07:43 AM] tiamat#9131
@DesignBlock you could store a hash of the video so in case video gets modified, you will know, but of course you won't know the original version, still you will save a lot of AR


[08-Feb-19 12:09 AM] DesignBlock#0184
@arweave-stan i think DApps (blockchain) can prevent that from happenning


[08-Feb-19 12:10 AM] DesignBlock#0184
@tiamat yes that will be a lot, unless the ap cmpress the video file first before uploading


[08-Feb-19 12:11 AM] DesignBlock#0184
If that is still a lot of storage, let's try a camera photo uploading on  the weave first


[08-Feb-19 12:11 AM] DesignBlock#0184
So only real photos are there, no filters, edits..


[08-Feb-19 01:46 AM] arweave-stan#3973
Yh, I think Dapps could prevent that too, the team will think out a way to prevent it @DesignBlock

[24-Apr-19 05:08 AM] DesignBlock#0184
Im trying to create a Google Drive to Arweave uploader, what happens is Zapier gets the file first and upload it to its own domain before relaying it to Arweave, so when Arweave get the data, just the link to the file(from Zapier's domain, not google drive) and not the file itself was uploaded. Zapier was able to get the file (not just the link) from Google, I think we can work on Zapier integration to solve this.

Perhaps the need for the channel can come when liquidity does come at "some point". The channel doesn't seem to serve any use at this point.

Liquidity and value of AR from ICO will be considerably affected by the dilution of mined AR. Each passing day means more mined AR diluting the existing illiquid AR from ICO to now. But nothing is been said about that. That directly shows disregard of the investors who contributed in the ICO to fund Arweave.

@st$egg the team has never disregarded the investors, please you should understand that it's in the hands of exchange to decide when to list a project and not the other way around. Also please do understand that there are some processes undergone, before listing a project and the team are handling all these. We will release news about exchange when we can.  Thanks for your support

That's bullshit.  Don't put it on the exchanges.  No exchange takes 8 months to list an asset, full stop.  I also know for a fact AR could have been listed on a couple of exchanges (tier 1 & 2) for free at any point in time since your mainnet if you guys wanted it.  Heck, I can get you guys listed right now on those same exchanges just DM me.  You wont.

This is getting old really fast, how can anyone have a real conversation about liquidity when you guys are hiding your real motivations for shutting out liquidity.  Why are you guys doing it, to punish investors for anoying you with all the "when exchange" talk?  We need to have a real conversation about this.

[28-Jan-19 05:37 PM] DaVinci#0538
There was talk that they cannot afford, or simply do not want to spend money on market makers, and most exchanges will not list you without them


[28-Jan-19 05:40 PM] Mason Black#0187
That sounds like a more plausable explanation.  Would explain why they stopped talking to the exchanges and went the OTC desk route.  This is the reason why the SEC is coming after all these companies, the negligence displayed toward protecting investors' interests is off the charts.


[28-Jan-19 06:42 PM] Mason Black#0187
Had the team been forthright and told investors up-front they weren't planning on providing liquidity the demand would have vanished and they wouldn't have even reached even their softcap.   This is called a bait-and-switch.


[28-Jan-19 08:56 PM] DaVinci#0538
Indeed it is


[28-Jan-19 09:50 PM] st$egg#8289
Again, nothing said about the massive dilution going on with every mined AR getting into circulation. Zero consideration for investors' interests.

Also, the whole 8-month old "its in the hands of exchanges to list a project" is not making any sense anymore, I'm sure everyone knows that. That can stop, use something else, frankly. What happens when the remaining miners decide to turn off their machines because of uncertainty with liquidity? what happens when they realize mining AR is not going to pay for equipment anytime soon? There is a huge disconnect from reality in all non technical parts of Arweave.


[28-Jan-19 11:50 PM] Mason Black#0187
Its not even about not affording it, they can afford it.  The listings are free, e.g. bittrex.  All they would have needed to do is provide a certain amount of AR to fill orderbooks.  Look at Haven Protocol (XHV) a microcap a fraction of the size of Arweave getting listed immediatelly without issue.  Something else is going on here, these guys are not being honest with their community.  Hiding behind the "exchanges decide" narrative is not cutting it anymore.


[29-Jan-19 12:46 AM] Mason Black#0187
@arweave-stan Go back to Sam and ask him for a new narrative, this one ain't working nomore.


[29-Jan-19 12:50 AM] Mason Black#0187
A project still in dev not providing liquidity its one thing, but one post-mainnet which is giving out mining rewards in an illiquid token being diluted daily that was sold to investors to raise capital is outright criminal.


[29-Jan-19 01:54 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Mason Black please my answer to you is not a bullshit and be polite with words. What I gave to you is the available update, when we have any new updates, we will share with our investors.  And please we're not in anyway, punishing the investors. Thanks


[29-Jan-19 01:59 AM] arweave-stan#3973
#Warning @st$egg please keep here Liquidity related discussion, discussion about mining or random comment can be made on #mining-economics and #random channels respectively. Thanks for your understanding

@DaVinci please do not spread false information.


[29-Jan-19 12:21 PM] st$egg#8289
@arweave-stan The illiquidity and continued dilution of circulating AR from ICO to now is not random. Your response again does not address any point mentioned.


[29-Jan-19 12:41 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@st$egg there's no new update regarding the exchange, so don't expect different answer, when we have new update, we will announce it. Thanks


[31-Jan-19 09:51 AM] rehash#3438
@st$egg every single project is REKT, just forget about your investment... at least for a couple of months


[31-Jan-19 09:52 AM] rehash#3438
a listing won't get your money back during this market, it will only confirm your loss if that is what you need


[31-Jan-19 11:24 AM] st$egg#8289
@rehash You proly don't fully get the point. Its not about ROI.


[31-Jan-19 12:17 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I think its more about investors going into something that they didnt realize had a lockup for an indeterminate amount of time.  I know I for one have never invested in an ICO if i knew there was a 6 month lockup or whatever


[31-Jan-19 12:18 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I would like to think the community would be less angry if it was just known up front that there was a lockup period after mainnet or something.


[31-Jan-19 12:18 PM] Vilenarios#8742
But cant go back in time, it is what it is at this point.


[31-Jan-19 12:22 PM] Vilenarios#8742
But there are OTC markets i think so if someone really needs to let go of tokens for tax reasons, apartment rent or whatever they may want, then its still possible.  Just waaay not as conveinant as "sell button" on an exchange

Developers can get some free airdropped AR, so they can get started.  I know that was also a concern around lack of exchange provided liquidity.


[31-Jan-19 01:18 PM] chriscord#4741
How does one become a developer? I have some elixir skills. Erlang not so much but I can stretch my legs  


[31-Jan-19 02:15 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@chriscord sorry, but this channel is for liquidity related discussion, you can use #random to ask your questions, if you didn't see the channel suitable for your question. 

If I get you correctly, do you mean how can one develop on Arweave network?


[31-Jan-19 02:16 PM] arweave-stan#3973
Or are you asking being a developer generally? If so, I'm sorry, I'm unable to help.


[31-Jan-19 02:17 PM] arweave-stan#3973
But if regarding Arweave, I'll provide you with necessary information.


[02-Feb-19 01:05 AM] Ben#7669
This channel is an oxymoron, there is no liquidity on Arweave.


[02-Feb-19 02:07 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Ben there's no exchange currently, but exchange will come at some point. Also the channel still serve some purpose as some people who have been away for long, might like to ask about exchange, so it doesn't hurt having it now.


[02-Feb-19 10:00 AM] Ben#7669
@arweave-stan exchange will come at some point? When? This team has been yanking our chain with this BS for months.


[02-Feb-19 10:56 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Ben please we don't talk bullshit, we have explained about exchange listing and do not expect us to break any NDA, just to share how far we have gone with exchange. The team are working on exchange and that's all we can share now, we will release the news when we can.

@nio68 You can use base58 but the minimum is $10,000. Thanks


[03-Feb-19 03:21 AM] nio68#2750
Projects like this make me yearn eagerly for regulations in this space. Some assess need to be straightened


[03-Feb-19 05:45 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@nio68 please keep here Liquidity related discussion, for any comment you cannot see the suitable channel, please use the #random channel. Thanks


[03-Feb-19 02:10 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan This is certainly interesting, but who is the guarantor in this case (base58 OTC group or what)? This is a not small amount.... Can you elaborate on this?


[03-Feb-19 05:57 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@slayer_hellraiser please if you need any further details about the OTC desk, kindly drop us an email on team@arweave.org. thanks for your understanding :)


[04-Feb-19 06:19 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan Done. Waiting for your answer


[04-Feb-19 06:43 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@slayer_hellraiser ok, my colleague will get back to you. Thanks


[04-Feb-19 10:43 AM] ivhturp#3325
Hi @arweave-stan , if this channel is for liquidity,  it would in best interests of community to elaborate OTC desk details in this channel itself. I dont see any purpose of this channel if email communication is required


[04-Feb-19 10:47 AM] ivhturp#3325
Dont you think everyone will be asking similar questions and you will be wasting your time with it? My 2 questions:
1. What is OTC price offered?
2. Is team arweave guarantor for these txns as Base58 is recommended by you.

{Reactions}
  

[04-Feb-19 10:53 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@ivhturp  I'm sorry, it's left for the OTC desk to provide with you the information you mentioned, I'm unable to comment further regarding the OTC desk, so for your best interest, I'd recommend you to drop us an email. Thanks for your understanding


[04-Feb-19 10:55 AM] ivhturp#3325
Even 2nd question?


[04-Feb-19 10:56 AM] ivhturp#3325
Can we plz delete this channel


[04-Feb-19 10:56 AM] ivhturp#3325
If we have emails for this purpose, i find this channel useless


[04-Feb-19 10:57 AM] ivhturp#3325
Can you also elaborate *best interest*


[04-Feb-19 11:13 AM] arweave-stan#3973
I'm sorry, the channel is not useless, many people's questions have been answered here, and deleting the channel will prevent people who have been away for long time, from asking about liquidity.


[04-Feb-19 11:20 AM] arweave-stan#3973
By your best interest, I mean as you're interested in having more details about the OTC, you should drop us an email, while my colleague will do well to get back to your questions.


[04-Feb-19 11:29 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan , I think that @ivhturp means that not only he will be interested in hearing the answer to his question.


[04-Feb-19 12:36 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I would suggest just posting what the team emails you with. Seems totally insane to have to do that...


[04-Feb-19 12:38 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@Vilenarios Will they ban us for this?


[04-Feb-19 12:41 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Uhh i dont know.  That would be sad if that was the case...


[04-Feb-19 12:55 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Obviously not recommending people to do stuff the team doesnt want - but it seems completely counter productive to have a channel like this and then only have private communications about liquidity.


[04-Feb-19 01:32 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@slayer_hellraiser no one is banning you if you abide by the rules of the channel, which are discussing related topics on the channel, not spamming the channel with the same question after you have been answered to or told what to do, also not using any inappropriate words. If you keep to this, you will be fine :)


[04-Feb-19 01:41 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan It is not clear to us whether the OTC topic is not a taboo subject in principle or not. For all questions with regards to this, you ask to write to e-mail. There would be no recurring questions from different people if they saw the answer here or in the telegram. One little secret: it will save you and your team time for answers in the future. Do not you think so?


[04-Feb-19 01:56 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@slayer_hellraiser#5093 yh, I understand you, but I've provided the name of the OTC desk, any other further help or information, email can be sent to us, while my colleague follow it up, besides, we sent email about the OTC desk to our investors. So those who invested must have the details.


[04-Feb-19 02:06 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan otc.arweave.org? I find this e-mail


[04-Feb-19 02:44 PM] ivhturp#3325
@arweave-stan Can you not even answer question 'Is team arweave guarantor for OTC desk transactions of Base58' here ? Do we need to send an email to know the response for this?


[04-Feb-19 02:51 PM] ivhturp#3325
And @arweave-stan , could you atleast let us know how many transactions were successfully carried out via this Base58 desk. Last time i checked, no one got response from them.


[04-Feb-19 03:55 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@slayer_hellraiser yh, that's correct.


[04-Feb-19 03:57 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@ivhturp like I said before, base58 is the OTC desk. Regarding the transactions, I'm unable to give the details, please is left for base58 to provide you with the details. Thanks for your understanding.

[12-Feb-19 10:55 PM] Beamer J#4218
@arweave-stan what are you talking about. Look grin and beam already listed on couple of exchanges regardless of having their own blockchain coin. Stop this BS.


[12-Feb-19 11:50 PM] st$egg#8289
It seems like a deliberate decision to ignore the massive dilution of AR bought from ICO by AR that is mined daily. The level of disregard for ICO investors here is unimaginable. Its almost 9 months of excuses with native tokens and NDA when reality does not seem to support the endless excuses about liquidity.


[13-Feb-19 12:38 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Beamer J please Arweave never lied to you and be mindful of your words, if you really purchased Arweave token, there was no ETA on exchange listing on the document you were sent to. I'll advise you to pay more attention on the development of the project and the project is very active, we have explained countless times how exchange listing works, also Sam has come here to share more details.


[13-Feb-19 01:07 AM] Beamer J#4218
@st$egg My investment worth nothing now. Projects like arweave made ico look bad. People lost faith. They think we can not do any harm or damege to arweave team. I dont know what to do now. They are spending our money who knows for what. I want my money back!


[13-Feb-19 01:09 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan I talked to base58, even signed the documents and sent them the ID and the Proof of Residence, they answered me a week later and said that they did not work with users from Russia. What to do, friend?


[13-Feb-19 01:09 AM] Beamer J#4218
SEC is coming even after ICO promoters. I hope they will start investigation in arweave. Where is our money spent...


[13-Feb-19 01:27 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@slayer_hellraiser I'm sorry as they don't accept users from Russia, even some exchanges also restrict citizens from a particular country, so I'll advise you to be patient till we go on exchange and I hope we'll be on exchange where your country is not restricted also.


[13-Feb-19 01:38 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Beamer J #warning, please do not spam the channel with the same comment, like I've explained to you, there was no ETA on exchange listing, the development of the project is very active,  there's a constant communication between the team and the community members. We release updates always. Thanks


[17-Feb-19 05:56 AM] iLion#6786
Hi, can you please elaborate for what liquidity related question I actually CAN get an answer here?

1) OTC current price?
2) When trading enabled ie. Exchange will be available, any plan/estimate timewise yet within team (not needing any information on what exchange name, so don't give me the NDA crap -please)?
3) Will there be MM activities to ensure liquidity on first exchange listing?
4) Are the some other plans (than maybe MM) to promote liquidity of Arweave token?
5) What amount of tokens have been set aside by the team to ensure liquidity on the markets (if ANY?)
6) Any OTC volumes to share, in order to provide some numbers on current liquidity in OTC markets?


[17-Feb-19 07:24 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@iLion Please regarding your questions. 

1. I don't know the current price of the OTC, base58 are in a better position to answer the question. 
2. No ETA for exchange listing, stay tuned.
3. Please I'm sorry, I've no idea about MM.
4. I believe before exchange listing, there will be some sort of PR and marketing.
5. I've no idea about that, there will be approximately 23m total amount of tokens in circulation during listing.
6. Base58 can help with that, please for further information, do drop us an email to team@arweave.org


[17-Feb-19 09:45 AM] ivhturp#3325
@arweave-stan I was in touch with Base58. These guys never replied after I asked for the last OTC price or  volumes. As far as I understood, there were 0 trades on Base58.


[17-Feb-19 11:21 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@ivhturp I'm sorry about that, you can resend them email as a reminder. Thanks for your understanding

Arweave should check what happened to Atonomi. People started collecting money for a hitman. So be careful arweave. Public isn't stupid as you think

  😲 

[21-Feb-19 08:30 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan Base58 just ignoring my e-mails. I send it tons of e-mails..


[21-Feb-19 08:33 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Beamer J there's a two different cases between Arweave and atonomi, and they are incomparable. Arweave project Development has been ongoing and there's constant communication and updates by the team, besides, Arweave team didn't give any ETA for exchange listing to the token purchasers, but in the case of atonomi, since June last year, there hasn't been any updates on the project, and last communication from the team was around November/December. 

Like we have said, we'll release news about exchange when we can and please let's keep it Arweave related discussion. Thanks for your understanding.


[21-Feb-19 08:34 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan Is Atonomi development suspended? You are confusing something.


[21-Feb-19 08:36 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@slayer_hellraiser please like I said, let's keep it Arweave related discussion. For details about Atonomi, you can check their group. Thanks


[21-Feb-19 08:39 AM] rehash#3438
@Beamer J let me guess, after being scammed by Atonomi, those people are going to get scammed by a hitman?


[21-Feb-19 08:40 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan @Beamer J  are very subtly hinted for you that your company is similar to Atonomi, "nothing personal, just business??"


[21-Feb-19 08:49 AM] arweave-stan#3973
Guys please let's keep it Arweave related discussion. Any project you want to get information about them, you can join their group, and ask your questions or discuss about the project. 

Arweave is upto date with development, and there's constant communication from the team. We're always here to reply to anyone who has any questions or issues about Arweave. Thanks for your understanding and supports.


[21-Feb-19 10:00 PM] Beamer J#4218
@rehash have you at least heard abt black market?


[21-Feb-19 11:31 PM] rehash#3438
@Beamer J I hope they make a complain to the authorities because of your hitman threats. It shouldn't be hard to track you down.


[21-Feb-19 11:31 PM] rehash#3438
also you should get a ban

[25-Feb-19 05:31 AM] bettercallsaul#8215
I've been keeping up on Arweave since their first initial pre-sale...and most recently reading this #liquidity channel. Alot of negative here, although I do agree with 'some' of the statements.


[25-Feb-19 05:32 AM] bettercallsaul#8215
I recently emailed Base58 about the OTC trading and they replied within 1 business day.


[25-Feb-19 05:33 AM] bettercallsaul#8215
I did follow all of their instructions for their on-boarding process and, unfortunately, the only answer I received was they do not work with individuals/companies in the U.S..


[25-Feb-19 05:34 AM] bettercallsaul#8215
So my arweave tokens are illiquid at this time.


[25-Feb-19 05:34 AM] bettercallsaul#8215
I emailed a follow-up question to them to kindly at least share with me the current OTC trading value. I'll post any reply I receive from them


[25-Feb-19 05:35 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@bettercallsaul I'm sorry about that,  you should understand about the regulations regarding digital currencies in some regions/countries


[25-Feb-19 05:35 AM] bettercallsaul#8215
I already figured they would reply  that way though


[25-Feb-19 05:35 AM] digamma889#3785
That's unfortunate to hear Saul


[25-Feb-19 05:35 AM] arweave-stan#3973
They have to abide by the rules and regulations.


[25-Feb-19 05:35 AM] bettercallsaul#8215
I read everything regarding the pre-sale so I knew this was a risk until it is on an exchange


[25-Feb-19 05:36 AM] digamma889#3785
i'm interested un the current otc value as well. sharing is much appreciated


[25-Feb-19 05:38 AM] arweave-stan#3973
Yh,  glad you understand and knows the risk involved   @bettercallsaul


[25-Feb-19 05:38 AM] arweave-stan#3973
Please I advise you to be patient till we go on exchange. Thanks for your support


[25-Feb-19 05:38 AM] bettercallsaul#8215
I'm interested too. I don't necessarily want to sell my tokens...I'd like a clearer approach/ability to at least see the value of my tokens in relation to the progress I see Arweave making


[25-Feb-19 05:39 AM] digamma889#3785
Yes for me its the same angle. Not interested in selling currently


[25-Feb-19 05:40 AM] bettercallsaul#8215
@arweave-stan are there any other resources at all to figure out an estimated OTC trading value at this time?


[25-Feb-19 05:41 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@bettercallsaul I'm sorry, only base58 can provide such information, unfortunately.


[25-Feb-19 05:45 AM] bettercallsaul#8215
Thank you. And in regards to Arweave’s exchange progress, are you able to share a very generalized timeframe for this goal? (ie the goal is next 3 months, or next 6 months, or next 12 months, etc..)


[25-Feb-19 05:48 AM] bettercallsaul#8215
@arweave-stan sorry didn’t at you. please see above


[25-Feb-19 05:49 AM] arweave-stan#3973
I'm sorry, I can't comment about exchange publicly, we'll make announcement when we can as we already said. Thanks for your understanding  


[25-Feb-19 05:55 AM] bettercallsaul#8215
I would have thought updating a roadmap goal (ie exchange) would be OK. Even companies before that are planning to go public on stock exchanges plan ahead quarterly/annually. 😒

I understand your point  @bettercallsaul but please do understand that is left for exchange to decide when to list a project, and not the other way around.


[25-Feb-19 06:50 AM] ivhturp#3325
@bettercallsaul Base58 was replying to my emails until I asked last OTC price. They never responded to my reminders post that and I heard from atleast one guy its the same for them. Kindly do update us if you get one


[25-Feb-19 07:33 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@bettercallsaul I wrote a lot of e-mails for base58, including the request of AR price - they were all ignored. I sent KYC on my own behalf - they wrote that they do not work with Russia. I asked my acquaintance from Germany to make kyc on my own behalf to help me with access to OTC - Base58 began to demand a lot of documents from him, even those that nobody had ever requested even for Binance... I asked friends from Ukraine and Belarus to do the same - base58 ignored them.


[25-Feb-19 07:34 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan What do you say, because this is your OFFICIAL OTC???


[25-Feb-19 07:42 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@slayer_hellraiser please you should understand every platform has their mode of operation, you don't compare them with binance because they are not the same, also there are regulations in different regions/countries, maybe regulations in Russia does not allow Russians as you said they told you they don't work with Russians. I believe if your friend from Germany did all he was asked to do, I guess he must be fine to use the platform.


[25-Feb-19 07:57 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan nope. They rejected everyone without any explanation. You have chosen the wrong partner.


[25-Feb-19 08:06 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@slayer_hellraiser I'm sorry about the rejection but I believe there must be a reason for the rejection.


[25-Feb-19 08:07 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan Ha! They don't want to explain anything!


[25-Feb-19 08:07 AM] arweave-stan#3973
Is just like when some people submit their kyc documents, the qualified ones get accepted, and others do not.


[25-Feb-19 08:08 AM] arweave-stan#3973
I'm sorry about that, but I do not work with base58


[25-Feb-19 08:08 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
I consider Base58 pure scam


[25-Feb-19 08:09 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@slayer_hellraiser please be mindful with your words, base58 is not a scam and they have not scammed anyone. Be guided. Thanks


[25-Feb-19 08:09 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan Nope. All documents were real, if you hint that I forged them - you are very wrong


[25-Feb-19 08:10 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan I don't believe in Base58. Sorry, but they looks like scam


[25-Feb-19 08:11 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@slayer_hellraiser I never said your documents were forged or not, but I know there must be a reason for the rejection.

Any news about a hardware wallet support?


[25-Feb-19 08:12 AM] arweave-stan#3973
I believe is your choice to believe and disbelief in any platform, but that doesn't give you the right to call them scam as they have not scammed you or anyone. Thanks for your understanding  @slayer_hellraiser


[25-Feb-19 08:13 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Marcin there's no update yet, I'm sorry.


[25-Feb-19 08:14 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
At first they wanted to get a passport scan with a resolution higher than 6000px, then they wanted an ID at the same resolution, and then they simply said that "we didn’t like your documents". In my country, with such a list of documents, I could already have a mortgage without my knowledge (black maklers). And there is only docs for OTC?? I am extremely disappointed in your partner.@arweave-stan


[25-Feb-19 08:18 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
At the moment, I believe more that MtGox will return all the stolen bitcoins, than that anyone has ever traded through Base58. Sorry for misundersatinding, is not a FUD.


[25-Feb-19 09:53 AM] ivhturp#3325
@arweave-stan sorry to say but i second @slayer_hellraiser that Base58 is not a right partner. I also believe that no one has ever traded AR via Base58 - Nothing is transparent with them and I didn't find anyone that has come with positive opinion regarding Base58. 
Forget about last traded price, I dont see any reason why they cannot release statistics such as - AR traded so far on their platform. Any exchange or OTC partner will be ready to  boast with volumes to prove themselves credible/capable, except thats not the case with Base58.

@ivhturp Last OTC price, what I saw for a buying, was about 1 cent per AR


[26-Feb-19 02:03 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
No one buys more expensive than this price now.


[26-Feb-19 03:29 AM] rehash#3438
hah, I buy it all at 1 cent


[26-Feb-19 03:56 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@rehash Well, I just reported the price I saw in the OTC chat.


[26-Feb-19 04:09 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@slayer_hellraiser#5093 please the OTC desk is base58. Do not take anyone to any other OTC platform. Be guided. Thanks for your understanding 


[26-Feb-19 04:11 AM] arweave-stan#3973
Also members should be cautious of scam, many have been victim of OTC scam platform.


[26-Feb-19 04:35 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan base58 is not working. Seriously.This can be confirmed by several people. No one has been able to log in with them...


[26-Feb-19 04:36 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Why not do otc with admins from the chat as an escrow?


[26-Feb-19 05:01 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@slayer_hellraiser for the fact you emailed base58 and they told you what to do, means they are working, but maybe you were unable to reach to their  demands and I don't expect them to go against their policy.


[26-Feb-19 05:04 AM] arweave-stan#3973
I'm sorry, official admins can't offer escrow as it's against our policy.


[26-Feb-19 08:52 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan Well, I, as it were, did not doubt your position.

@slayer_hellraiser thanks for your understanding 


[26-Feb-19 09:12 AM] ivhturp#3325
@slayer_hellraiser 1 cent.. are you serious??? 1.5% of ICO price and cheaper than mining price of probably all the miners!


[26-Feb-19 09:16 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@ivhturp Yes, so seriously


[26-Feb-19 09:17 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan Thanks for my message deleting. Just add OTC channel in discord.


[26-Feb-19 09:19 AM] arweave-stan#3973
#warning  @slayer_hellraiser#5093 please we do not allow OTC advertisement here, next time you advertise OTC, I'll have to mute you.

 I'm sorry, we cannot add OTC channel here, we have an OTC desk which is base58 and if you reach their demands, I know you will be fine with them


[26-Feb-19 09:19 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan Of course, you have the right to delete messages that you do not like. But remember, all you have is community. If he doesn’t like something, the price of a token above one cent may never increase.


[26-Feb-19 09:19 AM] ivhturp#3325
Haha.. deleting may have been the right aproach. It would save people from heart attacks


[26-Feb-19 09:20 AM] ivhturp#3325
Someone was offering 23 cents long back. Not sure now. Hopefully it will increase  


[26-Feb-19 09:22 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@slayer_hellraiser yes, we do delete OTC advertisement in order to protect our community members, because it will make them to fall into scam


[26-Feb-19 09:23 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan In my country there is a saying: if you spit on a community, the community will endure, but if the community spits on you, then learn to swim. I hope that the meaning of this saying will be correctly translated through Google translator


[26-Feb-19 09:23 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan And I can give a lot of examples of what happened to the project when they spit on their community.


[26-Feb-19 09:25 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@slayer_hellraiser like I said before, we don't allow OTC advertisement here, in order to protect the community members from scam. We don't just delete comments, we delete only inappropriate comments. Thanks for your understanding.


[26-Feb-19 09:26 AM] arweave-stan#3973
Secondly, no one has been spat on, the project development is upto date and the team are actively working and delivering good results 


[26-Feb-19 09:27 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan Just look at jet8, Atonomi, UChain, etc...


[26-Feb-19 09:27 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
0,01x i so good for these projects?


[26-Feb-19 09:32 AM] arweave-stan#3973
I've made a comment regarding Atonomi here before but didn't want to go further in order to keep it Arweave related. Please go research in the 3 projects you mentioned and see they are totally incomparable to Arweave, Arweave already has a working product, with upto date development, but the ones you mentioned are projects which stopped development after their token sale, some copied codes from other projects, while some used funds raised to fund another project. Please like I said, all these projects you mentioned are incomparable to Arweave. Thanks for your understanding 


[26-Feb-19 09:33 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan I did not doubt that you would continue to bend your line without even trying to figure it out. Good luck to you there


[26-Feb-19 09:34 AM] arweave-stan#3973
Also Arweave team do constantly communicate with the community. We never go silent even for second.


[26-Feb-19 09:37 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@slayer_hellraiser we understand every frustrations about exchange, but please do bear in mind that the team really cared about the project and the community.


[26-Feb-19 09:37 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
I already wrote to you earlier about OTC, early in the telegram, that in principle you could get away from the concept of scam and fraud, if admins act as escrow for OTC deals. But I understood your position, @arweave-stan. On this note, I stop any talk about OTC.  As the saying goes: if you want to do something well, do it yourself. And do not use helpers


[26-Feb-19 09:38 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
We will find OTC without you


[26-Feb-19 09:40 AM] arweave-stan#3973
Thanks  @slayer_hellraiser, I'm glad you understand our position, that we cannot offer any escrow services.


[26-Feb-19 12:49 PM] chriscord#4741
So a market cap of $230K. Yeah that’s realistic


[26-Feb-19 07:20 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I don’t think that’s realistic at all


[26-Feb-19 07:20 PM] Vilenarios#8742
1 cent is below private presale round


[26-Feb-19 07:21 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Anyone selling at that price is either an idiot or just needs to liquidate their holdings.


[27-Feb-19 01:31 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
I think that there are many such people because a guy who buys 1 cent each AR does not complain about the lack of sellers. I think we will see a cap and less than 230k $


[27-Feb-19 01:33 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
No exchanges -> investors are tired of holding an absolutely illiquid asset -> investors are trying to sell an illiquid asset at any price -> price reduction to the floor


[27-Feb-19 01:35 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
it simple. HODL does not keep the price from falling, because there will always be weak hands.


[27-Feb-19 01:38 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
And towards their sales there will be almost no buys due to lack of liquidity, which will lower the price even lower.


[27-Feb-19 01:38 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
These are just reflections based on the laws of the market. No FUD


[27-Feb-19 01:40 AM] arweave-stan#3973
Dear members, we advise you all to be cautious of scams, do not fall into any unrealistic price. Many have been victim of OTC scam and we wouldn't like to hear such ugly news again. 

And  @slayer_hellraiser I'll advise you to keep the price of your OTC to yourself and do not share it here. Thanks for your understanding.


[27-Feb-19 01:46 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan Your team and you are in the position "dog-in-the-manger": and do not open the official exchange or the OTC, and at the same time scare the unofficial OTC.
What do you think was the reason for the price reduction for the token to the prices I mentioned above?
Do not answer, this is a purely rhetorical question. Into emptiness


[27-Feb-19 01:54 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
My advice: just listen to the community opinion before it's too late.


[27-Feb-19 03:26 AM] Mr_McKska#1848
I've turned off 13 of my dedicated servers with Arweave miners. I don't want to continue to pay for them without a clear understanding of the project perspectives. There is no OTC deck (base58 does not count, it's not working), there are no exchanges. I guess that Arweave Team wants to go on exchange on positive market, it's a good point. But I can't understand why they don't do it now, when we have a green market for some weeks. @arweave-stan just imagine what will happen to the market if BTC will suddenly come to $2000. It will be a disaster and everything will fly to hell. Subsequent period of accumulation will last at least half a year. And there will be no point for Arweave in going to exchange in that period. I think that such a development of the market situation can easily kill the trust of investors in the project and the project itself.

Guys we understand everyone's frustrations, we know everyone need an exchange, but we have explained many times how the exchange works, and regarding the OTC desk, it's working and anyone who reach their criteria of trading with them, the person will be able to do some transaction with them. Please I would like to advise that Arweave is a long term project which in future, will turn out very well for the patience ones. Our team are working very hard to make Arweave project the best and anyone can follow the development of the project. We appreciate everyone's support.

[27-Feb-19 05:08 AM] Mr_McKska#1848
@arweave-stan I know how exchange works. Don't tell me, pls, once again that Arweave is still not integrated in exchanges because of technical difficulties, the Team had enough time to solve any problems since mainnet launch. I'm sure that you have a plan and you stick to it. I just want to tell you that it's now a good time for listing and there is a good chance that there will be no such possibility (green market) later. That's my point.


[27-Feb-19 05:11 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Mr_McKska thanks for your suggestion, we appreciate every suggestion.

@Mr_McKska actually btc 2000 could be  a huge opportunity to get rid of shitcoins, of course I hope AR won't be among them, but if market gets rid of shitcoin that keep draining from eth and btc we'll have a new real bull run


[27-Feb-19 05:44 AM] Mr_McKska#1848
@rehash absolutely agree with you. But yes, not everyone will survive and nobody know can Arweave or not. One thing is for sure - if the project will be listed on exchanges with BTC price ~ $2000, the price of AR won't please anyone.

Dear community members, please be cautious of scam OTC groups, many have fallen victim of some scam OTC groups. Please we wouldn't want to hear such ugly incident again. 

 @slayer_hellraiser#5093 final #warning, only base58 is the OTC desk, do not bring in any other OTC discussion in this channel, and do not lure our community members into any OTC groups. Thanks for your understanding.


[28-Feb-19 12:53 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan no one is luring anyone anywhere. He wanted confirmation, I showed him to him. I did not invite him anywhere. Show correspondence?


[28-Feb-19 12:54 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan Base58 is not working, dude. Stop the dissemination of incorrect information.

[28-Feb-19 01:00 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan If you want to mute me - please, mute. I think everyone will understand that this is only due to the fact that the community opinion was not respected by particular community administrator with watchman syndrome.

[28-Feb-19 01:07 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan Bullshit. They do not like any documents of an absolutely REAL person.

[28-Feb-19 01:11 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093

@arweave-stan All of us are trying to make you understand that Base58 doesn't work - atleast for the **active community here in Discord**. No one wants to do unofficial OTC trades and fall prey to scammers.
`Sincere request - Could you request Base58 to share the trade statistics. ` This would definitely help remove any misconceptions of mine and others.


[01-Mar-19 03:38 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@ivhturp I'm sorry, but I disagree with you that  base58 doesn't work, someone here already said he sent and email and they first said they don't allow users from Russia, then his friend from Germany tried to use them but base58 said the documents submitted is unacceptable. I believe if the friend sent an acceptable documents, he'll definitely be fine and trade with them


[01-Mar-19 03:38 AM] ivhturp#3325
I am not asking for KYC stuff @arweave-stan. I am asking if anyone has ever traded on Base58!

I was also in touch personally with Base58. They never replied after I have asked about last traded AR price or total trade volume. I have sent reminders as well. Kindly suggest me how to proceed in such case?


[01-Mar-19 03:44 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@ivhturp please like I said, I don't work with base58, I believe they must have given you some instructions, which you if you have followed, you'll be fine. Please kindly bear in mind that every platform has their policy, also their mode of operation, we shouldn't expect any platform to get compromised and avoid their due process, we should always abide by their instructions.

@Lasse Clausen I have already added my opinion about this OTC and it sucks. Someone there traded AR?

@Lasse Clausen Please do not defend the team if it cannot protect itself. On the neighboring server of the AR (Arweave Dev Talk), a calm conversation about exchanges, without attacking investors and miners.

@slayer_hellraiser yes I wrote above that I traded on Base58, why do you ask again?


[01-Mar-19 12:33 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093

Hi, I said for the time being...... Isn't that more of a fact currently and not a fud, the channel name is liquidity anyway, and I'm not finding any from anywhere atm.

I'm very sorry if I hurt someone's feeling with my very direct comment. I'm just not a fan of the management style chosen by the team towards token owners. That's all.


[03-Mar-19 04:13 PM] iLion#6786
@Lasse Clausen Honestly, this was the first time I heard of someone successfully used the provided OTC platform. Believe me, I was extremely positively surprised (in case it is true of course). 

I actually got myself already intimidated with the first OTC provider all the way up to the price discussions, but realized soon there is very little chance or liquidity to sell anything. So I can only make assumptions based on my experience on the situation, hardly seeing that as a fud myself. At least based on how I understand the terminology. Situation is what it is. And Arweave is not alone in periferia, let's keep that in mind. 

This is a waiting game now. Miracles has happened before as well, so why not again. I'm reasonable, I'm not ruling out that possibility.

I don't know why everyone is so worried about knowing if base58 is actually selling arweave. It's being sold quite openly on a number of different otc markets. Has been for months. Very easy to find them if you really want to know. But you won't like the answers you find.

@arweave-stan It's clean.. No announced exchange..


[04-Apr-19 05:20 AM] debored2#0542
Until now there has been no clear news concerning exchanges. So you can earn AR by mining but you can not exchange AR for anything else. For now it remains unclear how much AR is worth. We will only know when it is being exchanged what people want to buy is for. So I am wondering what the incentive is for miners to mine AR. Is it purely the trust that it will be exchangeable one day and possibly will moon?


[04-Apr-19 08:16 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Yes, trust in project, trust in team, trust in moon.


[04-Apr-19 08:16 AM] Vilenarios#8742
And idk, for me, its just fun to mine and follow along


[05-Apr-19 07:44 AM] Lasse Clausen#6198
I'm gonna cut the Arweave team some slack. I've been involved with exchange listings and they are a nightmare. Different factions within those companies all trying to ask for listing fees (many times they bag them personally without the exchange company even knowing about it). The engineers super busy fixing bugs, trying to fend of hackers and then being asked to integrate new protocols while they can just add erc20s

Don't be sorry @arweave-stan, I'm sure that's what the team wants. The daily dilution of the AR for months on end is not even been mentioned except by miners in the Dev talk group, who know how much effect it has on AR bought during ICO.


[06-Apr-19 04:22 PM] Ben#7669
Well being that OTC deals are for .10cents per I'd say dilution is compete..next stop 0


[06-Apr-19 10:11 PM] ivhturp#3325
@Ben @st$egg I am both an ICO particpant and miner. I agree that ICO participants will be at a disadvantage. But one thing to remember is that mining rewards given so far are less than ~5% of AR in circulating supply.


[06-Apr-19 10:29 PM] ATLAS#7218
At disadvantage?


[06-Apr-19 10:30 PM] ATLAS#7218
By 72 cent they bought 100 coins by 72USD


[06-Apr-19 10:31 PM] ATLAS#7218
Thats like 2 days of i7 miner and some of the early miners are already in the top 50 wallet or so by only mining.


[06-Apr-19 10:33 PM] ATLAS#7218
They are clearly getting rekt. Not just a mere disadvantage.


[06-Apr-19 10:35 PM] ATLAS#7218
And they can't even get out of this diluting asset. Its like seeing your money getting burnt in a desert. There is nothing you can do but watch.


[06-Apr-19 11:39 PM] ivhturp#3325
@ATLAS Don't get me wrong. I just wanted to highlight that current circulating supply(>40%) can cause more harm than the dilution by miners. And yes, its rekt and not disadvantage


[07-Apr-19 01:11 AM] rehash#3438
@ATLAS yes, I think mining rewards should be reduced to like 25% of what they are now


[07-Apr-19 01:11 AM] rehash#3438

This has been by far the worst project I've participated in. Had so much potential, but a lame duck team. I've watched numerous projects far inferior get liquidity with exchange listing days after token sales. This clown show can't even find one listing after a year let alone give us a straight answer.


[07-Apr-19 01:19 AM] rehash#3438
true, but the product and apps are top class, so I guess you can't just have everything


[07-Apr-19 01:20 AM] rehash#3438
I suggest you to dump your tokens to me for $0.11 and move on to something else


[07-Apr-19 01:20 AM] Ben#7669
Don't think asking for an exchange listing after 1 year is asking for everything.

[07-Apr-19 02:28 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Ben I'm sorry but you can't say this is the worst project you have participated in, because Arweave already has a great product. I think the problem we face in crypto space today, is the rate of support people give to team who're very good in writing a beautiful white paper, and after everything won't still deliver the product/promise, all they could do is to release their token and get  it on exchange, while it pumps, thereby early purchasers making huge profit, and those who bought from them being at high disadvantage. if people focus more on tech, I don't think we'll be facing the problem we're facing today in the crypto space, and there will be less team who're just good in writing beautiful white paper, while there will be more team who're good in the tech. 

Arweave is a utility tokens, so who purchased the tokens have to use the tokens on the network, so I don't see why you said it's your worst investment, while the team have already delivered on the product and still making lots of improvements.

[07-Apr-19 02:34 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@ATLAS I know we're not yet on exchange, to provide more liquidity, but we have an official OTC. But the point I'm trying to make Is, not being on exchange yet is not enough reason to say is the worst investment.


[07-Apr-19 02:34 AM] ATLAS#7218

This project has done better than ETH (and 90% other projects) in the meanwhile and it's not even listed yet. There has been tremendous progress on the tech and development front. I don't see many reasons to complain.

[07-Apr-19 07:34 PM] st$egg#8289
Building on the tech does not prevent the team from providing liquidity, which is a major part of the ICO process. Plus it is the easiest way for new users of a utility token to get access.

Repeating the copy/paste responses "We are in high level talks with exchange" and  "check our announcement channel" for almost a year is simply disregard for those who funded the project during ICO. And this could easily be the worst investment for many, judging from the continuous dilution of the circulating AR daily and the approach the team has decided to handle liquidity.


[07-Apr-19 07:49 PM] st$egg#8289
Its funny how @arweave-stan is sanctimoniously pointing the "problem we're facing today in the crypto space" without any justification. There are countless teams with solid tech that made sure to prioritize liquidity and not take the nauseating OTC approach such as Base58.


[07-Apr-19 08:07 PM] ATLAS#7218
^this. Yes Arweave is better than scam PnD projects. But why are you comparing this project to them? Ethereum is the most respected among developers in this space. Huge developers community. Its sad to see people shittalking Ethereum because of price.


[07-Apr-19 08:08 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@st$egg I'm sorry, if response was repeatedly said, the reason for giving the same answer is because nothing has changed, we don't have new update, and please when we have a new update, we'll definitely share it. Thanks for your understanding 


[07-Apr-19 08:09 PM] ATLAS#7218
Liquidity is not a PnD Stan. I hope you understand what a crucial thing it is.


[07-Apr-19 08:11 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@ATLAS I never said liquidity is PnD or has anything to do with PnD, I was only replying to Ben who said this is his worst investment, and was trying to explain to him.


[07-Apr-19 08:12 PM] ATLAS#7218
You bashed the projects which care about their funders and list immediately


[07-Apr-19 08:13 PM] ATLAS#7218
Yes there will be volatility for a new listing. You cant fix it.


[07-Apr-19 08:13 PM] ATLAS#7218
Its same in every market


[07-Apr-19 08:13 PM] st$egg#8289
Its simply because the Arweave team has no regard for those who funded the project


[07-Apr-19 08:13 PM] ATLAS#7218
Not just in crypto.


[07-Apr-19 08:15 PM] ATLAS#7218
You sound like listing later will make the volatility better. No Stan. Maybe the volume will be much smaller since everyone forgot about it. But thats all. It will still be volatile since we dont have a slight clue of demand and supply.


[07-Apr-19 08:16 PM] ATLAS#7218
Also you can't just take the blame for those who bought the top. There will always be people who bought the top no matter what. Remember.


[07-Apr-19 08:16 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@ATLAS no, I didn't bash any project. I was simply reacting to the reality in crypto today, if you have followed CZ, he also clearly pointed it out to people, and said while we're in bear market, be careful with your pick, that is not every projects that will pick up.


[07-Apr-19 08:17 PM] ATLAS#7218
Liquidity is a good thing no matter what.


[07-Apr-19 08:18 PM] ATLAS#7218
Even legit projects will be PnDed


[07-Apr-19 08:18 PM] ATLAS#7218
Its not their fault.


[07-Apr-19 08:18 PM] st$egg#8289
CZ did not fund Arweave. Binance coin is very liquid.


[07-Apr-19 08:18 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@st$egg I'm sorry, but Arweave team have high regards to the people who funded the project. The core team are always here communicating with the community, no member of the community has been neglected.


[07-Apr-19 08:22 PM] st$egg#8289
Trading is not native to crypto. There will always be two sides of a trade deal, those who buy and those who sell. Whatever side a trader choses to take is up to them. Even BTC price is not immune to PnD, so I don't see the moral justification for raising funds like others and claiming to be different when it comes to providing liquidity.


[07-Apr-19 08:26 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@st$egg actually, we never claimed to be different, we care about the community and have always said that we'll announce about exchange when we can, we understand that everyone want to see Arweave on exchange and we're not neglecting that.


[07-Apr-19 08:26 PM] arweave-stan#3973

@ATLAS This is always a problem. When someone talks about price, such conversations are not encouraged here and they act on @arweave-stan  like a red rag on a bull.

@slayer_hellraiser please try to understand my point, I never said you shared link, I'm only acting based on experience, some people will start a discussion in the group, only to end up bringing up the group they wish to recommend to people, some people will end up sending the person private message to share them with the group's link. So this is why we're extremely Careful and don't allow such discussion that will lead to members asking for the mentioned group/channel link. Thanks for understanding :)

@awkweird I'm sorry, but I'm unable to comment about exchange listing publicly, we'll release an update when we have one.  Thanks


[08-Apr-19 09:39 PM] ivhturp#3325
@arweave-stan The official OTC desk you speak of asks for way too many sensitive details. We are given no choice but to furnish all of them including passport. And you are not ready to take ownership if any mishap happens with the data - All you say is its their responsibility and you have no control despite saying they are your partner.

If only the team clarifies the plans for exchange or have anything to say but "we cannot comment on exchanges", it will prevent Arweave community from going through this inconvenience and privacy concerns.

The amount of disregard for the ICO funders here is astronomical. This channel is almost an insult to everyone's intelligence since there is nothing else except "we cannot comment about exchanges" for almost a year and the announcement channel is where they will "update" about listing.


[09-Apr-19 11:45 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@st$egg I'm sorry, but we don't disregard anyone. Our reply still remain the same because we don't have any update yet. When we have an update, please we'll share to our community. Thanks for your understanding :)

[11-Apr-19 04:35 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan More often it is Google that gives more reliable and truthful information. And yes, I’m talking about it in the project’s chat room, which is positioned as a fighter for the truthfulness of information (but at the same time it often hides and keeps back)


[11-Apr-19 04:39 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@slayer_hellraiser please I never said Google doesn't give reliable information, I just said for the "safety" because I know some fake information could be gotten from Google also.  So in this case, I think for his maximum safety, it better to use the information we provided for him here.

Clearly this the best the team has to offer to the community for liquidity, a terrible OTC with shady mode of operation  and for only deals over $10k.


[12-Apr-19 01:11 AM] Marcin#0065
They should finally stop working with base.


[12-Apr-19 01:11 AM] Marcin#0065

[12-Apr-19 01:39 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@Sedanaa About Base58 They will not answer anything about the price, I asked them repeatedly over the past 3 months and there is still no answer. KYC they consider at least a week and respond to it only when you remind them repeatedly. Very lousy office ..


[12-Apr-19 04:33 AM] awkweird#6550
AFAIK OTCs make the market, directly contact with customers rather than providing the whole market depth and price offer.

@slayer_hellraiser please I could still remember when you said that you emailed them, and they said they don't accept Russians, then your friends emailed and they gave them the instructions of what to do, which I believe if your friends followed the instructions, they'll be fine.


[16-Apr-19 05:26 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan Well, my friends didn’t come either (perhaps due to religious grounds, after all, my friends are not members of the sect who believed in Base58 as a working platform)


[16-Apr-19 05:28 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
And yes, I will say that I really know more about transactions taking place within of OTC TG groups than on Base58 (and, moreover, volumes sometimes exceed 10k USD)

Great, might as well have sold jelly beans instead of tokens, just as worthless. Actually, jellybeans would be better, at least I could eat those. Had you told me day one that there would be zero liquidity a year later for token holders and miners except for some shady OTC desk. There is NO WAY this project would have raised $100K let alone what you raised. Just an absolute debacle this has turned out to be. Sure you're up and running, but so is an 80 year old hooker and I wouldn't touch that with a 10 foot pole. Do everyone right and give the community what it wants, let the market determine what a success Arweave is.


[20-Apr-19 03:40 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan Do you say the words "People are using it" ?? The size of the arweave folder is now 66 GB (and this volume is mostly occupied by absolutely empty blocks), but at the same time DATA STORED is only 1.72 GB. Can you calculate utilization and efficiency yourself? It will be only about 2.6%, which tells us that the system is extremely inefficient.

Great job AR Team at switching to Discord from Telegram to silence anyone complaining about liquidity. Youre on the verge of having the same issue here on Discord

Miners that have been mining for a few months already have more AR than people who contributed the max 50eth during private sale.


[20-Apr-19 10:07 AM] Marcin#0065
hey, I've been following the arweave project since almost the beginning. 
First of all: do not put money Into projects, if you are not able to understand, that the project might not succeed. 
Secondly, if you don't even know what arweave is about, don't invest either. Take some time to read the papers or at least read the information given on the website. Crying afterwards and comparing it to storj etc. makes u look dumb.

And yes, the marketing is poor as hell. There is 0 motivation for fresh people to even start mining. Or even joining the network. It's just a huge waste of energy. Nobody is using that project. Almost no data stored. All the miners do is mining empty blocks and gathering tokens. It's pure speculation now.


[20-Apr-19 10:12 AM] Rabbi#2072
The product is not ready, why would they spend money on marketing


[20-Apr-19 10:14 AM] Rabbi#2072
The focus should not be marketing. It should be providing liquidity


[20-Apr-19 12:38 PM] Marcin#0065
Liquidity what for? As u said, the product is not ready. Marketing is needed, so developer will hear from it, and if they like it, they start using the arweave and build some dapps onto it. 
You can get a free wallet with 5 AR anytime now, so I don't get your point about liquidity.


[20-Apr-19 12:47 PM] Rabbi#2072
Liquidity for investors


[20-Apr-19 12:48 PM] Rabbi#2072
Liquidity so other people could participate in the beta product


[20-Apr-19 12:48 PM] Rabbi#2072
Mainly, liquidity for investors


[20-Apr-19 12:48 PM] Rabbi#2072
And most importantly


[20-Apr-19 12:54 PM] Marcin#0065
There have been some sales already. Not their fault about bad timing of the investors


[20-Apr-19 12:58 PM] Rabbi#2072
Marcin, what are you even talking about


[20-Apr-19 12:58 PM] Rabbi#2072
I remember you from the Telegram room, I even have PMs from you about how you are bailing on this project and that the team has failed its investors


[20-Apr-19 01:01 PM] st$egg#8289
Marcin is probably adding to the joke, overall. Arweave is trying very hard to be a real joke.


[20-Apr-19 01:17 PM] rehash#3438
I know it sucks to not have exchange, but you should check Arweave youtube channel, they delivered some really cool stuff in the last 2 months.


[20-Apr-19 01:18 PM] rehash#3438
About exchange maybe they just can't afford to pay, they didn't raised very much.


[20-Apr-19 01:18 PM] rehash#3438
I mean filecoin raised like 30x more


[20-Apr-19 01:27 PM] Rabbi#2072
They have said its not because of the money


[20-Apr-19 01:27 PM] Rabbi#2072
So your excuse for them is not valid


[20-Apr-19 01:28 PM] Rabbi#2072
And if they dont have enough money now, they wont have enough money later. It's not like they make any revenue


[20-Apr-19 01:29 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Exactly


[20-Apr-19 01:32 PM] rehash#3438
this is all speculation, I have no idea how they are with money, but when you are tight on $, you can do like every vaporware and pay for a listing and deliver nothing... or you can deliver a great product and eventually someone will list without fee


[20-Apr-19 01:33 PM] rehash#3438
even big names like ICX, OMG, WAN are listed everywhere but they don't have product, all hype


[20-Apr-19 01:33 PM] rehash#3438
so those which keep complaining may want to move towards this kind of coins


[20-Apr-19 01:36 PM] rehash#3438
AR token has a very clear purpose and usage. For instance BAT is a great project, Brendan Eich is huge, they are delivering, they are well listed, but the token itself is completely useless.


[20-Apr-19 01:47 PM] Rabbi#2072
AR doesnt have a product either. They are no different than ICO, OMG, and WAN. And if you are argument is that they do have a product then its even more embarrassing that AR cannot get listed after 1 year since ICO, while there are such terrible projects like ICX, OMG, WAN which are listed everywhere

Are there any public run tg groups for arweave? I think it’s high time that the next course of action is discussed


[01-May-19 04:09 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Champion please we’re only on discord, as discord's multi-channel feature allows for different areas for different topics of discussion. This allows for focused conversations without conversations getting fragmented and everyone needing to talk over each other in one big group, which could cause some meaningful conversations to get lost and confused. Anyone can follow conversations they are interested in, and ignore topics they wish to. Thanks for your understanding 


[01-May-19 04:13 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@Champion TG groups are dead. Previously, we used them, but for some reason everyone was transferred forcibly into Discord. In TG groups they remove any dissent (as well as thoughts too)...

Hi, is this project still engineer lead exercise with no clue about marketing and product delivery?


[02-May-19 05:39 AM] iLion#6786
ie. there is not yet ANY official place for anyone to buy and/or sell tokens (tokens are required to use the platform), in case they would find the usecase to be even remotely useful?


[02-May-19 05:42 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@iLion please at the moment, you can use an OTC desk to trade Ar tokens, if you're interested in making use of an OTC desk, feel free to drop us an email team@arweave.org. We'll be glad to send you details on how to contact an OTC desk. Thanks for your understanding

So much for being 'decentralized'


[02-May-19 01:04 PM] Justifier93#1031
What dont you just try to list somewhere? Locking your tokens forever will only make the dump bigger eventually


[03-May-19 05:01 AM] Champion#0757
It’s quite obvious that they don’t care fellas. We’ve been hearing the same thing for nearly a year. All investors should consider the word that starts with L and ends in T. It’s the only way to hold them accountable

why do you need escrow when you don't have buyer at 30?

[11-May-19 07:43 AM] rehash#3438
and for the sake of logic, is someone (base58) does not work with Russians, it does not mean they are scammers


[11-May-19 07:46 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@rehash thanks for your understanding, it's still same with some exchanges, not every countries/regions every exchange do accept. I believe they all have their policy.


[11-May-19 07:47 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@rehash They also do not work with Ukrainians, Belarusians, Germans and Swiss (I listed the nationalities of my friends who tried to register there). And I have the only conclusion: Base58 is a SCAM.


[11-May-19 07:51 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan Of course, it’s better to let community members fall for the scammers, but the team will never touch a finger to protect against this. Thank you, I said everything.


[11-May-19 07:51 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
I do not like this position of the team, you always keep silent about the answers to ACTUAL QUESTIONS, ON ACTUAL. You answer only questions that are not inconvenient for you. It is so?


[11-May-19 07:53 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan  @rehash I will not argue with you, I have already added my opinion about the team and I am not going to continue to keep team tokens that support scammers (Base58).


[11-May-19 07:53 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@slayer_hellraiser #last-warning. please be mindful with your words, base58 is not a scam, many exchanges also have countries they do not allow, and same with base58, I'd advised you to ask them the countries they allow, and use anyone from such country. Please do not call them a scam because they don't accept those from the restricted countries who tried to use them. Please be guided and don't expect them to go against their policy. Thanks


[11-May-19 07:54 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan Not convinced ..


[11-May-19 07:55 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
I don't believe you, your team and the more I do not believe Base58. Give at least one example of a successful deal on Base58 with AR, of course.


[11-May-19 07:56 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
There are no such examples, right, @arweave-stan ?


[11-May-19 07:56 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
And again you do not answer questions that you are uncomfortable.


[11-May-19 07:58 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@slayer_hellraiser some people who have used base58 have said here, that they have used it and it worked fine.  I think you should scroll up, you'll be able to see comments of those who used it and it was fine with them.


[11-May-19 08:01 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan I have not seen these comments before or now. And do not forget, I'm here from the very beginning, as you closed the telegrams and drove everyone here.


[11-May-19 08:01 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
And again you do not answer questions that you are uncomfortable.


[11-May-19 08:02 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan Base58 do not report the countries with which they work.


[11-May-19 08:03 AM] arweave-stan#3973
Please I disagree with you by not answering uncomfortable questions, I and team always answer everyone's questions in the channel, except some sensitive questions that we're unable to comment on publicly, such as exchange, which might bring a problem towards the progress due to NDA.


[11-May-19 08:04 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@slayer_hellraiser please I don't work with base58, so I'm afraid to comment further about them. Thanks


[11-May-19 08:04 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
You simply do not have answers to such awkward questions, because you yourself do not know these answers. Not NDA, not.


[11-May-19 08:05 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
About Base58: But however you recommend them as the ONLY ONE OTC


[11-May-19 08:07 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
This is a useless conversation with you, @arweave-stan . You still do not answer my questions, but I don’t want to spend my time talking to a lousy team and a lousy community manager who don’t care about the community.


[11-May-19 08:27 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Any other (good) community manager would simply check with your recommended OTC with which country they work, what documents they might need, etc. Similarly defined a good team and a good community manager,@arweave-stan . In your case, you and your team don’t care about your community.


[11-May-19 08:29 AM] rehash#3438
This is decentralized, you are free to use any OTC you wish. But finding buyer for the specific price that you have in mind is not the job of the team/community manager.


[11-May-19 08:30 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan  You have the same impression with the recommended OTC that they do not work with you and you don't work with they too. So why do you recommend them then? Just contact and specify about my questions, this is your OTC


[11-May-19 08:32 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@rehash I did not say that the manager should help me sell. I talked about the fact that I have a buyer, but there is no escrow. In many (almost all) projects, community managers help with this issue. In the same community, the manager spits on the community.


[11-May-19 08:33 AM] rehash#3438
You seem not new in the space, I'm sure you will find a way to get an escrow. I like that team does not involve in these things. They avoid regulation issues, that's actually smart long term.


[11-May-19 08:35 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@rehash It seems to me that they do not care. And there are many projects with a similar attitude to the community. And these projects are much worse than the bottom (the second and third bottom as a gift ...)


[11-May-19 08:41 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@slayer_hellraiser please let me explain it better and further. It's just like when a project is listed on exchange, every enquiries you want to make about the exchange, you should simply Contact the exchange, and their support will attend to you and not the project's support/community manager. We have given base58 contact for those who wished to use the OTC desk, so I believe any enquiries/issues, it's left base58 support to attend to it.


[11-May-19 08:42 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
In short, everything is clear with you.


[11-May-19 08:42 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Base58 support ignored these questions, i wrote you about it many times...


[11-May-19 06:19 PM] Ben#7669

Well overdue for that lawsuit. I’ve already contacted my lawyer and I urge every other investor to get legal advice. We have a strong case. I’m also in the process of contacting the SEC


[14-May-19 01:30 AM] rehash#3438
@Champion Why do you contact SEC for? 1) Arweave is not US based 2) Arweave is not a security, it is actually one of the very few projects with strong utility use case.

We should really go for a top exchange now. It would be worth it I believe. There does seem to be a lot of interest in the OTC market. We could do pretty well if listing goes well.

@rehash even if Arweave is outside the SEC’s reach, for the sake of investors it is only right that they are alerted. Whatever comes of it can only help investors who are not being treated fairly. Also considering that Arweave is doing promotional events in New York, they will definitely be of interest to the SEC


[14-May-19 08:21 AM] uno#0009
@Champion  the right place is FCA ,UK and not SEC. Also promotional events,showcasing the technology etc is not soliciting investments and so it is not purview of SEC to act


[16-May-19 12:25 AM] Champion#0757
@uno no harm in alerting the relevant authorities

If he wins the lawsuit he can get some cash instead of some *useful* tokens

So not exactly completely losing XD. Actually he wont lose the 600AR just because he is filing a lawsuit.

if team gets caught with lawsuits they will have less time for developments and also less money hence the token value will decrease

i am here since ICO can't believe one year and no exchange

@uno please I'm unable to comment about exchange publicly, and please it is actually the very fact that we have developers building things and a real product that gets people excited, regarding integration, please be aware that Arweave was code from the scratch without forking any existing project, it is harder to integrate than an ERC-20 or Nep5. Thanks for your understanding


[16-May-19 09:37 AM] uno#0009
@arweave-stan  and arweare is not the first or last to code from scratch.I ma not bother if you will be listing in 2021 or 2021 ..but can you care to explain that exchange integrations and 'stories' about talks with exchange  is not bluff or to buy time


[16-May-19 09:37 AM] uno#0009
[hope you will not delete the telegram chats or close the channel ..(I have video recorded all chats *frame-by-frame* ,just in case ) ]


[16-May-19 09:38 AM] uno#0009
Just prove me that you were indeed in talks with exchange for listings and  integration was on (no need to to about your agreements..but some solid proof]


[16-May-19 09:38 AM] uno#0009
if you can't then I will think it is attempt to scam.


[16-May-19 09:44 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@uno please like I said before, I'm afraid, I can't comment on exchange publicly, and regarding "attempt to scam" please if you have been following the project development, our team are active developing and we have been rolling out updates all the time, we're also active in the channel to answer and address everyone's concerns.

The blatant disregard for ico participants continues. This has truly become a joke of a team. Playing with words for a year and lying about been in high talks with exchanges for that long. Just nauseating to say the least. Arweave is not doing anything new with coding from scratch. The team here has zero regard for investors and its obvious now. Some folks still think there is any sincerity in the generic responses from @arweave-stan, perhaps they need more time to see how this folks think - its out of touch with reality of what happens in the crypto space. Investing in AR gives zero ownership to the project, the very least they could do is get liquidity on exchanges and not push a shady OTC on the community. Simply reading through the chat here shows that they don't care a bit about what the community thinks. There are terms in psychiatry to describe this team's approach, for anyone who wishes to know. Expect the pointless "please...." response, y'all. Cheers!


[22-May-19 02:11 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@st$egg firstly, the team haven't disregarded anyone, we care about the community members and we're always here to answer and address everyone's concerns. And it's actually the very fact that we have developers building things and a real product that gets people excited, regarding exchange, please be aware that Arweave was code from the scratch without forking any existing project, it is harder to integrate than an ERC-20 or Nep5. We'll release news about exchange when we can and our team are still reaching out to many exchanges. Thanks for your understanding 


[22-May-19 02:16 PM] st$egg#8289
Lol. Copy/paste same old repitittion for the last year. Keep enjoying yourself @arweave-stan, you clearly must be. I have long gotten the message the team is passing across. I'm sure we dont have only ERC-20 or Nep5 tokens in the crypto space.


[23-May-19 02:23 AM] ATLAS#7218
Poor stan. You need some raise for being put in this position xd


[23-May-19 02:25 AM] ATLAS#7218
maybe you can ask sam to visit and clarify some stuff. surely it will satisfy the members more than your *very informative msg*


[23-May-19 02:25 AM] ATLAS#7218
Just tell us whats wrong with the chain. Its pretty clear at this point that some design decision has been made badly, causing problems to list.


[23-May-19 02:26 AM] ATLAS#7218
Its not just liquidity, you guys are putting us in the dark.


[23-May-19 02:27 AM] ATLAS#7218
Anyone will go insane if they are left in a dark room with few tokens to play with for 1 year.


[23-May-19 02:49 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@ATLAS actually, we're not putting anyone in the dark, Arweave is an open source which anyone can review the code and see that there's nothing wrong, and the network works properly, the update I'm giving is the available update, and when there's a new update, I'll so update the community members again. If anyone who contributed to Arweave during token sale, did for the tech and not for the hype, with current Arweave progress, I doubt if the person will be worried about the project at this point. Please I'll update the community when we have new update. Thanks❤️


[23-May-19 02:54 AM] ATLAS#7218
Why is it not listed now?


[23-May-19 02:54 AM] ATLAS#7218
after 1 year?


[23-May-19 02:54 AM] ATLAS#7218
enlighten us pls


[23-May-19 02:55 AM] ATLAS#7218
I was siding with you but it seems you don't understand ICO participants because you didnt participate/you joined late to Arweave.


[23-May-19 02:56 AM] ATLAS#7218
There is something wrong with the integration and you guys are putting us in the dark


[23-May-19 02:57 AM] ATLAS#7218
noone cares about that regular  update of "we just talked in blah2"


[23-May-19 02:59 AM] ATLAS#7218
There is hundreds of weird chains out there, listed in some sort of exchange.


[23-May-19 03:00 AM] ATLAS#7218
I guess only thing that makes this chain special is not being able to list on exchange after 1 year of *high level talks*


[23-May-19 03:21 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@ATLAS I've explained how exchange works, and we're still talking to exchanges, but for update, I'm afraid, getting exchanges to integrate a from-scratch, non-fork native token like this when they could list 100 ERC-20s with the same amount of effort is hard. Also I've said it's actually the very fact that we have developers building things and a real product that gets people excited. We really appreciate your support :)


[23-May-19 03:24 AM] itaintpriddy#4487
Just my two cents worth, I can't predict price for this project, but look at Cosmos ICO...took two years to be released on exchange

Cosmos is ERC-20


[23-May-19 03:45 AM] ATLAS#7218
They didn't list because they didn't want. And the ICO guys knew it.


[23-May-19 03:46 AM] ATLAS#7218
While in AR, you wait 1 year thinking listing can be 1 week later.


[23-May-19 03:46 AM] ATLAS#7218
And stan, as I and others pointed out, AR is not the only one who has mainnet.


[23-May-19 03:47 AM] ATLAS#7218
There is DAG, fractals, snowfield etc. structures beyond your imagination.


[23-May-19 03:48 AM] ATLAS#7218
And guess what, they just listed without 1 year of highlevel talks


[23-May-19 03:50 AM] ATLAS#7218
You know and I know. This is not normal. There is some problem with the chain and you guys are hiding it.


[23-May-19 03:52 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@ATLAS please there's no problem in the chain, like I said before, Arweave is an open source and you can review the code, the network is already in use and no one has ever complained not working.


[23-May-19 03:53 AM] ATLAS#7218
I didnt say its  working. I didn't say its closed source. There is some problem with exchange integration.


[23-May-19 03:54 AM] ATLAS#7218
I can't send 2 transactions in 1 block. Here. Now there is a complaint.

Arweave is listed on an exchange: https://a1.exchange


[26-May-19 09:13 AM] DesignBlock#0184
Is this official?


[26-May-19 09:24 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@shiggidy no, please there's no discord OTC group.


[26-May-19 09:26 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
We can’t endorse this website as we cannot verify their quality, security, or reliability. They did not work with us on the integration, so we also can’t confirm the accuracy of this, either. Please be extraordinarily careful if you decide to take the risk of trading there, as you would if trading on an untrusted OTC market @DesignBlock


[26-May-19 09:32 AM] shiggidy#4554
if it helps any, i do have history with a1


[26-May-19 09:32 AM] shiggidy#4554
also i am an admin/escrow in a discord otc that can add discord trading for arweave if the team doesnt mind

@arweave-stan    People invested money in technology? And they should be satisfied? Do you yourself understand what nonsense you are talking about?
People invest money to make more money.  We are investors, not a charity fund to support poor programmers Arweave.   

Give me all your money, I am also developing a cool technology. It will change the world. You will see.
And just wait a year.

There will be no where to live and what to eat? It does not matter, but in a year, and maybe two, I will release technology. 

What will be used by 5 people. Not anymore, because I will not deal with marketing. After all, cool technology. People themselves will notice them. 

Stop thinking that you are more cunning than investors. And the fact that at least some of them need a Github code. Useless code. We need to eat and pay for the apartment, and not to admire the code

If A1 works out that’s both good and bad, might see a dump if it’s not endorsed by the team, but it’s also a good outlet for those wishing to exit early

@Sedanaa On A1 volume of 30 dollars.That's horrible


[27-May-19 02:32 AM] Sedanaa#7524
Yeah but I mean if they’ve managed to integrate AR with their exchange it atleast provides a source for liquidity

[27-May-19 02:33 AM] Sedanaa#7524
If AR company itself supports being listed on this exchange and announces it, people will be more inclined to trust it and that’s where you will see volume come in


[27-May-19 02:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
@Sedanaa There is no problem integrating AR. The team probably just does nothing for it.  If not known exchange A1 could integrate, then why others are not?


[27-May-19 02:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think the answer is obvious


[27-May-19 02:43 AM] shiggidy#4554
a1 is very innovative and they take steps further than other exchanges


[27-May-19 02:43 AM] shiggidy#4554
they dont mind working with new codebases to integrate


[27-May-19 02:43 AM] shiggidy#4554
whereas other exchanges want their hand held to integrate


[27-May-19 02:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
@shiggidy Yes, they are better than Binance, Huobi, Upbit or Bitmax. I do not even doubt


[27-May-19 02:48 AM] Sedanaa#7524
I feel you’re too emotionally invested @Deleted User , Take a step back and have a look at the market and all the announcements AR has been making, constant talks at blockchain events and raising awareness before an exchange launch


[27-May-19 02:48 AM] Sedanaa#7524
I guarantee if we listed in the bear market you’d get dumped on hard


[27-May-19 02:49 AM] Sedanaa#7524
This turn of market momentum interests new money and new money doing research on what to invest in can find Arweave through all these blockchain events and web interviews


[27-May-19 02:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
@Sedanaa I believe people who do, and not say. While I only hear promises for a year.


[27-May-19 03:07 AM] Champion#0757
Yes the elephant in the room is that for nearly a year, we were told that it’s harder to list arweave due to integration complexity with it being a whole new blockchain. I’m not doubting that. But when some obscure exchange manages to list arweave, without the help of the team, it certainly throws a spanner in the works and makes you question what we’ve been told.


[27-May-19 03:10 AM] shiggidy#4554
nah dont question what the team has told ya, im new to this community but ive seen other projects with unique codebases have the same issues


[27-May-19 03:10 AM] shiggidy#4554
very few exchanges are able to custom integrate a new codebase


[27-May-19 03:11 AM] shiggidy#4554
a1 and maybe qtrade


[27-May-19 03:11 AM] shiggidy#4554
are the only two that come to mind


[27-May-19 03:11 AM] shiggidy#4554
and willing to take a shot on quality new projects

@shiggidy,  1 year.  Is this time enough?


[27-May-19 03:12 AM] shiggidy#4554
no its not lol


[27-May-19 03:12 AM] shiggidy#4554
like i said most exchanges dont want to do anything outside their normal routine


[27-May-19 03:12 AM] shiggidy#4554
and its easy to integrate a btc fork


[27-May-19 03:12 AM] shiggidy#4554
same codebase


[27-May-19 03:12 AM] shiggidy#4554
nearly identical integration to their database/platform


[27-May-19 03:12 AM] shiggidy#4554
easy to interact with the node


[27-May-19 03:13 AM] shiggidy#4554
with a new codebase the exchange may need to code out custom code to interpret the data from the node


[27-May-19 03:13 AM] shiggidy#4554
and thats what holds most of them back


[27-May-19 03:13 AM] shiggidy#4554
or their unwillingness to do that


[27-May-19 03:13 AM] shiggidy#4554
as they dont see it worth the time/money if the volume may not be there


[27-May-19 03:32 AM] ATLAS#7218
They rejected the offer of qtrade to list.


[27-May-19 03:32 AM] ATLAS#7218
Just putting it there since you are blaming everything on exchanges.


[27-May-19 03:33 AM] shiggidy#4554
qtrade has a listing fee i believe

[27-May-19 03:34 AM] ATLAS#7218
They kindly asked if theycan list


[27-May-19 03:34 AM] shiggidy#4554
.1 to 2 btc


[27-May-19 03:34 AM] ATLAS#7218
I asked qtrade


[27-May-19 03:34 AM] shiggidy#4554
yeah they always ask


[27-May-19 03:34 AM] shiggidy#4554
but then they ask for payment too lol


[27-May-19 03:34 AM] ATLAS#7218

[27-May-19 03:34 AM] ATLAS#7218
He got ignored


[27-May-19 03:34 AM] Marcin#0065
Marketing is just horrible, nobody can deny it. If even exchanges like a1 list AR outside of the arweave team knowing or collaborating, it says all.


[27-May-19 03:34 AM] Marcin#0065
But AR is cool


[27-May-19 03:34 AM] ATLAS#7218
Eric believed it would bring volume to qtrade


[27-May-19 03:34 AM] shiggidy#4554
he can list it without the AR team


[27-May-19 03:34 AM] shiggidy#4554
i dont understand why he even needs to ask


[27-May-19 03:35 AM] ATLAS#7218
Because thats what exchanges normally do. Otherwise after all the hassle team can just ask them to delist


[27-May-19 03:35 AM] shiggidy#4554
lol no its not


[27-May-19 03:35 AM] shiggidy#4554
exchanges just list by themselvevs


[27-May-19 03:35 AM] shiggidy#4554
they dont ask


[27-May-19 03:36 AM] shiggidy#4554
if they want it, they download the software and run it, then connect it to their exchange database


[27-May-19 03:36 AM] shiggidy#4554
the team cant stop anyone from listing it


[27-May-19 03:36 AM] ATLAS#7218
Did you look at IDEX delisting coins?


[27-May-19 03:36 AM] ATLAS#7218
Because of team request?


[27-May-19 03:36 AM] shiggidy#4554

Kek raven hasnt seen enough of this space


[27-May-19 03:37 AM] Marcin#0065
The team could welcome the effort of a1 exchanges as one of the first ones listing it. But all they do is saying, they didn't work together and we need to be careful as with otc trading. Sad.


[27-May-19 03:38 AM] shiggidy#4554
raven got listed on exchanges without a "team request"


[27-May-19 03:38 AM] shiggidy#4554
exchanges just list it


[27-May-19 03:38 AM] ATLAS#7218
Yeah but if they ask to delist


[27-May-19 03:38 AM] ATLAS#7218
They would have to.


[27-May-19 03:38 AM] shiggidy#4554
no they wouldnt lol


[27-May-19 03:38 AM] shiggidy#4554
its like a core developer asking an exchange to delist btc


[27-May-19 03:38 AM] shiggidy#4554

[27-May-19 03:39 AM] shiggidy#4554
its the equivalent of the team asking you to stop running your node


[27-May-19 03:39 AM] shiggidy#4554
you dont need to stop running your node


[27-May-19 03:39 AM] ATLAS#7218
Its not about just running a node


[27-May-19 03:39 AM] shiggidy#4554
yes it is lol


[27-May-19 03:39 AM] ATLAS#7218
Ok. Then I shouldve operated an exchnage by myself


[27-May-19 03:39 AM] shiggidy#4554
an exchange is just running a node and creating bridge code to link into their platform database


[27-May-19 03:40 AM] ATLAS#7218
I had multiple AR nodes


[27-May-19 03:40 AM] shiggidy#4554
yeah if you're smart enough to do so, go ahead


[27-May-19 03:40 AM] shiggidy#4554
just RPC into your node


[27-May-19 03:40 AM] shiggidy#4554
create a database


[27-May-19 03:40 AM] shiggidy#4554
and a UI for users to interact


[27-May-19 03:40 AM] shiggidy#4554
and change your database


[27-May-19 03:40 AM] ATLAS#7218
I could operate 10 exchanges


[27-May-19 03:40 AM] shiggidy#4554
yep


[27-May-19 03:40 AM] ATLAS#7218
Damn. hahahah


[27-May-19 03:40 AM] shiggidy#4554
nothing stops you or anyone else from doing it


[27-May-19 03:41 AM] ATLAS#7218
Good to hear your 1 year of experience.


[27-May-19 03:41 AM] Marcin#0065
I'm going to hack Baz then steal all AR. Probably that's one risky point of not running an exchange :)


[27-May-19 03:42 AM] ATLAS#7218
I have seen multiple occasions of team delisting from some exchanges by requesting. Any ethical exchange would delist upon request.


[27-May-19 03:42 AM] ATLAS#7218
Do you know any occasion of some exchange rejecting it?


[27-May-19 03:42 AM] ATLAS#7218
It would be very helpful if you know such case


[27-May-19 03:45 AM] shiggidy#4554
hmm not so much in terms of exchanges rejecting it, but low liquidity new exchanges listing very small community projects and the developer says they dont endorse the exchange, the exchange still keeps it


[27-May-19 03:46 AM] ATLAS#7218
Thats different from requesting to delist


[27-May-19 03:46 AM] shiggidy#4554
rarely do i see developers specifically asking to delist


[27-May-19 03:46 AM] ATLAS#7218
So you have no experience with it.


[27-May-19 03:46 AM] shiggidy#4554
i dont think i have


[27-May-19 03:46 AM] shiggidy#4554
ive seen developers not give support to list


[27-May-19 03:46 AM] ATLAS#7218
Ok. Thats very unfortunate.


[27-May-19 03:46 AM] shiggidy#4554
thats quite normal


[27-May-19 03:46 AM] shiggidy#4554
they tell the exchange if you want it, go ahead and do it


[27-May-19 03:47 AM] shiggidy#4554
but in terms of saying "if you list it, we'll ask you to delist it" no thats very odd


[27-May-19 03:47 AM] ATLAS#7218
Yeah but qtrade Eric is operating a very nice exchange with a lot of decent project.


[27-May-19 03:47 AM] ATLAS#7218
if the team doesnt want it. he wont bother.


[27-May-19 03:47 AM] shiggidy#4554
i agree, but he doesnt need the developers approval to list


[27-May-19 03:47 AM] shiggidy#4554
he can do it himself if he wants to


[27-May-19 03:48 AM] ATLAS#7218
He would delist it upon team request


[27-May-19 03:48 AM] ATLAS#7218
So he basically is asking for approval to avoid that situation


[27-May-19 03:48 AM] ATLAS#7218
I didnt say he is incapable of listing. Did I?


[27-May-19 03:49 AM] shiggidy#4554
lol man, the team isnt gunna ask to delist it


[27-May-19 03:49 AM] shiggidy#4554
its a cop out


[27-May-19 03:50 AM] shiggidy#4554
they will just say they dont endorse the exchange


[27-May-19 03:50 AM] ATLAS#7218
Yeah so whats so wrong with approving an exchange


[27-May-19 03:50 AM] ATLAS#7218
Ok you can list


[27-May-19 03:50 AM] shiggidy#4554
because if there is a problem with that exchange people will blame the team for endorsing it


[27-May-19 03:50 AM] ATLAS#7218
But the team doesnt have to officially endorse


[27-May-19 03:51 AM] ATLAS#7218
So?


[27-May-19 03:51 AM] ATLAS#7218
Whats the reason for ghosting Eric.


[27-May-19 03:51 AM] shiggidy#4554
and eric doesnt specifically need to ask for permission


[27-May-19 03:51 AM] shiggidy#4554
he can just do it


[27-May-19 03:51 AM] ATLAS#7218
He asks because he is polite.


[27-May-19 03:51 AM] shiggidy#4554
its open source you dont needa ask anything


[27-May-19 03:51 AM] ATLAS#7218
And he asks because it will be more easy too


[27-May-19 03:52 AM] ATLAS#7218
Listing is different from just looking at the code


[27-May-19 03:52 AM] ATLAS#7218
Here we go again.


[27-May-19 03:52 AM] ATLAS#7218
It seems you have no reading capability.


[27-May-19 03:54 AM] ATLAS#7218
He didnt ask for listing fee. So what is the reason for arweave team rejecting the offer


[27-May-19 03:54 AM] ATLAS#7218
Just tell me that.


[27-May-19 03:54 AM] shiggidy#4554
man you're insufferable


[27-May-19 03:55 AM] ATLAS#7218

[27-May-19 04:34 AM] shiggidy#4554
but the only reason i took an interest in this project is bc its still around


[27-May-19 04:34 AM] shiggidy#4554
after they raised funds


[27-May-19 04:34 AM] shiggidy#4554
so i figure they must be doing something


[27-May-19 04:34 AM] rehash#3438
with other projects it is clear the money is lost, really, so many vaporware, but here there is still chance and that makes it harder for them


[27-May-19 04:35 AM] shiggidy#4554
i gotta say first impression of the project with no freaking bootstrap image is such a turn off lol

@DaVinci  no, only some small rewards since block 65700 and full rewards only from 95000 or something close


[12-Feb-19 09:45 PM] Ozymandias#2082
Will there be gpu mining or only cpu?


[13-Feb-19 01:05 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@Ozymandias Only CPU, without ASIC, FPGA, GPU and others cheaters gadgets


[13-Feb-19 01:23 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Ozymandias CPU is best tailored for Arweave mining - The hashing algorithm used underneath the proof of access mechanism in the Arweave is
SHA2-384, for which the CPU is the most efficient miner currently available. We'd be happy to send over a mining guide if you like. Just drop us an email at team@arweave.org :)


[13-Feb-19 02:36 AM] Mazzz#1871
@arweave-stan There will likely be GPU and ASIC mining soon as the algorithm is similar to bitcoin's


[13-Feb-19 02:46 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@Mazzz Mining ASIC for data storage? Ok. What will you store data in ASIC, GPU and FPGA If they will be, say, at least a couple of terabytes?


[13-Feb-19 03:11 AM] Mazzz#1871
@slayer_hellraiser storage is a separate thing from mining no?


[13-Feb-19 03:25 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@Mazzz In this case, it is inseparable


[13-Feb-19 05:29 AM] Mazzz#1871
@slayer_hellraiser surely you can mine with a GPU because it is just a hashing algorithm like any other and process data with the cpu


[13-Feb-19 05:37 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@Mazzz I don't think so


[13-Feb-19 06:00 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Mazzz yes, you can mine with GPU, but for the best experience, we recommend CPU.


[13-Feb-19 06:00 AM] Mazzz#1871
@arweave-stan why is this so?


[13-Feb-19 06:03 AM] arweave-stan#3973
Like I said before, the hashing algorithm used underneath the proof of access mechanism in the Arweave is
SHA2-384, therefore CPU is the most efficient miner.


[13-Feb-19 06:04 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I’ve never used an ASIC before.  Can you even connect them to a larger storage array?


[13-Feb-19 06:05 AM] Vilenarios#8742
But if you look at enterprise web servers and databases, they aren’t ASICs


[13-Feb-19 06:05 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Normal compute/storage platforms.


[13-Feb-19 06:06 AM] Vilenarios#8742
But who knows. I’m sure if the reward was there someone would try to build some integrated asic arweave server


[13-Feb-19 06:07 AM] Mazzz#1871
@arweave-stan Bitcoin started with CPU miners initially as it was the most efficient until GPU miners were developed. Surely if adoption grows people will find a way to hash Sha2-384 with a GPU or asic


[13-Feb-19 06:08 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Bitcoin doesn’t/won’t have many terabytes of storage and ASICS don’t have to retrieve and serve these files over the internet.


[13-Feb-19 06:08 AM] Vilenarios#8742
So I think that’s the key difference.


[13-Feb-19 06:09 AM] Vilenarios#8742
@arweave-sam or one of the other team members, when do the AR rewards reduce? At what block? It’s my understanding that the first year is higher rewards then the rest.


[13-Feb-19 06:09 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Can you post the rewards schedule here?


[13-Feb-19 06:10 AM] tiamat#9131
it's already gradually reducing


[13-Feb-19 06:11 AM] tiamat#9131
but yeah, I think there will be a big drop somewhere around summer


[13-Feb-19 06:13 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Mazzz please reread my previous comments, I said CPU is more efficient currently, but didn't rule out mining with GPU completely.


[13-Feb-19 06:19 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Mazzz yh, Bitcoin mining was exclusively CPU based, before GPU. I believe with adoption, at some point, there will be better Arweave mining experience with GPU.


[13-Feb-19 06:20 AM] Mazzz#1871
@arweave-stan Ah. Wait so does that mean you guys have tried GPU mining but it wasn't efficient?


[13-Feb-19 06:23 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Mazzz I'm not really a miner or a developer, just sharing with my understanding. But I can help you to confirm please.


[13-Feb-19 10:37 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Vilenarios 262800 is the blockheight at which the rewards reduce.


[13-Feb-19 10:43 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Mazzz just so I confirm, like I said before, the hashing algorithm used underneath the proof of access mechanism in the Arweave is SHA2-384, for which the CPU is the most efficient miner currently available. So essentially, miners should focus first on storage, then on hashing. We also intend to move to genprog which will render GPUs ineffective.

I have followed at least 10 new blockchains started during the last year and I have to say that Arweave is the most stable. The very hyped Zilliqa has lots of issues and needs patches almost every day.

hi team, is this list of peers actual? 
peer 52.56.119.91 peer 34.216.88.202 \
peer 54.93.54.173 peer 18.130.126.49 \

[06-Mar-19 07:19 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@ivanovich I think, your list is outdated. You can find the currently recommended peers in the mining guide - https://docs.arweave.org/info/mining/mining-guide.

[06-Mar-19 07:30 AM] ivanovich#3385
thank you!


[06-Mar-19 07:31 AM] ivanovich#3385
how often does they change?


[06-Mar-19 07:36 AM] arweave-lev#3466
We do not plan to change them. It may happen anyways, but in this case we should announce it here on Discord.


[06-Mar-19 07:47 PM] awkweird#6550
But the peers are only used for connecting right?

hey, team.
have some problem with mining
here is some logs https://pastebin.com/zHEqZ9wL


[07-Mar-19 02:32 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@ivanovich you need a random block from the past to mine yet another block. Your node only has 2634 out of 153886 blocks so the chances to start mining are low. Eventually your node will download more blocks and will be always mining.


[07-Mar-19 02:35 AM] ivanovich#3385
but my wallet_lists contains 48Gb with 152865 *.json


[07-Mar-19 02:36 AM] ivanovich#3385
maybe this files haven't loaded yet?


[07-Mar-19 02:36 AM] arweave-lev#3466
The blocks are stored in the `blocks` folder.

is it a good strategy set max_miners=cpu_number or you know some other cheats?
sometimes i see such ERRORS https://pastebin.com/g3DTVAVG


[07-Mar-19 04:26 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I wouldn’t suggest using every single thread you have for max_miners


[07-Mar-19 04:27 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Star with like 3 or 4 less than the total number of threads you have


[07-Mar-19 04:27 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I try to shoot for 85-90% average utilization across the whole server


[07-Mar-19 04:35 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@ivanovich have you ever removed anything from the `txs` folder?


[07-Mar-19 04:36 AM] ivanovich#3385
no, 606 files are there

do you by chance see `not_enough_space_to_write_tx` in your logs? you can check recent logs by running `make catlog` in the `arweave` folder


[07-Mar-19 05:30 AM] ivanovich#3385
grep doesn't find any *space*  in logs


[07-Mar-19 05:38 AM] arweave-lev#3466
can you please grep the whole `logs` folder?


[07-Mar-19 05:40 AM] ivanovich#3385
done. same result


[07-Mar-19 05:52 AM] arweave-lev#3466
so, your node should be still operational but it would be nice to figure out what causes those logs; it's not clear to me yet; I think, the #mining-economics channel does not fit for that, do you mind continuing in the personal chat?

[15-Mar-19 01:53 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-martin @arweave-india @arweave-lev @arweave-stan So, there is a very interesting question.
To start introductory:
There are 6 groups of dedicated servers (not VPS), on which Arweave mining was launched at different times. The number of servers in each group is the same.
1 group started the very first 2 months ago, 6 group started a few days ago.
On all servers, the blocks and transactions was updated, currently the volume of the arweave folder is 54373 MB on each server.
Servers are absolutely identical, groups 4-6 have never even been in operation.
On all servers almost simultaneously similar entries appear in the log:
Friday, 06:22:11: [Stage 1/3] Successfully proved access to recall block. Starting to hash.
and it basically says that the probability of block extraction is the same on all servers (correct me if I'm wrong), and the size of the folder with the blocks is the same everywhere, the value of "height" and "blocks" are about the same on all servers. Servers are rebooted at the same time, if necessary, and mining is simultaneously launched on them. There are no downtime in mining, the average CPU load is about the same for each server.
The number of rewards from the moment of full synchronization of servers from 4-6 groups for a rather long period is uneven (although over a large period it should be approximately the same):
Group_1 = 9 blocks
Group_2 = 13 blocks
Group_3 = 9 blocks
Group_4 = 3 blocks
Group_5 = 2 blocks
Group_6 = 3 blocks

Actually the question:
How is the reward accrued, if the differences are only in the time of the total mining of each server? For some reason, in two absolutely identical server groups, the number of found blocks may differ by 4-6 times? Does the number of rewards depend on the total time of the server as a miner?
P.S.:I repeat, all servers are exactly the same.


[15-Mar-19 02:45 AM] tiamat#9131
so hardware, network link and settings are the same for group_2 and group_5 ?


[15-Mar-19 03:17 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@tiamat For each server. They are even in the same room and connected to the same switch.


[15-Mar-19 05:09 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@slayer_hellraiser Thank you for sharing! The number of found blocks in your stats are very low, so you cannot draw much conclusions of your data. If Group_2 would have found 1300 blocks and Group_5 would have found 200 blocks, then it would look weird to me. Please keep us posted if you keep updating the stats!


[15-Mar-19 05:17 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-martin Hm The question is that I have such statistics for at least 10 days after starting the servers of groups 4-6. The specified number of blocks only displays the proportions between the groups. I can say the following: when I added groups 4-6, I began to mined only 15% more blocks per day.


[15-Mar-19 05:18 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Repeat the main question: Does the number of rewards depend on the total time of the server as a miner or not?


[15-Mar-19 05:21 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-martin Understand, I would not like to give exact numbers


[15-Mar-19 05:22 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
but group 2 produced 6 times more than group 5


[15-Mar-19 05:25 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
production in each of the groups was uniform and was not interrupted


[15-Mar-19 05:27 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@slayer_hellraiser Since the numbers of rewards your miners got are so low, you cannot really compare them. If I launched a miner now, I might mine a block after 10 seconds. That doesn't mean my machine will average on producing 360 blocks per hour. And for the inverse, if my miner has been running for a 3 hours without mining a block, then it doesn't mean it will never mine a block.


[15-Mar-19 05:27 AM] arweave-martin#1169
You need a higher sample size to be able to draw conclusions when there is so much randomness involved..


[15-Mar-19 05:27 AM] arweave-martin#1169
2 is a very low sample size.


[15-Mar-19 05:28 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
My friend has the same situation: the early running servers show a large daily ar amount.


[15-Mar-19 05:28 AM] arweave-martin#1169
Actually, it the second lowest sample size there is  


[15-Mar-19 05:30 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@slayer_hellraiser You can compare your logfiles with your friend. Count the number of times it starts to mine (or fails to start mining) during the same period.


[15-Mar-19 05:32 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-martin The number of awards he also decreased judging by the logs.


[15-Mar-19 05:35 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-martin According to my servers, I judge about the interval of 10 days and the total production of 600 blocks. In group 2 - 196 blocks, in group 5 - 32 blocks in 10 days


[15-Mar-19 05:36 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Well, proportionally in other groups, I previously wrote that the number of blocks I specified in the first message is only a proportion


[15-Mar-19 05:37 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
That is, you do not know for sure whether the daily mining performance depends on the total time of the server as a miner?


[15-Mar-19 05:39 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@slayer_hellraiser I don't really understand. Did Group_2 get 196 rewards in the same period Group_5 only got 32 rewards?


[15-Mar-19 05:41 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-martin YES


[15-Mar-19 05:42 AM] arweave-martin#1169
Did they start mine or failed to start mine the same amount of times during this period?


[15-Mar-19 05:43 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
And these server groups differ only in that Group_2 was launched in early January, and the Group_5 10 days ago. And it is from the moment of launch of Group_5 that I observe such an anomaly. Groups 1 and 3 can be disregarded, other projects are also running on them, so their performance is slightly lower.


[15-Mar-19 05:44 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-martin Did not understand you a little


[15-Mar-19 05:45 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
There were no errors in the logs, nothing. But the number of Stage 3 in the logs is about 6 times less in the fifth group, compared with the second group


[15-Mar-19 06:04 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@slayer_hellraiser How about the number of "Stage 2" entries in the logs? About the same as the number of "Stage 3"?


[15-Mar-19 06:07 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-martin Slightly more than Stage 3, about 5 percent


[15-Mar-19 06:07 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
For every 100 Stage 3 entries, there are approximately 105 Stage 2 entries.


[15-Mar-19 06:08 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
And this ratio is about the same in all groups, that is, in groups of 4-6, the percentage of rejected blocks is no higher.


[15-Mar-19 06:13 AM] arweave-martin#1169
Sounds healthy. How about the number of "Stage 1" entries compared between the different groups?


[15-Mar-19 06:14 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-martin Above I wrote about this:
||On all servers almost simultaneously similar entries appear in the log:
Friday, 06:22:11: [Stage 1/3] Successfully proved access to recall block. Starting to hash.
and it basically says that the probability of block extraction is the same on all servers (correct me if I'm wrong), and the size of the folder with the blocks is the same everywhere, the value of "height" and "blocks" are about the same on all servers.||


[15-Mar-19 06:15 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
I do not know How to make a quote here..


[15-Mar-19 06:16 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
550-553 records from last miner restart


[15-Mar-19 06:16 AM] arweave-martin#1169
But how about the number of those "Stage 1" log messages? Are they the same between the groups?


[15-Mar-19 06:18 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-martin 550-553 records from last miner restart for each server. The difference may be due to the fact that some servers joined the network a little later after the restart, but here the error is within one percent, even less


[15-Mar-19 06:18 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
I restarted all of my servers approx a day ago


[15-Mar-19 06:25 AM] arweave-martin#1169
Sounds like all your groups start mining the same amount times during the same period, but one group manages to produce 6 times more blocks. That's interesting. How do they perform when running `./arweave-server benchmark`?


[15-Mar-19 06:27 AM] arweave-martin#1169
Our benchmark tool is very artificial, but I've been working on a better one which is mining blocks more like when mining for real. It will use the real mining code which is launching multiple processes according to max_miners.


[15-Mar-19 06:27 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-martin I can do this for you. Need to stop mining?


[15-Mar-19 06:28 AM] arweave-martin#1169
Yes, you should stop mining before running `./arweave-server benchmark`


[15-Mar-19 06:28 AM] arweave-martin#1169
Don't restart the whole server though, in case it's a virtual server and it will launch on different hardware.


[15-Mar-19 06:29 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-martin I wrote earlier that all servers are dedicated, not VPS.


[15-Mar-19 06:30 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
How long does the test take?


[15-Mar-19 06:30 AM] arweave-martin#1169
It never finishes


[15-Mar-19 06:31 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
How do I know the result of the test, if it never stops?


[15-Mar-19 06:33 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Can I run the test just for a minute, for example?


[15-Mar-19 06:38 AM] arweave-martin#1169
If it outputs a fairly consistent number, then you should be happy with the number.


[15-Mar-19 06:41 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-martin I want to run it simultaneously on all servers, and if there are a lot of them, it is not very convenient to do it consistently. But I found a way. In 10 minutes, I will tell you the result.


[15-Mar-19 06:48 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-martin Average performance on servers 2, 4, 5 and 6 groups -1920815h/s/core, 1 and 3 groups -1688618h/s/core. 8 HT cores per each server. Groups 1 and 3 can be disregarded, other projects are also running on them, so their performance is slightly lower.


[15-Mar-19 06:51 AM] arweave-martin#1169
There is no huge difference, so it looks good.


[15-Mar-19 06:54 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-martin In general, it turns out that servers with higher benchmark performance (about 20 percent approximately) mined 6 times slower


[15-Mar-19 06:55 AM] arweave-martin#1169
So there is a correlation after all. That's interresting!


[15-Mar-19 06:55 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
And I really don't understand what the problem is. The difference is only in the time of the first launch of mining on servers in different groups...


[15-Mar-19 06:56 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-martin yes, there is a correlation


[15-Mar-19 06:57 AM] arweave-martin#1169
I would like to run the improved benchmark on your machines. Let me finish the improved benchmark tool and I will get back to you.


[15-Mar-19 06:58 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-martin of course. PM me

I’ve been trying to figure out similar metrics as @slayer_hellraiser I have on prem and cloud miners that all seem to have wildly different results. Can’t wait to hear your conclusions.


[15-Mar-19 08:00 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I think having more servers local to one another has something to do with it right? The longer your group is on the higher the wildfire score would be to your other nodes.


[15-Mar-19 08:00 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Restarting your miner deletes your wildfire scores of other miners


[15-Mar-19 08:04 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Here a little about that.@Vilenarios


[15-Mar-19 08:05 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
I restart the miner as soon as the need arises. And the last time I restarted it was 10 days ago (well, today, after the benchmark)


[15-Mar-19 08:13 AM] arweave-lev#3466
> The longer your group is on the higher the wildfire score would be to your other nodes.

This might indeed matter.


[15-Mar-19 08:24 AM] Vilenarios#8742
How many confirmations are needed for a new block?


[15-Mar-19 08:25 AM] Vilenarios#8742
10 right?


[15-Mar-19 08:41 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-lev
>This might indeed matter.
but if my servers are all restarting at the same time, does it matter?


[15-Mar-19 08:43 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@slayer_hellraiser no, then not. It might just explain some differences between the new miners and those that have been running for some time.


[15-Mar-19 08:45 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-lev That is?


[15-Mar-19 08:51 AM] arweave-lev#3466
Nodes which maintain good connections with other peers gain a better Wildfire score, as a result they learn about new blocks faster and mine more efficiently.


[15-Mar-19 08:55 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-lev Ok, and how to find out this figure? And I think that my servers at least know everything about each other if they are almost next door. on each of them gigabit connection. The largest part in Canada, part in France, did speed testing - there is almost one gigabit between locations.


[15-Mar-19 09:46 AM] Vilenarios#8742
So if you have 20 servers in the same data center and keep them all on for a while and don’t stop/start all at the same time, you will generate awesome wildfire scores for yourself


[15-Mar-19 09:47 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Which then allows you to get those hot streaks we sometimes see miners get


[15-Mar-19 09:54 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@slayer_hellraiser could you check what is the biggest time difference between receiving `accepted_foreign_block:  <<some-block>>` on any two nodes for some blocks in the past?


[15-Mar-19 10:24 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-lev 1-2 seconds, but it can be at the level of error of the internal server clock


[15-Mar-19 10:25 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@Vilenarios 
>So if you have 20 servers in the same data center and keep them all on for a while and don’t stop/start all at the same time, you will generate awesome wildfire scores for yourself
>Which then allows you to get those hot streaks we sometimes see miners get
Can you tell us more about this?


[15-Mar-19 10:26 AM] Vilenarios#8742
It’s just a theory of mine. I haven’t proven it


[15-Mar-19 10:26 AM] Vilenarios#8742
But you see hot streaks on miners who get multiple blocks in a row. . I haven’t looked in a while though.


[15-Mar-19 10:27 AM] Vilenarios#8742
But idk in theory I think you should be able to game the wildfire score by hosting a lot of miners. I’d love to hear what the team thinks.


[15-Mar-19 10:27 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Not saying it’s cost effective to run that many miners though...


[15-Mar-19 10:27 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@Vilenarios And, like I heard it with reference to arweave and maybe even from you


[15-Mar-19 10:29 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
With regards to me, I found a way to manage a virtually unlimited number of servers. I have about a thousand masternodes for several projects.


[15-Mar-19 10:51 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Of course. Cloud is powerful   depending on your budget.


[15-Mar-19 11:12 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@Vilenarios No, I do not control it from the cloud. I have my own toolkit, equally suitable for VPS and for dedicated servers (the main thing is that there is SSH)))


[15-Mar-19 11:13 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
And it's free (open source, of course)

I'm lagging a fixed amount behind : {"network":"arweave.N.1","version":5,"release":21,"height":171015,"current":"zzdKVhwjlwDGNnLuSUGwU3FWbEKYuI3AyGPS6eKsa-rTjHCU2PMgz8HQVAGpAnSR","blocks":171103,"peers":206,"queue_length":0,"node_state_latency":34} this is approximately 80-90 blocks...  its been like this now for more than a day...

@Deleted User I think is better you ask on our #mining channel on Dev talk server, as you'll be able to meet more miners over their. 

You can join the dev talk server with the link. https://discord.gg/NcTUQt

how will mining reward decrease over time ? is there a source i can read about this?


[10-May-19 03:11 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@aurora The reward decreases smoothly in every block, from 5.5mAR in total in the first year, 2.75mAR in the second, etc


[10-May-19 03:12 PM] arweave-stan#3973
In total 11mAR will be printed


[10-May-19 05:51 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Hey Stan are tokens ever burned or locked for any reason?


[10-May-19 06:45 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@Vilenarios no, we do not have a token burn model, the only way tokens can be permanently locked is by user loosing access to the wallet or sending to a wrong address. Thanks


[11-May-19 01:11 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan What is a Max Circulating Supply with these printed 11 M AR?


[11-May-19 01:44 AM] ivhturp#3325
@slayer_hellraiser 66M AR


[11-May-19 02:26 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@ivhturp is correct, 66m token for total supply. 11m for mining and 55m from the genesis block.   @slayer_hellraiser

What is the total hashpower of the network?


[13-May-19 03:15 AM] arweave-stan#3973
https://viewblock.io/arweave


[13-May-19 05:37 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan No hashpowerr on this site. Only difficulty


[13-May-19 05:37 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Where is i can find a hashrate (hashpower)?


[13-May-19 06:01 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@slayer_hellraiser You can calculate the hashpower by taking 2 to the power of difficulty and divide it by two. E.g. difficulty 40 is 550GH/s


[13-May-19 06:03 AM] arweave-martin#1169
But the difficultly currently changes between 39 and 41, so the hashing power is somewhere in between, i.e somewhere between 275GH/s and 1100GH/s.


[13-May-19 06:05 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@arweave-martin thanks 


[13-May-19 09:38 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-martin Well, it would be nice if it could be seen without these tricks, of course.

[14-May-19 01:27 AM] rehash#3438
What you compare with? Arweave hashing 384 is quite unique in the space.


[14-May-19 02:41 AM] ivhturp#3325
@Rabbi Considering my 36C node has a benchmark of 10Mhz, 500 GH looks quite decent


[14-May-19 02:43 AM] ATLAS#7218
The issue is with the txs. You can't send 2 txs at the same time even if it is legit because confirmation depends on your last tx.


[14-May-19 02:44 AM] ATLAS#7218
And block time is ~6min. So 1 address can send 1 tx in 6 minute.


[14-May-19 02:50 AM] rehash#3438
@ivhturp I strongly believe the hashpower is more than what benchmark tool is saying, the old version /core was actually more accurate


[14-May-19 02:51 AM] rehash#3438
it depends on the architecture of your 32C, but unless they are atoms or capped it should be more than 10Mhz


[14-May-19 03:51 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@rehash the new benchmark tool runs the actual mining code. Therefore it should estimate the actual performance more accurately.


[14-May-19 09:04 PM] ivhturp#3325
@arweave-lev If i compare benchmark with total network hash, node has a probability of 0.00002 to mine a block or approx 0.01 to mine a block in a day.  But it mines atleast a block every other day


[14-May-19 09:04 PM] ivhturp#3325
*calculates are estimates


[15-May-19 01:02 AM] rehash#3438
@ivhturp your hashpower is higher than what benchmark is giving, I'd estimate your 32C at 48 MH/s, again depends on architecture

{Reactions}
  

[15-May-19 01:15 AM] ivhturp#3325
Even with 48MH/s, probability still doesnt work out @rehash

I did this earlier with the double ctrl+c and it started over


[27-May-19 02:05 AM] arweave-lev#3466
Double ctrl+c and then start over is fine.

There is no way to sync up faster but as soon as you have all the blocks on the first machine, you can bootstrap other nodes faster by copying the data over to them, check this section of the guide - https://docs.arweave.org/info/mining/mining-guide#bootstrap-the-second-miner-faster

@arweave-lev thanks for the reply.  But when I say start over I mean it starts syncing from zero.  Is there any way to prevent this since it'll take a week to sync?  If I lose power to my machine I'll be syncing for another week


[27-May-19 10:42 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@crunchycat no it does not start from zero, it continues to download the blocks it does not have yet. You can see the total number of downloaded blocks under "blocks" if you browse to [YOUR_IP]:1984, it should eventually catch up with "height".


[27-May-19 10:48 AM] crunchycat#0726
hmm okay, must've been an isolated incident since it did start from square one. Lost a day of sync.  I'll let you know if it happens again.  ty

My biggest question is how you're going to deal with legal issues that will eventually arrise with the permaweb? What if people don't want a website archived?


[04-Feb-19 07:08 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@Mazzz network participants have a possibility to reject content they do not want to store. The more miners reject a chunk of illicit data, the smaller is the probability to find it on the weave. Some technical details are described in the light paper. We are working on improving the related tools and policies.

Is there a way that Arweave detects duplicate files on the network?


[19-Feb-19 05:33 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@DesignBlock please I'll confirm and get back to you, but please always do use the appropriate channel for your questions, this question is best to be asked on #stored-on-the-arweave  channel. Thanks for your support and understanding :)


[20-Feb-19 03:34 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@DesignBlock just so I confirm, Arweave network do not detect duplicate files on the network....But we have a very strong policy of voluntarism on the part of the miners that creates a system for democratised content rejection -- no miner can be forced to store any content that they dislike.

Broadly, miners can maintain a lists of content (by hash and by keyword) that they will not accept in blocks - this lets them filter bad content or duplicate files without storing it themselves. The net effect of this is that even miners that don't blacklist themselves don't want to accept transactions containing content that they think will be widely rejected by other miners; if they mine these transactions into their block then there is a high likelihood that this block won't be accepted into the network, and that they will not receive their mining reward.

This system works for content that the network strongly agrees is bad, and stops it getting on to the chain in the first place, but it's obviously not possible to prevent all the content that might upset anybody being placed on the chain. However, to address this, there is also a system that allows users to post "don't serve this" transactions onto the network. These transactions post a hash of the transaction that the user doesn't want served, and lets miners make the choice about whether to serve these transactions or not.

Finally, just to specifically address any concern about your own hard drive: because the chain shards and nobody is obligated to store any content they don't wish to, if you don't like the content of a block, you can simply drop it.

How much AR does it cost to store data on arweave?


[10-Apr-19 12:31 AM] ivhturp#3325
Forwarding message of stan: Regarding the storage cost. You can ask the network for the current price to store a certain amount of data. So for 1MB (1048576 bytes) the current cost is found here: http://arweave.net/price/1048576


[10-Apr-19 12:52 AM] Marcin#0065
1 MB price around 0,1AR now.
10MB cost around x60 more (6AR)

depends how large the files are. its always better to split big files innto small pieces.


[10-Apr-19 01:30 AM] arweave-stan#3973
Yh,  @ivhturp is correct,  @Lucifer1903 the price is in Windston, so you should divide it with 1000000000000 to get the number of AR.


[10-Apr-19 10:21 AM] Vilenarios#8742
So .1 AR at 20 cents is 2 cents for 1mb. 20 cents for 10 mB. 1 dollar for 50 MB. 10 dollars for 500mb. 20 dollars per GB. 20,000 dollars per TB.


[10-Apr-19 10:22 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I can’t tell if that’s cheap or expensive for permanent storage.


[10-Apr-19 11:03 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Vilenarios Please do bear in mind that the price can fluctuate depending on the availability of storage in our network. Also, another thing good to know is that the price per MB goes up with the size. So storing one 1000MB file is much higher than splitting it up into 1000 chunks of 1MB.


[10-Apr-19 12:06 PM] Marcin#0065
20k usd for a TB.... wow... it's like 1995.

@arweave-stan does the team know how much storage is available on the network?


[10-Apr-19 02:11 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I’d bet most miners have minimal amount of storage especially in the cloud... maybe a fire have larger amounts. But I’d be curious to see total amount of storage the miners could handle right now.


[10-Apr-19 03:00 PM] rehash#3438
clouders are definitely on the edge, I have like 4TB on some of my servers


[10-Apr-19 05:48 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Why you paying for 4TB tho...


[10-Apr-19 05:51 PM] Vilenarios#8742
But ya cloud nodes can definitely scale faster.


[15-Apr-19 04:21 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Vilenarios regarding your question about how much storage available on the network. 

The exact data storage quantity is unknown because we use a system of incentives rather than contracts, but we recently calculated that mining would currently be profitable up to approximately 1.4 exabytes of data storage.


[15-Apr-19 04:54 AM] Mazzz#1871
@arweave-stan that's a lotta data, but it's still not infinitely scalable. What happens after 1.4 exabytes have been stored?


[15-Apr-19 05:07 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Mazzz That is just the current maximum. By the time we get near that, it will have increased. If the storage capacity of the network has not increased, the price for adding data will increase as the limit is neared. The increase in data storage price will either cause:
A. More miners to come to the network, bringing more storage capacity, as the profitability increases.
B. Fewer people to store data, as the price increases.


[15-Apr-19 05:08 AM] arweave-stan#3973
This keeps the size of the network within reasonable bounds


[13-May-19 04:27 AM] digamma889#3785

@digamma889 Yup DNS integration  is in the works -- as we're natively HTTP based it's also possible to use cloudflare workers and other similar systems to put a custom domain in front of arweave.net today

[24-Jan-19 04:17 PM] Alexander#7837
so why the need of second discord? just because people asked about exchanges and “fudded”? you think it wont happen here or dante will ban them like he did on tg?


[25-Jan-19 12:51 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Alexander no, we didn't move to discuss because people fudded and ask about exchange, we moved to discord because we feel like it has more features which allows different areas for different topics, this will also help the conversation no to get split as everyone is trying to talk in different topics in a big chat room with only one feature. I hope my explanation helps?

The truth is, you almost never find something constructive on Telegram. Without ICOs there are not many reasons for crypto world to continue with Telegram.

@soulworksuk I disagree with you, I've explained to you the reason for discord group, anyone who care about the project, won't get hold if the chat group is on Telegram or discord, they should join any channel and the bone of contention should be the "communication". And I believe discord is best place to have a healthy communication, because of its features for different topics.


[25-Jan-19 03:31 AM] soulworksuk#7150
Dantes, I agree about the functionality of discord. But there is hardly anyone here


[25-Jan-19 03:32 AM] soulworksuk#7150
It doesn't matter if the platform is better if no one from the community is here.


[25-Jan-19 04:26 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@soulworksuk like I said before, if someone care about the project, the platform where the conversation or communication is being done is not an issue, I've seen some projects that doesn't use either telegram or discord, but they have their own chatroom on their website, yet members do sign up and join.  I think the team even cared more about the community by moving to the discord where discussions won't get fragmented and anyone can join the channel where it suits their topic of discussion.

[25-Jan-19 05:47 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@Bicepsueel bringing it to discord doesn't stop people from knowing about the project, either leaving it on telegram makes people to know about the project more, I guess proper marketing is what will make people to know about the project,which is also in the team's pipeline.

The team hopefully ramp up marketing at some point. You think an investor or developer will be like “omg they don’t use TG I’m moving on!”


[25-Jan-19 09:35 PM] Vilenarios#8742
They may move on for other reasons... but chat functionality prolly won’t be one of them.


[25-Jan-19 09:36 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Maybe I’m just naive though.


[26-Jan-19 01:21 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Vilenarios you're right, I don't agree you're naïve. Chat is chat honestly, but I think discord has better features, now everyone can focus on the topic they want to discuss. And I believe the team's decision to move over discord is because of the project's long term. Thank you guys for your support :)


[26-Jan-19 02:00 AM] Alexander#7837
but this is arweaves second discord.. you close telegram then you set up second discord channel? while the first one is still kinda active? rename it to devs channel.. sigh.. its not like arwrave has thousands of followers yet here we are with closing tg groups and setting up second discord group


[26-Jan-19 03:48 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Alexander please we have two discord servers, this is for general Arweave discussion such as use cases, archiving, exchange talk, price discussion, economics chat, etc. While the other server is for devs talk such as technical support, mining implementation, dapp development/integration. Thanks for your support and enthusiasm :)

@MD5679  we didn't close the telegram group, to move to discord, to stop answering people's questions, we moved to discord because we feel like it has more features which allows different areas for different topics, this will also help the conversation no to get split as everyone is trying to talk in different topics in a big chat room with only one feature.

Not many people use discord, majority of people are in telegram .. I don't understand how more features of discord will help in growing the community when you are leaving majority of the community behind


[30-Jan-19 10:17 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@MD5679 anyone who care about the project, won't get hold if the chat group is on Telegram or discord, they should join any channel and the bone of contention should be the "communication". And I believe discord is best place to have a healthy communication, because of its features for different topics.


[30-Jan-19 10:18 AM] arweave-stan#3973
Besides, or doesn't take up to 2 minutes to set up discord account


[30-Jan-19 10:20 AM] MD5679#5221
It's not about who cares about the project or it takes a minute to setup discord account it's the team's responsibility to make the community more accessible not the other way around


[30-Jan-19 10:39 AM] arweave-stan#3973
We're still saying the same thing, the team are planning for the long term of the project, and thought discord is the best place for this because of its features. And I know discord is very easy to access by anyone.


[30-Jan-19 02:43 PM] soulworksuk#7150
The numbers don't add up dantes. There is less than 100 people here now. On telegram there were 16000. Unfortunately you have left the community behind whether you like it or not  


[30-Jan-19 03:15 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@soulworksuk true, but also remember the telegram group has stayed up to 2yrs, but the discord is just few days which I believe as time goes on, it will grow too. So don't expect the discord to have the same number with telegram group that has been in existence for long. Every decision taken by the team is for the long term of the project. Thanks for your understanding

[11-Feb-19 01:22 AM] Mazzz#1871
@Marcin No, someone just went to tokens.arweave.org, created a bunch of GitHub accounts and siphoned tokens


[11-Feb-19 01:22 AM] Mazzz#1871
I think the team has disabled getting 5 free tokens from GitHub account for that reason


[11-Feb-19 06:08 AM] Vilenarios#8742

[11-Feb-19 07:33 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Only clever if he did it all automatically. Would be quite sad if he sat there all day and generated new GitHub and emails manually and manually sent all transactions to a single address


[11-Feb-19 07:48 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@Vilenarios Do you think that this multiaccounter decided to get airdrop? It would be strange to do manually 


[11-Feb-19 07:51 AM] Vilenarios#8742
The team should maybe have to approve each request for airdropped tokens and the request should include a justification


[11-Feb-19 07:51 AM] Vilenarios#8742
So at least it would force the person to do it manually.


[11-Feb-19 07:51 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I’m not sure how else to police giving out free money essentially. This is the problem with all airdrops I imagine.


[11-Feb-19 08:02 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hi guys  - yep looks like they tried to switch to manually claiming the wallets, but we'll be looking into a solution to try and resolve this to make sure we can still offer a small amount of tokens to those acting in good faith.

@chriscord please I'll get back to you. Thanks


[02-Mar-19 06:06 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@chriscord we are paying for the uploads from the adoption incentive pool for the first full batch. Tokens from the uploads end up in the hands of the miners, via the transaction reward pool mechanism.

The number of tokens involved is actually very small as we are only archiving the text for now.


[05-Mar-19 05:02 AM] ivhturp#3325
Can we delete the files once uploaded?


[05-Mar-19 05:12 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@ivhturp I don't think it would be possible to 'delete' files as the underlying structure of the weave is truly designed for absolute permanence..


[05-Mar-19 06:19 AM] ivhturp#3325
If anyone uploads a file by mistake, is it not possible to undo it   This feature may be required for general users AFAIK


[05-Mar-19 06:26 AM] tiamat#9131
@ivhturp can you undo if you send 100 ETH to someone by mistake?


[05-Mar-19 06:28 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@ivhturp This is certainly something I've as well thought about, but it wouldn't be possible to 'undo' files as I already said the underlying structure of the weave is truly designed for absolute permanence, and 'undoing' would require deleting the  previous file version which is not possible. However, there could perhaps be an app built ontop of the blockweave that handles uploading only the differences between the existing document and the updated document, which would cost less AR than uploading a brand new document. But this isn't something we currently have in our plans at the moment as a team. Community developers are very welcome though, and we'll help people out with developing on the weave as much as possible!

[05-Mar-19 07:09 AM] ivhturp#3325
@tiamat I understand uploading the files is like a transaction here. However, when you consider a traditional storage solution, it is a basic feature. If you expect wider audience to adapt, they will notice this upfront. I am just exploring if it can be worked out on Arweave.

I have to agree with Baz....we supported you guys when you needed and we don't get any support from you....what we got are utility tokens which can be used inside your product or sold on exchange if we don't find your product suitable for us....so please do something for the community and get on some exchange!!!

@ATLAS I have a suspicion that it is convenient for them. Even such an old project as Pindify (Pindex) and that has long been listed on exchange, although the admins in the TG group, in principle, denied any listing. It even took them less than a year to get into the listing.
P.S.: their ICO lasted 3 months and they didn’t collect the Hard Cap.
P.P.S.: Pindex generally banned all for questions about the exchange after a couple of warnings.  And then they was listed on Huobi

Really annoying


[01-May-19 10:11 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@slayer_hellraiser please let's keep it Arweave related discussion.


[01-May-19 10:13 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan We can not continue to discuss what does not develop, admins of which put likes on their records and something that will never be listed on any exchanger


[01-May-19 10:14 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@slayer_hellraiser we can discuss everything about Arweave, but we shouldn't discussion anything outside Arweave, such as other projects. Thanks for your understanding.


[01-May-19 10:15 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan Ok.
- What about exchange for arweave?
- We can't discussion about it...


[01-May-19 10:17 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@slayer_hellraiser we can discuss about exchange, but I'm unable to comment about exchange publicly, unfortunately.


[01-May-19 10:19 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan What else to talk to us when you ban almost all possible topics. But no, I know one topic who is exactly allowed: we need to sing the praises of the project and praise it in every way... With such an attitude to your community, you will never wait for it, do you hear? NEVER.


[01-May-19 10:21 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
And about Pindex:
This was also "only a utility token", like arweave


[01-May-19 10:22 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
But they took themselves in hand and listed to Huobi


[01-May-19 10:22 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@slayer_hellraiser please I didn't ban anything related to Arweave, everyone is free to discuss about Arweave and all the related topics about Arweave project. So please don't misunderstand me.  Thanks


[01-May-19 10:25 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan Understand that it is impossible to discuss something when 99.9999999% of topics are forbidden for discussion. Why do you think this Discord server is so quiet, unlike servers of other projects? Yes, all because there is not allowed to communicate.


[01-May-19 10:29 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
You can log in to the Solo Discord server (another coin that is mined only on CPU). There are few times fewer people on that server, but imagine, there is a communication, and yes, including not strictly about the project itself.


[01-May-19 10:41 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@slayer_hellraiser please I disagree with you about our discord server being silent, do bear in mind that we have two discord servers. The Arweave Dev talk is always active.


[01-May-19 11:17 AM] vveljk#9869
Can we talk about why you don't want to list AR on some exchange? And answer like "we are trying to do our best" is out of option, because there are exchanges that would list you right away.


[01-May-19 11:20 AM] vveljk#9869
I am not asking on which exchange and when and anything that would in any way manipulate the price...actually the price can not even be manipulated since there is no price for AR token that could be manipulated...just a simple question and that is why is Arweave team holding listing on some exchange?


[01-May-19 11:22 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@vveljk I'm sorry, but the answer still remain the same, till we have an update. We're unable to comment about exchange publicly, we'll announce about exchange when we. Please do bear with us. Thanks


[01-May-19 11:24 AM] vveljk#9869

[01-May-19 11:48 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
I actually much more liked the format of communication in the telegraph, until there they banned any questions at all.
Why do you now have two announcement channels in the telegram?
One as a channel for anouncement and the other as a group (for forward posts from anouncement channel), messages in which are only from admins, other messages are erased almost immediately ..


[01-May-19 11:50 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
This question is not prohibited? Or will it not have an answer?


[01-May-19 11:54 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@slayer_hellraiser please like I said before, we have moved from telegram to discord and we’re only on discord, as discord's multi-channel feature allows for different areas for different topics of discussion. This allows for focused conversations without conversations getting fragmented and everyone needing to talk over each other in one big group, which could cause some meaningful conversations to get lost and confused. Anyone can follow conversations they are interested in, and ignore topics they wish to. Thanks❤️


[01-May-19 12:06 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan
I repeat my questions:

[01-May-19 12:23 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@slayer_hellraiser yh, in as much as we have moved to discord server, we still forward our post in our telegram announcement channel because of those who have not joined the discord, regarding messages getting erased, the telegram chat group has been muted, so anyone who post on it, the post will automatically get deleted. Thanks


[01-May-19 12:41 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan Well, back to the question: it turns out that you have two channels for announcements in telegrams. What are they for?


[01-May-19 12:45 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@slayer_hellraiser I've answered you the question, telegram channel and the chat group were formally official Arweave channel and chat group. So we still post there because of the community members who have not joined the discord, and please do bear in mind that not all people that are in the announcement channel, are also in the chat group and vise versa, so posting in both will help anyone who hasn't joined the discord not to miss any update.   


[01-May-19 01:44 PM] vveljk#9869
@arweave-stan Nice that you are always staying like professional with your answers and not banning us or deleting chat, but Stan we feel that arweave is only protecting their own interests and most probably private investors interests....it really sucks to see that the rest of us were there just to fill the gap you had or so you reached your commercial mass which is obviously not going in the right direction. We are kindly asking arweave to list AR on some exchange. The only thing you get from not getting listed is some sad or angry people...also the price of arweave is going to be affected by community and arweave's success stories and by being massively adopted because you offer something that people need and not because of some small number of people that will most probably immediately sell their tokens. So please listen to the community and try to understand us and do that small thing we ask you for. Thank you.


[01-May-19 02:16 PM] vveljk#9869
@arweave-stan Since we should not mention here other brand where can I write you about one company that is developing nice environment for application developers and I am sure your way of storage could be of their interest. I already mentioned them about your product and they said that they will check it. Maybe you are already in contact with them, but if not I am sure that you have something for them. The could include your service in their SDK's.


[01-May-19 02:46 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@vveljk thanks for your comment, please I didn't completely disapprove mentioning another brand, we only disapprove any brand that has nothing to do with Arweave.  Like I said before, I said we allow suggestions/comments that will be of value to Arweave project and it's ecosystem. So if the brand you want suggest to us will be of good to us, please feel free to suggest and our team will take note of it. We appreciate your support :)

@arweave-stan No, unfortuanely I cant do your Job and answer this question. The thing is - I dont need to answer this question - but you do. You need to serve and provide. I just assume, that you dont have any kind of plans to hit any exchange in the near future and thus ignoring these kind of questions and giving stupid answers like timezones etc... this is just waste of time.

Is there an app which is able to convert big files into pieces and then upload it in the weave and provides you will all needed links to gather all pieces together back again?


[17-Apr-19 04:31 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Marcin I don't have information on how much the whole wikileaks is at the moment, but if you know the size, you can check how much it will cost to store it on the Arweave.  There is a HTTP endpoint giving estimations: /price/<size-in-bytes>. It responds with a price in Winston so divide by 1000000000000.


[17-Apr-19 05:21 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@Marcin we have a prototype that can take your file, and upload it in chunks. Then it can take  a TX ID and recollect the chunks back into a file. Unfortunately, there are a couple of known issues making it not very easy to use (it does not properly account for forks so it may upload with holes and it does not tell you when the upload is finished so you should check logs every once in a while to pick TX IDs and see if it downloads the original file back).

Thanks  @arweave-lev   


[17-Apr-19 05:53 AM] Marcin#0065
In small steps arweave is evolving. I hope in 5 years it's gonna be a product usable for everyone


[17-Apr-19 06:22 AM] tiamat#9131
it's all about adoption, team itself cannot  do infrastructure+apps+marketing, once more people find out about the project and community grows, cool things will start to pop


[17-Apr-19 07:02 AM] Marcin#0065
I'd like to store some cool Wikileaks article into the weave and spread that in Reddit.


[18-Apr-19 02:46 AM] tiamat#9131
That would be nice @Marcin. The community should be more involved in spreading the word about Arweave, we have such a nice technology but so very few know about it...


[18-Apr-19 02:55 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@tiamat yh, we really appreciate every support from our community, we're glad to have people like you. Thanks :)


[24-Apr-19 05:02 AM] DesignBlock#0184
Is there a limit of single file's size I can upload to Arweave as of now?


[24-Apr-19 05:12 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@DesignBlock there is a 3 MB limit.


[24-Apr-19 05:14 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@arweave-lev thanks for the answer 


[24-Apr-19 05:17 AM] DesignBlock#0184
Got it, what happen if I attempted to upload more than that? If I use the chrome extension, it will not pursue transaction, what is I use another method? does any method do compute the file size first before uploading it to Arweave to avoid errors?


[24-Apr-19 05:34 AM] arweave-lev#3466
Unfortunately, there is no convenient way to do it so far.


[24-Apr-19 06:44 PM] DesignBlock#0184
@arweave-lev actually i know another method, ill try it out and see what happens


[24-Apr-19 06:45 PM] DesignBlock#0184
I know files can be accessed on the weave even without using arweave.net right? How to do that?


[25-Apr-19 03:35 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@DesignBlock arweave.net points to a group of our IP addresses. You can make the same requests to a particular IP, is that what you are looking for?


[25-Jan-19 03:09 PM] iLion#6786
Arweave not wanting users for their chain it seems? After all this time still no single place to buy/sell these tokens. Ridiculous. This is what happens when group of chickens without a head is running around with no vision and direction. Great stuff and very interesting strategy.


[25-Jan-19 03:11 PM] iLion#6786
btw - u don't need the liquidity channel yet... As there is no such thing existing.  


[25-Jan-19 05:51 PM] arweave-stan#3973
#Warning @iLion please be mindful of your words, no one is chicken. Thanks for your understanding.


[26-Jan-19 04:15 PM] DaVinci#0538
Since there is now a channel for this, will the team please post the full tokenomics for all ICO campaigns?


[26-Jan-19 05:04 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@DaVinci Our hard cap is £6.4m, 55m is the total supply from the genesis block, and 38.5% was sold.  11m for mining. The price of our token sale is £0.44 and £0.55 per token for the private and public sale respectively.


[28-Jan-19 05:39 PM] DaVinci#0538
@arweave-stan  would you please break down how many tokens was sold to seed investors, private sale investors, and public sale investors, in each category


[28-Jan-19 05:39 PM] DaVinci#0538
Not total


[29-Jan-19 02:26 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@DaVinci 38.5% of the total amount of tokens sold, £330k GBP for seed, £5.57m GBP for private sale and £500k GBP for public sale and our overall hard cap is £6.4m


[29-Jan-19 05:37 AM] Vilenarios#8742
So the rest of the tokens (61.5%) are all for miners right?


[29-Jan-19 05:46 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Vilenarios 66m token is total supply. 11m mining and 55m for genesis. Then only 38.5% of the 55m of the genesis block was sold.


[29-Jan-19 05:59 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Got it.


[29-Jan-19 06:00 AM] Vilenarios#8742
So the remaining 20.9 million are reserved for the team?


[29-Jan-19 06:19 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Vilenarios Please do know that there's advisory, team, development of Arweave ecosystem, future use of the project allocations. For more details you can drop us an email to team@arweave.org


[29-Jan-19 07:38 AM] DaVinci#0538
@arweave-stan , i asked you to break down the token amounts sold in each sale. How many tokens did seed investors buy for 330k? etc..


[29-Jan-19 08:00 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@DaVinci for further details, you can send us an email to team@arweave.org


[29-Jan-19 10:36 AM] DaVinci#0538
What’s the point of this channel if you are not going to answer my questions about token economics


[29-Jan-19 11:12 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@DaVinci I've provided with you with enough information to answer your question. 

66m token is total supply. 11m mining and 55m for genesis block. Then only 38.5% of the 55m of the genesis block was sold.  £330k GBP for seed, £5.57m GBP for private sale and £500k GBP for public sale and our overall hard cap is £6.4m. if you still need any further clarification, feel free to drop us an email to team@arweave.org. thanks


[29-Jan-19 11:16 AM] DaVinci#0538
No you provided me with the information you wanted to answer. You actually did not answer my questions at all


[29-Jan-19 11:16 AM] DaVinci#0538
I’m asking how many tokens was sold to each round of investors


[29-Jan-19 11:16 AM] DaVinci#0538
Please break it down


[29-Jan-19 11:17 AM] DaVinci#0538
How many tokens did seed receive, how many tokens for private sale, and how many for public


[29-Jan-19 11:21 AM] prk#3209
I think you can easily calculate with the above given datas


[29-Jan-19 11:21 AM] DaVinci#0538
No you can’t


[29-Jan-19 11:21 AM] DaVinci#0538
You don’t know what price seed got


[29-Jan-19 11:21 AM] DaVinci#0538
Or institutional investors


[29-Jan-19 11:21 AM] prk#3209
Btw, how much total tokens are mined till now? @arweave-stan


[29-Jan-19 11:22 AM] prk#3209
@DaVinci ahh right, seed round price was not revealed by them


[29-Jan-19 11:23 AM] DaVinci#0538
Yep. I’ve been trying to get this answer for weeks


[29-Jan-19 11:23 AM] DaVinci#0538
And they refuse to answer.


[29-Jan-19 11:24 AM] prk#3209
Probably it's pretty much lower


[29-Jan-19 11:25 AM] DaVinci#0538
I have a feeling they are hiding this because the seed round got an insane amount of tokens compared to public sale


[29-Jan-19 11:30 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@prk kindly as mining related questions in the #mining-economics channel. But regarding your question, you can send us an email as I don't have the current amount at the moment.


[29-Jan-19 11:30 AM] DaVinci#0538
What about my question? @arweave-stan


[29-Jan-19 11:31 AM] DaVinci#0538
Why am I constantly ignored about this


[29-Jan-19 11:31 AM] DaVinci#0538
I emailed you guys weeks ago and you still refuse to answer this question


[29-Jan-19 11:33 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@DaVinci I've replied to your question and please don't spam the channel with the same question, I never ignored you, if you need further discussion regarding your question, you can drop us an email at team@arweave.org


[29-Jan-19 11:33 AM] DaVinci#0538
I did email


[29-Jan-19 11:33 AM] DaVinci#0538
And you guys refuse to tell me


[29-Jan-19 11:33 AM] DaVinci#0538
Answer my question and I won’t ask anyone


[29-Jan-19 11:40 AM] DaVinci#0538
So if you won’t answer my question by email and you won’t answer it here. How am I suppose to get the answer?


[29-Jan-19 11:40 AM] prk#3209
The seed round price was around 0.04£


[29-Jan-19 11:40 AM] prk#3209
Found it with my math


[29-Jan-19 11:40 AM] DaVinci#0538
How


[29-Jan-19 11:42 AM] prk#3209
Circulating supply is 23million I think. Total tokens sold in private + public sale = 12.6 million


[29-Jan-19 11:42 AM] prk#3209
So around 10 million sold in seed round


[29-Jan-19 11:43 AM] DaVinci#0538
How do you know 12.6m tokens in private+public?


[29-Jan-19 11:43 AM] prk#3209
Math dude 


[29-Jan-19 11:43 AM] prk#3209
Total fund collected in each phase / token price


[29-Jan-19 11:44 AM] DaVinci#0538
I think you have too many variables to set up that equation.


[29-Jan-19 11:45 AM] DaVinci#0538
We don’t know the amount of tokens sold or price of tokens in the strategic round


[29-Jan-19 11:45 AM] prk#3209
Fund collected in private sale = 5.57m
Private sale  price  = 0.44£

So no. of tokens sold in private sale = 5.57m ÷ 0.44


[29-Jan-19 11:45 AM] DaVinci#0538
Thayvfigure isn’t right


[29-Jan-19 11:46 AM] DaVinci#0538
They raised 5.7 between private sale and strategic


[29-Jan-19 11:46 AM] prk#3209
Nope


[29-Jan-19 11:46 AM] DaVinci#0538
Seed - approx. £330k GBP
Strategic - approx. £1mil GBP
Private - approx. £4.7mil GBP
Final sale - approx. £500k GBP


[29-Jan-19 11:46 AM] DaVinci#0538
This is what they said by email


[29-Jan-19 11:47 AM] prk#3209
Ohh


[29-Jan-19 11:47 AM] prk#3209
It was mentioned above as private sale = 5.7m£


[29-Jan-19 11:48 AM] DaVinci#0538
Also in the email they indicated that the private sale was broken into two parts. Institutions and community.


[29-Jan-19 11:48 AM] prk#3209
I calculated on that basis


[29-Jan-19 11:48 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@DaVinci I just confirmed from my colleague, all emails are answered promptly by the team within office hours. So check your inbox very well if you actually emailed us. Thanks


[29-Jan-19 11:51 AM] DaVinci#0538
Ok. I’ll wait longer  for an answer


[29-Jan-19 11:52 AM] prk#3209
@DaVinci the average token sale price in strategic and seed phase in thus 0.03£


[29-Jan-19 11:52 AM] prk#3209
Updated*


[29-Jan-19 11:52 AM] prk#3209
Can't find exact though


[29-Jan-19 11:52 AM] DaVinci#0538
I just wish the team would publish this


[29-Jan-19 11:52 AM] DaVinci#0538
Idk why they wont be transparent about it


[29-Jan-19 11:53 AM] prk#3209
I don't know why you need the perfect exact value. The average value is 0.03£ which is actually like -15X less that public sale price


[29-Jan-19 11:53 AM] prk#3209
😑 😑


[29-Jan-19 11:53 AM] DaVinci#0538
I’m trying to calculate how screwed the ICO investors are


[29-Jan-19 11:54 AM] DaVinci#0538
Because not only did the seed investors get an insane amount of tokens, our tokens are even more diluted from mining


[29-Jan-19 11:55 AM] prk#3209
Seed got more than 90% discount  . RIP to those who are mining now with taking base price as 0.55£ 


[29-Jan-19 11:56 AM] prk#3209
Btw, I liked their product


[29-Jan-19 11:56 AM] prk#3209
Permaweb looks good


[29-Jan-19 12:01 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@DaVinci no one is screwed and please I won't allow you to engage with the channel with unhealthy discussion, if you can't find the reply as you said you emailed us, I would advise you to send us another email. Thanks


[29-Jan-19 12:13 PM] DaVinci#0538
In the email they refused to tell me how many tokens were sold


[29-Jan-19 12:13 PM] DaVinci#0538
And by they, I mean @arweave-sophie


[29-Jan-19 03:16 PM] tiamat#9131
seed was in 2017?


[29-Jan-19 03:17 PM] tiamat#9131
in ETH they said price was comparable to ico

[30-Jan-19 11:20 AM] DaVinci#0538
She says I have to be a confirmed private sale participant to get any info


[30-Jan-19 11:21 AM] DaVinci#0538
Where is the transparency


[30-Jan-19 11:27 AM] DaVinci#0538
All I want to know is how many tokens were distributed to the seed round investors and private sale investors


[30-Jan-19 11:54 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@DaVinci I'm sure you have gotten a reply to your question, please do not spam the channel with the same question. Thanks


[30-Jan-19 11:59 AM] DaVinci#0538
Nobody has answered my question.why would I keep asking if somebody answered


[30-Jan-19 12:00 PM] DaVinci#0538
What is wrong with Arweave. I’ve been asking a direct question for over a week and do not have an answer.


[31-Jan-19 06:51 AM] DaVinci#0538
Hello, try number 87. How many tokens were distributed for the seed round and private sale round, respectively?


[31-Jan-19 07:00 AM] tiamat#9131
@DaVinci you are a couple of months late in doing your homework  


[31-Jan-19 07:45 AM] Rabbi#2072
It would be nice to get an answer for the question though. It is a valid question


[31-Jan-19 07:56 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Rabbi his question has been answered, you can scroll up to see all my replies to the question, my colleague also replied him via email.


[31-Jan-19 08:08 AM] Rabbi#2072
I actually dont see his question being answered


[31-Jan-19 08:09 AM] Rabbi#2072
All i see is you NOT answering his question. It's pretty direct "How many tokens were distributed for the seed round and private sale round, respectively?"


[31-Jan-19 08:09 AM] Rabbi#2072
Would you answer the question now then, because i would like to also know the answer


[31-Jan-19 08:20 AM] arweave-stan#3973
38.5% of the total amount of tokens sold, £330k GBP for seed, £5.57m GBP for private sale and £500k GBP for public sale and our overall hard cap is £6.4m


[31-Jan-19 08:21 AM] arweave-stan#3973
55m is the total supply from the genesis block, 11m for mining. The price of our token sale is £0.44 and £0.55 per token for the private and public sale respectively.

@arweave-sam  for helping with the answer too :)


[31-Jan-19 08:24 AM] arweave-sam#9630
No problem! I was dropping in to get the 'top 5 questions' anyway

Thank you for finally posting that @arweave-sam

No worries @Rabbi


[31-Jan-19 08:31 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Happy to answer any questions


[31-Jan-19 08:31 AM] Rabbi#2072
Can you ask your admins to unblock my old account DaVinci?


[31-Jan-19 08:32 AM] Rabbi#2072
Also, @arweave-sophie kept telling me via email that this is private information that cannot be released until they verified i was a private sale contributor... whats up with this?


[31-Jan-19 08:32 AM] Rabbi#2072
As I reiterated earlier in the conversation, if you were part of the private sale then we are happy to release this information to you. However, I can see that this email address isn't associated with any sale - public or private.

If you did indeed take part in the private sale, please let me know what email address the invite was sent to and I will send over all relevant information. Otherwise, this sale was explicitly private, therefore why the details are not available publicly.


[31-Jan-19 08:32 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Why was your prior account blocked?


[31-Jan-19 08:33 AM] Rabbi#2072
Because i asked for tokenmoics


[31-Jan-19 08:33 AM] Rabbi#2072
tokenomics* you can scroll up and read everything. I kept asking the same question, and not getting a response


[31-Jan-19 08:34 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The community sale was a private event, by invitation only. Sophie was following the advice of our legal team that the specifics of the sale should only be given to those that were invited to participate.

{Reactions}
  

[31-Jan-19 08:34 AM] Rabbi#2072
The 'community' sale was a 'private' event


[31-Jan-19 08:34 AM] Rabbi#2072
Thats the opposite definition


[31-Jan-19 08:35 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yes, it was highly selective. We filtered tens of thousands of applications to take part to just ~1500.


[31-Jan-19 08:36 AM] Rabbi#2072
What does that have to do with informing the other ICO investors and community about the tokenomics of the project


[31-Jan-19 08:36 AM] Rabbi#2072
Also, you did not have 1500 investors in the private sale. that is not true


[31-Jan-19 08:37 AM] Rabbi#2072
On another note--- Community Sale Part 1 was not part of private sale?


[31-Jan-19 08:38 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Every token sale purchaser had access to this information at the time of sale.

> you did not have 1500 investors in the private sale.


[31-Jan-19 08:38 AM] arweave-sam#9630
In community sale part 2, yes we did.


[31-Jan-19 08:38 AM] Rabbi#2072
Yes part 2, not 1.


[31-Jan-19 08:38 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Correct


[31-Jan-19 08:38 AM] Rabbi#2072
Isnt part 1 part of private sale?


[31-Jan-19 08:39 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yes, we bunched part one of the community sale in with the institutional purchasers in the private sale (so that they were the same price).


[31-Jan-19 08:40 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Community sale part 1 was for community members that had been waiting to buy since the seed round, community sale part 2 was for those that found us after the end of the private sale.


[31-Jan-19 08:40 AM] Rabbi#2072
Ok great, that makes sense


[31-Jan-19 08:40 AM] Rabbi#2072
Did strategic get a different price?


[31-Jan-19 08:40 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yes


[31-Jan-19 08:42 AM] Rabbi#2072
Were the institutional private sales limited to 50ETH?


[31-Jan-19 08:42 AM] arweave-sam#9630
No, but they did all take extremely small allocations compared to other projects


[31-Jan-19 08:43 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The private round was split (IIRC) between around 35 different institutionals


[31-Jan-19 08:43 AM] Rabbi#2072
Ok, so in reality there are about ~2000 token holders?

It is hard to tell now, as we see lots of people doing (what we assume are) OTC trades


[31-Jan-19 08:44 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Viewblock says there are 3800 addresses


[31-Jan-19 08:44 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Probably ~90% of those are unique


[31-Jan-19 08:45 AM] Rabbi#2072
Yep


[31-Jan-19 08:45 AM] arweave-sam#9630

Sam, thank you for your direct answers for once. What inspired you to show up in the chats today?


[31-Jan-19 08:46 AM] arweave-sam#9630
It is frustrating from an administrative point tbh @Vilenarios


[31-Jan-19 08:46 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@Rabbi We have been planning at `top 5` questions video


[31-Jan-19 08:46 AM] arweave-sam#9630
And I needed to collect said questions


[31-Jan-19 08:47 AM] Rabbi#2072
Ok, i am eagerly waiting for those answers


[31-Jan-19 08:48 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Then I saw your question in the top 5 channel and figured this is best done in text. Reading numbers of segments of the allocations would be a pretty boring video

> Is there an API call to fetch number of tokens?

Not explicitly, but you can sum the totals in the `GET /wallet_list` endpoints and work it out


[31-Jan-19 08:51 AM] Rabbi#2072
Ok, ill check that out. Last question. In the email i asked to be forwarded a copy of the terms/conditions of the sale when I contributed. I dont have a saved copy and dont recall ever reading the terms sheet (this was many months ago so very well could be that i just do not remember)


[31-Jan-19 08:51 AM] Rabbi#2072
Can i get a forwarded copy of the terms?


[31-Jan-19 08:52 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep, the team@arweave.org people can send over all of that stuff to everyone that verifies they took part in the sale


[31-Jan-19 08:53 AM] Rabbi#2072
Why do i have to verify?


[31-Jan-19 08:54 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Again, our legal team advises that we keep the sale docs private to those that were invited to participate, as it was a private sale.


[31-Jan-19 08:54 AM] Rabbi#2072
I dont understand what legal implications you could have by released those docs


[31-Jan-19 08:55 AM] Rabbi#2072
But doesnt seem like you will, so ok


[31-Jan-19 08:55 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I am not a lawyer, but it is in the project's best interest that I follow their advice, so I do  


[31-Jan-19 08:55 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Anything else?


[31-Jan-19 08:56 AM] Rabbi#2072
So the terms, if released, are harmful to the project?


[31-Jan-19 08:56 AM] arweave-sam#9630
No, haha


[31-Jan-19 08:56 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The sale was private


[31-Jan-19 08:57 AM] arweave-sam#9630
So the terms are between us and the private individuals


[31-Jan-19 08:57 AM] arweave-sam#9630

[31-Jan-19 08:58 AM] Rabbi#2072

[31-Jan-19 09:07 AM] Rabbi#2072
@arweave-sam yes, but you can give us basic updates that dont break the NDA


[31-Jan-19 09:07 AM] Rabbi#2072
Instead of the same copy/paste since May


[31-Jan-19 09:09 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We have said what we can: namely that we are in the process of exchange integration. We recently (Tuesday) also released a mining client upgrade that makes it easier for people to integrate with Arweave.


[31-Jan-19 09:10 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I also explained in a recent email (last week?) why integration with Arweave is more complex than other tokens


[31-Jan-19 09:11 AM] arweave-sam#9630
ERC-20s are literally a couple of lines to integrate, then most 'main net' tokens are forked from each other to some extent or another, so they share a common API. We are one of very few tokens that are truly written from scratch.


[31-Jan-19 09:12 AM] Rabbi#2072
Viewblock and Upvest integrated your token just fine


[31-Jan-19 09:12 AM] Rabbi#2072
Any competent exchange can do the same


[31-Jan-19 09:12 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We recently did an analysis of some exchanges that list hundreds of token pairs. We worked out that there were perhaps ~15 truly unique interfaces for these tokens.


[31-Jan-19 09:13 AM] arweave-sam#9630
> Viewblock and Upvest integrated your token just fine

VB only read data from the weave, so that is super simple. We were working with Upvest for many months before launch of the network.


[31-Jan-19 09:15 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Before we were 'discovered' by the wider crypto community shortly after the private sale ended, we had been working with a decentralised exchange that we planned to list on just after launch. Unfortunately, after the massive influx of new community members we had it quickly became clear that this dex wasn't going to be able to handle the traffic appropriately.


[31-Jan-19 09:15 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Subsequently, we found more appropriate exchange partners and began to work with them.


[31-Jan-19 09:17 AM] arweave-sam#9630
> dont break the NDA

You might be surprised how difficult this is. Good exchanges move markets, so the best ones required projects not to release *any* details until the listing is complete in order to avoid potential market shenanigans. This is good for the long-term (shows they are serious about compliance and fairness for their customers), but it makes things difficult prior to the listing.


[31-Jan-19 09:31 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Everybody wants to talk about exchanges until I am around to join in  


[31-Jan-19 09:31 AM] arweave-sam#9630

[01-Mar-19 11:36 PM] Mazzz#1871
Hi, will it cost less AR to archive a page in the future? And what determines the archiving cost? Thanks.


[02-Mar-19 12:10 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Mazzz The price cost of storage is $0.013/MB, but price can fluctuate depending on the availability of storage in our network.


[02-Mar-19 12:45 AM] Mazzz#1871
@arweave-stan do you mean 0.013  AR or USD? If its USD how will it be correlated to AR?


[02-Mar-19 12:51 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Mazzz Charged in USD, but you're paying with AR.


[02-Mar-19 12:52 AM] Mazzz#1871
@arweave-stan how will the conversion take place?


[02-Mar-19 12:52 AM] arweave-stan#3973
you will be charged in usd but AR equivalent will be deducted


[02-Mar-19 12:54 AM] Mazzz#1871
@arweave-stan  How is it being charged now? When the price of AR is unknown?


[02-Mar-19 01:00 AM] arweave-stan#3973
Very little amount is being charged and
the size of the fee is determined by the size of the data you want to store, and the fee is distributed over time to miners who store the data.


[02-Mar-19 01:22 AM] Mazzz#1871
@arweave-stan So the storage price depends on the price of  the coin. Does that the coin can't really increase in price because storage will be too expensive?


[02-Mar-19 01:30 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Mazzz yes, the storage price depends on the price of the coin, and the price can fluctuate depending on the availability on the network,


[02-Mar-19 01:35 AM] arweave-stan#3973
Also like I said the price cost of storage is $0.013/MB, and if the price of the coin increases, you're still paying around $0.013/MB equivalent in AR.


[02-Mar-19 02:08 AM] Mazzz#1871
@arweave-stan  Oh okay


[02-Mar-19 02:18 AM] arweave-stan#3973
  


[05-Mar-19 03:48 AM] ivhturp#3325
@arweave-stan Probably a noob question, but how does the Archain determine the conversion ratio of AR:USD ?


[05-Mar-19 04:12 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@ivhturp the AR:USD conversion ratio has to do with the Ar current price in USD, the storage cost is around $0.013/MB.


[05-Mar-19 04:15 AM] arweave-stan#3973
Also please we're no longer Archain, but Arweave.


[05-Mar-19 04:19 AM] ivhturp#3325
When I upload the file to arweave, how will arweave block chain know the market conversion price of AR to USD?


[05-Mar-19 04:20 AM] ivhturp#3325
As AR price will keep fluctuating as per market dynamics


[05-Mar-19 04:22 AM] arweave-stan#3973
With the help of API, Ar blockchain can determine the average USD price of Ar.


[05-Mar-19 04:23 AM] ivhturp#3325
So, does this API call any exchange to determine the price or arweave servers?


[05-Mar-19 04:25 AM] arweave-stan#3973
The API is being integrated, which will help with the current price of Ar. for clear explanation, when you check etherscan.com, you will be able to see the current price of ETH at any time.


[05-Mar-19 04:26 AM] arweave-stan#3973
But I'll help you to check with the team to get more clarification, if my own explanation is not enough please.


[05-Mar-19 04:33 AM] ivhturp#3325
Cool, thanks @arweave-stan


[05-Mar-19 04:34 AM] arweave-stan#3973
It's my pleasure, and thanks for the support


[05-Mar-19 04:45 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan Well, So you know the AR:USD price, so why are you hiding it? Ok, tell me a storage cost for 1 MB in AR, not in USD (i have AR, not USD and i will pay in AR)


[05-Mar-19 04:47 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
I believe that this is a utility token (but not exactly security, because there are no dividends or are there?), and accordingly, it is used on the network, and accordingly, I can know the storage price of 1 MB in AR, isn't it?


[05-Mar-19 04:48 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@slayer_hellraiser I'm sorry, I do know the current price of Ar as we're not yet on exchange, but the cost for storage is around $0.013/MB


[05-Mar-19 04:48 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Waiting for your answer, team


[05-Mar-19 04:49 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan And yes, I want to know the cost of saving one megabyte in your tokens, because they will be accepted for payment, not USD


[05-Mar-19 04:51 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-lev @arweave-martin @arweave-sophie Maybe you can tell me about the cost of storing 1 MB in AR tokens? You do not accept USD directly, you need tokens for payment for storage, so I want to know the cost in tokens, not in USD.


[05-Mar-19 04:51 AM] arweave-stan#3973
Please at the moment, you're paying very little for storage, but I'll have to confirm with the team to know if there's more information to share with you. Kindly stay tuned and thanks for your patience.


[05-Mar-19 04:53 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-stan I would like to save about 20 GB and I want to understand the cost of storage (I have tokens for payment of storage, I hope they will be enough)


[05-Mar-19 04:54 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@slayer_hellraiser please I've forwarded your question about how much Ar you will be charged per MB, I'll get back to you. Thanks

{Reactions}
  

[05-Mar-19 05:07 AM] ivhturp#3325
@slayer_hellraiser , the arweave extension shows a price of 0.040254297476 AR for 365.03 KB which places AR price @ 0.118 USD assuming $0.013/MB


[05-Mar-19 05:11 AM] ivhturp#3325
Considering ETH @ 573$ and 847.73 AR per ETH  during ICO, AR price is around $0.15 with current ETH price @ $129

@arweave-lev How will each node know the conversion ratio of AR/USD ? Can node not behave maliciously in such cases?


[05-Mar-19 06:23 AM] arweave-lev#3466
Nodes do not know the conversion rate, but the price depends on the current  PoW difficulty, which correlates with the network size, which is in turn connected with the demand. We have ideas about other mechanisms to control the ratio, but it is too early to give any details afaik.

I’m totally confused guys


[05-Mar-19 03:17 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Where does .013 cents Mb come from? Is that just the general cost of buying hard drive space?


[05-Mar-19 03:25 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@Vilenarios  cost of storage is around $0.013/MB, but price can fluctuate depending on the availability of storage in our network.

There is an HTTP endpoint giving estimations: /price/<size-in-bytes>. It responds with a price in Winston so divide by 1000000000000.


[05-Mar-19 04:04 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Yeah it responds the the price in Winston... not USD


[05-Mar-19 04:08 PM] Vilenarios#8742
How did the team come up with .013 cents usd?


[05-Mar-19 04:14 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@Vilenarios the $0.013/MB is most likely to be the equivalent of the price of the Winston. 

Also, another thing you should know is that the price per MB goes up with the size.


[05-Mar-19 04:15 PM] arweave-stan#3973
For example, storing one 1000MB file is much higher than splitting it up the 1000MB into 1000 chunks of 1MB.


[05-Mar-19 04:18 PM] Vilenarios#8742
So regardless of what AR price is the team has pegged data upload to the price of USD


[05-Mar-19 04:19 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Even though AR/USD price isn’t established yet....


[05-Mar-19 04:19 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@Vilenarios yes, but the price can fluctuate depending on the availability of storage in our network.


[05-Mar-19 04:30 PM] Vilenarios#8742
“the arweave extension shows a price of 0.040254297476 AR for 365.03 KB which places AR price @ 0.118 USD assuming $0.013/MB”


[05-Mar-19 04:31 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Stinks for all the community buyers who paid 6x that amount. When did Arweave decided to use the $.013?


[05-Mar-19 05:29 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@Vilenarios I'm sorry, but that's what it was estimated at and also know that the price can also fluctuate as I already said, also do bear mind that the price per MB goes up with the size.


[05-Mar-19 05:30 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Yup very good point re size/price ratio


[05-Mar-19 05:32 PM] arweave-stan#3973
You can always use the HTTP endpoint to get the estimations: /price/<size-in-bytes>. It responds with a price in Winston so divide by 1000000000000.


[10-Mar-19 09:24 PM] DesignBlock#0184
@arweave-stan why is that? Isnt it storing a single file with large size much cheaper than storing many files of same total size?


[10-Mar-19 09:25 PM] DesignBlock#0184
@arweave-stan how pricing works? Will they connect it to coinmarketcap price or something?


[10-Mar-19 09:27 PM] DesignBlock#0184
@arweave-lev so price is related with storage demand, not AR price


[11-Mar-19 05:03 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@DesignBlock It's cheaper to split one large files into several small transactions compared to upload the whole file in one large transaction. 1MB is a reasonable chunk-size when splitting. It's easier for the network to handle many small transactions. Therefore the price incentivises the users to split up their large files into smaller transactions.

@DesignBlock the price in AR is initially based on an estimation of the storage costs in fiat and the ICO price of AR, but it is adjusted according to the network difficulty. Our team is working on the paper, which would explain the economic model behind the price in detail.

[30-Mar-19 03:47 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@DesignBlock 400k USD is a public sale hard cap.


[30-Mar-19 03:54 AM] DesignBlock#0184

What is AR circ and total supply?


[30-Mar-19 03:56 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
>>others says different
@DesignBlock Who is others?


[30-Mar-19 03:57 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@DesignBlock The total genesis block supply is 55 million tokens (with additional 11mil distributed in the future as mining rewards) and the I believe the circulating supply is approximately 41-42% of the genesis block tokens (so that's approximately 23 mil tokens).


[31-Mar-19 12:18 AM] ivhturp#3325
Hi @arweave-stan, can you please share any article with detailed explanation of circulating supply and lockup schedules

@ivhturp - Total Genesis Block supply of tokens sold: 38.5% (no lock up)
- Allocation to the project team: 13% (5 yr lockup, 20% released per yr)
- Future use of the project: 26.5% (5 yr lockup, 20% released per yr)

So around 21 million tokens sold, and still 11 million for mining?


[31-Mar-19 03:33 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@Marcin yeah that's correct, 38.5% of 55million of the total genesis block sold, and 11million is for mining rewards.


[31-Mar-19 10:34 PM] ivhturp#3325
Is there any lockup for seed, strategic or private rounds?


[31-Mar-19 11:15 PM] ATLAS#7218
iirc seed and privates are unlocked

@ivhturp there's no lockup on 38.5% of the sold tokens. You can scroll up to see my previous reply. Thanks

[17-May-19 09:20 AM] Allmandring#8082
quick question - was looking through the viewblock explorer and (between 2. and 17. address list page https://viewblock.io/arweave/addresses) there seem to be about 330 addresses with each exactly 100.000 AR genesis tokens....


[17-May-19 09:20 AM] Allmandring#8082
which would be 33M tokens altogether ...


[17-May-19 09:20 AM] Allmandring#8082
but looking at the "Arweave Token Allocation Table" posted above - how do these fit in? its such a large amount ...


[17-May-19 09:44 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Well, i saw a few address with 500k minimum, Big whales )


[17-May-19 10:02 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Allmandring please the wallets are wallets owned by the project for future use or distribution to sale participants who haven’t claimed their tokens yet.


[17-May-19 10:19 AM] Allmandring#8082
ok thanks - but kind of weird to just disperse something like that between 330 different wallets - wouldn't you agree?  its still 33M tokens with, like you said, different uses...


[17-May-19 10:19 AM] Allmandring#8082
just curious - not the usual way of doing things


[17-May-19 10:19 AM] Allmandring#8082
best case scenario for an explorer is that you can go in and see how much is held by the team, see wallets from the exchanges and maybe get a quick insight what does wealth distribution look like i.e. how many addresses/transactions and how many "whales"...


[17-May-19 10:37 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Allmandring We keep it like this because having smaller wallets means that the wallet public keys are not exposed on the network until the tokens are sent. This makes them less vulnerable in the event of discovery of an RSA-4096 weakness. Thanks


[23-May-19 05:26 PM] Scale#8888
@arweave-stan did the team already receive 20% from the future use and team alloc? roughly what month would be a year?


[23-May-19 05:35 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@Scale the team allocation and future use of the project allocation is locked for 5yrs, 20% release each year. We're not yet on exchange, so the token is not yet unlock. Thanks


[24-May-19 05:21 PM] aurora#3501
so the 20% release each year will start after exchange listing ?


[24-May-19 05:33 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@aurora please I'll help you to confirm. Stay tuned.


[24-May-19 06:56 PM] arweave-stan#3973

@soulworksuk Sam addressed this a little while ago in the token-economics channel - we can't answer your question explicitly, as we have said before due to NDAs, etc., but Sam gives more context in the other channel about the current situation

I have seen so many use cases and utilities of this token in your latest videos, but when are you going to make them known for real? They have a ridiculous small amount of viewers, you need to talk to some youtube influencers, or something. Not only to increase the value of Arweave but to get more devs and ideas.

@ATLAS no it is not fixed on USD value, it depends on the network.. any admin to clarify?


[16-Apr-19 01:46 AM] arweave-stan#3973
Hey @DesignBlock for storage cost. you can ask the network for the current price to store a certain amount of data. So for 1MB (1048576 bytes) the current cost is found here: http://arweave.net/price/1048576, 
The price is in Winston, so you should divide it with 1000000000000 to get the number of AR.

Thanks Jon and Sam, I stored it carefully. Thanks very much for supporting ☺️


[20-Oct-17 02:17 PM] arweave-sam#9630
No problem at all -- let us know if you have any other questions!


[20-Oct-17 02:18 PM] Mimi#1207
Will do. Thanks ☺️


[20-Oct-17 02:18 PM] Mimi#1207
Can't wait to see the project succeed

Hello! @arweave-sam any idea as to what the sale prices will look like?


[06-Nov-17 06:20 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hi @HiteshB the details of the sale are currently being finalised. We will post about this on the Archain Medium blog (https://medium.com/@archain) in the next few weeks!

Hi team!  I ran through the steps to initiate mining, though without a genesis event yet, I'm not sure anything should be happening.  Is there a testnet running?  Here is my terminal output.  Does this look correct?  Should the log be updating?

Hi Mike! If you have been running it for a while without any output please can you send us the log file in a private chat?


[08-Nov-17 09:06 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We will then have a look at it and see what is going on.


[08-Nov-17 09:06 AM] Mike#2447
I'm currently running it in a VM, so perhaps my power is too low.


[08-Nov-17 09:07 AM] arweave-sam#9630
It could be a port forwarding issue in that case?


[08-Nov-17 09:08 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Can you access http://[your_ip]/info from outside the VM?


[08-Nov-17 09:12 AM] Mike#2447
No, but I'm behind my office's firewall.  I can try again later from home on a linux laptop.


[08-Nov-17 09:12 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Ah, that is probably causing the issue


[08-Nov-17 09:14 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We will make sure to add a section about port forwarding to the docs.

Hi MigueKun! Your public key will still be visible on your order page (but not your private key), if you still have the confirmation email? If not, please send us an email to 'team@archain.org' and we will sort it out for you.

Hi @Mike  - Thanks very much for this, I'll make sure it's passed on to the dev team right away.


[23-Nov-17 11:34 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hi @Mike : Just a heads-up that we have now added support for systems behind firewalls or without access to port forwarding. Starting a node with the 'polling' command line option will now allow you to mine blocks as long as you have outbound access on port 1984 to at least one other peer in the network.


[26-Nov-17 02:21 PM] Mike#2447
Thanks @arweave-sam , I seem to be successfully processing blocks.  Beyond that, I'm not sure if test ARC are being generated anywhere on the network.  Can you explain what all is taking place while mining on the test network?


[02-Dec-17 06:59 AM] Mike#2447
So I've been mining for about 10 days now and have 4,200+ blocks in my blocks folder.  I'm having trouble navigating the documentation.  Is it possible to view the blockweave content?  Is there a wallet with a balance of ARC somewhere on my machine?  Or an address that can be checked in a weave explorer?  Thanks for the help!


[04-Dec-17 06:07 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Hi @Mike


[04-Dec-17 06:09 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Miners should be genearting AR into their own wallets


[04-Dec-17 06:10 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
If you have the TXid from the transaction it should be easy to find


[04-Dec-17 06:10 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
I can help you find the right function if you need


[04-Dec-17 06:11 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
The best way to look at your wallet and to archive/recall pages is with the web extension as well


[04-Dec-17 06:12 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
It'll give you a link to any page you archive, let you upload your keys and see your wallet balance


[04-Dec-17 08:22 AM] Mike#2447
It looks like I should have received a test network key file or a link to such file, but I can't find any record of that.  I have the email that has a link to my written keys, but I don't recall any downloadable key file that I could have saved to drop in the Chrome extension.


[04-Dec-17 08:52 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
We've updated the orders page that has your written keys


[04-Dec-17 08:52 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
It should have a link to generate a testnet keyfile


[04-Dec-17 12:15 PM] Mike#2447
The page doesn't appear to have the keyfile link yet.  I'll keep checking back.


[06-Dec-17 08:31 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
It's possible you are not the right tier of backer to recieve early access to the chain


[06-Dec-17 08:31 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
If you private message me the email you made the purchase on, I can check for you


[06-Dec-17 08:32 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
I've added you @Mike


[06-Dec-17 08:41 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Sorry, to clarify: Early access on the testnet to your backer wallet


[13-Dec-17 09:49 AM] Marcin#0065
Hey guys. I somehow managed to contribute a little while ago. I have the paper printed out and since then i almost have forgotten about the project. I just see its not dead, thankfully   but my question, since i have not followed the project for a long time, i wanted to ask, if i have missed something regarding my tokens. Any kind of further registration or anything like that? I have the printed paper only so far with all the codes. If not, i just keep the printed paper and wish the best for you all and the project, right?


[13-Dec-17 11:44 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hi @Marcin - If you have your keys printed out safely, then you are all set! No need to do anything further at this time.  You can always keep up with the latest developments on our Medium blog (https://medium.com/@archain), or by following us on Twitter (@ArchainTeam).

Thank you for the well wishes!

[14-Dec-17 12:30 PM] Marcin#0065
is there a simple way of mining for people like me? somehow like in the monero app, where u click one button only?
or maybe a simple way like claymore?


[18-Dec-17 12:36 PM] arweave-india#5075
Hi @Marcin - we have a small script that you can run to download and run the latest test network miner on Ubuntu machines. You can find it, and the instructions for running it, on our github page here: https://github.com/ArchainTeam/archain. During the backer test network phase the IP starting node IP addresses are kept private, so you will need to find it in the backer email you should have received on November the 7th.

In time we will be vastly upgrading the user experience of the miner, including a simple (likely web) UI for configuration and management tasks.

Let us know if you require any further assistance!


[18-Dec-17 12:59 PM] Marcin#0065
i will try that out   thank you.


[18-Dec-17 05:09 PM] Marcin#0065
@arweave-india I have run the commands written. It stops at a certain heigh and nothing else happens. I didnt even put in any kind of adress to be identified. Its weird to mine.


[18-Dec-17 05:13 PM] Marcin#0065
It says: node_joined_sucessfully, heigh 2623. nothing happend afterwards. Anything else to do?


[19-Dec-17 06:17 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Hi @Marcin


[19-Dec-17 06:18 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
You shouldn't need to do anything else, it's very likely working


[19-Dec-17 06:19 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
If you want to check, you could try doing:


[19-Dec-17 06:19 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
make catlog


[19-Dec-17 06:20 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
to check the logs, you should see blocks being accepted


[19-Dec-17 08:54 AM] Marcin#0065
i dont know much about programming so i cant fully understand the scrypts. but the number of blocks is fixed and they are downloaded to the specific number shown in the terminal. after that no more data is being downloaded. there is a process running, but i cant figure out what the pc is doing. 
every time i restart the mining command, the blocks are being downloaded again.
furthermore im used to havin some kidn of miner/worker showing some statistics.

i guess i will wait, till its easier to mine.   keep it up guys,  i like your idea


[19-Dec-17 09:03 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
It may take a while for a new block to mine


[19-Dec-17 09:04 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Perhaps you could send me a private message with your log in? I'd be happy to have a look at it


[19-Dec-17 09:35 AM] Marcin#0065
which log in? i run the cammdn line without any information regaring myself. im sorry, i just understan dtoo little to get it right :)
i need somethink like claymore , then i will start run the pc for the project, since its running all time anyway


[19-Dec-17 10:02 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Oh sorry - I just realised how unclear that was


[19-Dec-17 10:02 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
I meant, if you could private message me the result of your make catlog


[19-Dec-17 10:02 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
I'd be happy to look over it for you


[19-Dec-17 11:42 AM] Marcin#0065
okay. i will let it run that night over again.
will send u send what i got.

last time after all night nothing has changed as for me, but the pc was doing something. by temperatures not much, the cpu stayed chilly.


[19-Dec-17 11:44 AM] Marcin#0065
and since its cold here already, i need something to heat my cpus, my room is getting cold  


[19-Dec-17 11:51 AM] Marcin#0065
any chance to get it running on windows too?


[19-Dec-17 12:54 PM] WillRogerJones#8527
We'll certainly get it working on Windows at some point, but it's much trickier


[19-Dec-17 12:55 PM] WillRogerJones#8527
I'm not actually sure you're going to do much CPU thrashing though! The total hashing power on the network isn't that high at the moment :p


[19-Dec-17 01:35 PM] Marcin#0065
do you mind a teamviewer session on my screen? is there a teamviewer for ubuntu? will be much easier for you to check the files i think. 
next question: by letting my pc mine, how are the tokens/coin (arcs) mined? are the tokens belonging to the miners who mined it? or it is a volentary phase at the moment?


[20-Dec-17 06:42 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Hi @Marcin


[20-Dec-17 06:42 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
We might be able to arrange a teamviewer session if you'd like, but I'll have to look into how to do this securely


[20-Dec-17 06:43 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
I'll check the code for a definite answer, but I believe the token reward for mining is unclaimed by default at the moment


[20-Dec-17 06:47 AM] Marcin#0065
okay, maybe i arrange to copy paste the needed filed and copy the text in here.
my observation so far:
the block shown in the terminal (heigh: xxxx, lets say it was 3069 last night) are being downloaded. the more block are in the folder, the longer it takes for the next block. after the amount of blocks is downloaded, nothing else happens.


[20-Dec-17 06:48 AM] Marcin#0065
and every time i start the command, i guess the "clean" deletes all of them and the download starts again


[20-Dec-17 06:48 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Ah, okay


[20-Dec-17 06:49 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
It seems to us that you might have a port forwarding issue


[20-Dec-17 06:49 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
But this can be remedied by appending the "polling" flag to the server start


[20-Dec-17 06:49 AM] Marcin#0065
the programmer language sounds like magic to me  


[20-Dec-17 06:50 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
don't worry, you just have to add " polling" to command line that you're running to start the server


[20-Dec-17 06:50 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
for example:


[20-Dec-17 06:50 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
./archain-server mine polling peer XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX etc


[20-Dec-17 06:51 AM] Marcin#0065
at the moment im running:

./archain.server peer XXX.XX.X.XX mine" where the X is replaced by the ip in the email


[20-Dec-17 06:51 AM] Marcin#0065
ah okay, will try out mom


[20-Dec-17 06:51 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
yeah


[20-Dec-17 06:52 AM] Marcin#0065
heigh 3438 atm


[20-Dec-17 06:53 AM] Marcin#0065
the  block files in the folder are being downlaoded again


[20-Dec-17 06:53 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Great! thats in synch with what we're on


[20-Dec-17 06:54 AM] Marcin#0065
and why are the block deleted first to be downlaoded again?


[20-Dec-17 06:54 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
This is just a testing thing at the moment, we'll be sure to remove this for product release!


[20-Dec-17 06:55 AM] Marcin#0065
ah okay


[20-Dec-17 06:56 AM] Marcin#0065

Hi @Marcin , that might be because the master branch of the github repo is now incompatible with the current alpha test network (in preparation for BATN.4 release in January). Could you try joining the network (in the same way as before) with this release: https://github.com/ArchainTeam/archain/releases/tag/BATN.3 ?

I am going to try that out in 2 hours, when back home.  


[20-Dec-17 09:05 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Great!


[20-Dec-17 09:09 AM] Marcin#0065
Thx :)
When everything launches and the project will be running sucessfully, how do you determine, who mined a block? Will we need to use our public adresses as identification?


[20-Dec-17 09:23 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yes, in future releases you will specify the key file that should be credited with block rewards, etc. You can actually do it now, but you would need to use the Erlang programming interface to set it up.


[20-Dec-17 09:27 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Eventually there will be a nice UI for configuring the miner, but we are currently focusing on the user experience of the front-end clients and the programmatic correctness of the mining server.


[20-Dec-17 10:34 AM] Marcin#0065
If i could do it now, will that actually gain myself arc token already?
As i dont understand much about programming, i cannot set up it on myself :/
How long does it take to set up a command / file , to be credited with blockrewards?


[20-Dec-17 10:37 AM] Marcin#0065
As i believe in the project, i would be willing to pay for setting up some kind of „put your archain adress here“ file and let it run. I really like your idea much and would be happy to let my pc work for you (and my warm room   )


[20-Dec-17 10:50 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hi Marcin, earning mining rewards on the test network would not be worthwhile at the moment, as we will be resetting the network for BATN.4 in January. Until main network launch mining rewards won't carry over between network resets. I will, however, make sure that there is an easy interface for loading a key file to reward in BATN.4.

As a side note, not clearing the block cache by default has now been implemented: https://github.com/ArchainTeam/archain/commit/240f5ece294cbfc7e10f2ffa5ab68baf88f33bb0 . That will be present in BATN.4, too.

Thank you for posting the info about staying on BATN.3!  In the belief that I was making some errors, I've been downloading the current source every couple days in hopes that mining would be fixed.  Turns out I was just using the wrong version.  After going back to the BATN.3 version, everything seems to be running smooth again.


[23-Dec-17 03:56 AM] Marcin#0065
Do you plan to set up your own, official mining pool? It would be easy for many potential miners to join for mining. A miners website with a list of workers and some stats about mining time, hash and rewards.


[23-Dec-17 06:25 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hi @Mike, yep, we will be using GitHub release tags in the future to keep this simple. Sorry for the confusion!

@Marcin: congratulations! That means that you mined a block.

We haven't planned to start a public mining pool so far, and I would be a little hesitant to in case it encouraged too much centralisation while the network is small. We do plan to run a non-profit mining operation that will spend the AR it earns mining to archive important historical documents, though.


[23-Dec-17 01:14 PM] Marcin#0065
Wow thats a cool idea! would love to let some resources for important documents. Maybe some kind of percentage donation from every block mined. I would surely let some hashing power, lets say around 10-15%, be for historic documents. But everyone should individually decide how mich be wants to donate.

Hi @Redmario90

The keyfile that is used with the webextension is different from the keys you've written down in your text file


[08-Feb-18 03:04 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
We don't want people exposing their main network keys on the test network, so instead users use test network keys


[08-Feb-18 03:07 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
If you purchased enough tokens to participate in the test network, you should be able to generate a set of test network keys on the wallet - though they might not be usable until the next network reset


[08-Feb-18 03:07 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
alternatively, the next major release of the network will be public, and anybody will be able to participate freely!


[08-Feb-18 03:09 AM] BBM#0001

Since the concept behind Archain is an uncensorable internet, is there any notion of removing something from the blockweave? I was wondering if any considerations had been made with regards to the legalities around storing/mining the data if someone has chosen to store things that most people would not want, i.e. child pornography. If I were to be holder of that data and it be considered rare data, would I not be held responsible for distribution of that - perhaps without my knowledge?


[20-Feb-18 06:12 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
@vyrrt

Though it is not widely discussed in our whitepaper, we have a very strong policy of voluntarism on the part of the miners that creates a system for democratised content rejection -- no miner can be forced to store any content that they dislike.

Broadly, miners can maintain a lists of content (by hash and by keyword) that they will not accept in blocks - this lets them filter bad content without storing it themselves. The net effect of this is that even miners that don't blacklist themselves don't want to accept transactions containing content that they think will be widely rejected by other miners; if they mine these transactions into their block then there is a high likelihood that this block won't be accepted into the network, and that they will not receive their mining reward.

This system works for content that the network strongly agrees is bad, and stops it getting on to the chain in the first place, but it's obviously not possible to prevent all the content that might upset anybody being placed on the chain. However, to address this, there is also a system that allows users to post "don't serve this" transactions onto the network. These transactions post a hash of the transaction that the user doesn't want served, and lets miners make the choice about whether to serve these transactions or not.

Finally, just to specifically address any concern about your own hard drive: because the chain shards and nobody is obligated to store any content they don't wish to, if you don't like the content of a block, you can simply drop it.


[05-Mar-18 07:29 PM]  #3138
Seeing as how the presale occurred 8 months before the ico, i strongly think there will be a very large presale incentive, similar to Wabi, where the presale was already 8-10x profit from ICO price


[05-Mar-18 07:30 PM]  #3138
Along with the potential this project has and the revolutionary tech behind it, and the incubator that boosted Uber backing this project, there's no chance that presale backers don't have at least 25x profit once main net launches

Are there any plans for after June, when the main network is released? Aside from maintenance and tweaking?


[08-Mar-18 09:07 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Absolutely -- our primary goal is to drive developer adoption of the system. We are starting a developer-focused bounty campaign over the next few days (India is just finishing off the rules, I believe) that we want to use as a springboard for building the dev community. There are also a number of first-party projects that we would like to build on top of the system, but we see our core role as encouraging developers and giving them the best possible tools to build permanence-based apps.

[20-Mar-18 03:11 PM] vimal.s08#6053
The error is simply "error submitting page"


[20-Mar-18 03:19 PM] arweave-india#5075
Hey Vimal, just letting you know that @WillRogerJones is going to look into this for you first thing tomorrow :)


[20-Mar-18 03:34 PM] vimal.s08#6053
Sounds good. Thanks!


[21-Mar-18 08:58 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Hi @vimal.s08, sorry for the wait - i've been a little ill today


[21-Mar-18 08:58 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
We've tracked down what is causing this and we'll get it fixed for you soon. Sorry for the problems.


[21-Mar-18 09:02 AM] vimal.s08#6053
No worries.... Just wanted to make sure my keys were working.


[27-Apr-18 09:42 AM] Mike#2447
Dev Team, can you tell me if everything looks good here?  This is basically all that gets displayed in the terminal.  I recall for past releases when mining, it seemed like there was more output in the terminal as far as showing new blocks and whatnot.  Should users be doing something about the unclaimed address messages?  Also, I'm seeing the downloading of blocks seems to stop after a short while, compared to previous releases where all blocks would be downloaded.  If I close the mining terminal and start again, more blocks get downloaded, but then again it stops after a short while.  I posted the output of "make log" which always shows this error.  I'm seeing all these same results on 3 different computers.  Thanks!

@Mike I was getting the same errors today


[27-Apr-18 09:55 AM] enilsen16#0335
Might just be someone playing around with the transaction format


[30-Apr-18 12:03 PM] WillRogerJones#8527
Hi @Mike  We have played around with the joining behavior recently, I wouldn't worry about this. If you send us the log file (look for the most recently dated log in your logs directory), we'd certainly be happy to take a closer look though. 

@enilsen16  Yeah, this is likely. It shouldn't cause any problems with the function of the server, but you will get these error messages if people are playing about and creating malformed transactions.


[02-May-18 07:48 AM] enilsen16#0335
I see. Shouldn't the local node of whoever is send malformed transactions not send these across the network?


[02-May-18 08:20 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Node shouldn't gossip malformed transactions around the network, but we can't really stop people sending malformed txs if they're playing around

[02-May-18 08:28 AM] Synergy#5794
Are the tokens I bought during ico still viable


[02-May-18 08:29 AM] enilsen16#0335
>Are the tokens I bought during ico still viable

Yeah. Just a small rebrand


[02-May-18 08:29 AM] Synergy#5794
And the tokens are still A-ok?


[02-May-18 08:30 AM] enilsen16#0335
Yeah to my knowledge there isn't you need to do. cc/ @arweave-india ?


[02-May-18 08:32 AM] Synergy#5794
The tokens aren't on any exchange or decentralized platform are they? Such as Idex


[02-May-18 08:32 AM] enilsen16#0335
Not yet. I think #📝general  has more info on when all that stuff goes live


[02-May-18 08:32 AM] enilsen16#0335
Sometime after the mainnet launches I think


[02-May-18 08:33 AM] Synergy#5794
Ah x No worries. Bought in yonks ago and decided to find out what's happening. Appears not much. Until next time then


[02-May-18 08:33 AM] enilsen16#0335
Yeah just follow the medium blog for news


[02-May-18 08:41 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hi guys - yep @enilsen16 is correct (thanks!) just a small rebrand, tokens still viable and you don't need to take any action  


[02-May-18 08:41 AM] arweave-india#5075
Yep tokens will be on an exchange after mainnet launch, which is now just around the corner (8th of June)


[02-May-18 08:43 AM] arweave-india#5075
Yeah we post long and medium-length articles, news, technical info all on Medium (https://medium.com/@arweave) and all updates on Twitter (https://twitter.com/ArweaveTeam)


[02-May-18 08:43 AM] arweave-india#5075
Let me know if you have any questions @Synergy - happy to help!


[02-May-18 08:53 AM] Mike#2447
Can you tell us what exchanges you'll be working with initially?


[02-May-18 08:56 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hi Mike   

We are targeting Kucoin and Okex as centralised exchanges, but we will also be listed on the Bitshares decentralised exchange.


[02-May-18 09:00 AM] Mike#2447
Thanks!


[11-May-18 07:11 AM] Mike#2447
On one of my setups I have multiple blocks with the same block number in my block folder.  Should the system prune the "bad" blocks, or are they just ignored?


[11-May-18 07:12 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
They should be ignored, and eventually pruned


[11-May-18 07:14 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
I should hope anyway! Do let me know it it appears not to be


[11-May-18 07:23 AM] Mike#2447
During this latest round, blocks 1703 through 1715 all have doubles, but they do have different strings after the block number.  So I should just wait and they might eventually delete on their own?  I can also always delete the bad ones manually by checking against my other setups, but that assumes the others are correct.  Are there plans for an online block explorer that will show the "official" blocks?


[11-May-18 07:45 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
No need to do it manually! The server should know which of the blocks are valid and simply won't interact with the ones that are not


[11-May-18 07:45 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
eventually, it should clean up the invalid blocks to make space


[11-May-18 07:51 AM] Mike#2447
Okay, I'll keep an eye on it.


[11-May-18 08:08 AM] Mike#2447
I have another issue/question.  Whenever I start up a new mining session, blocks are downloaded quickly (like several per second) while the system catches up.  Without fail, the system will eventually run into an "error in process" "badrecord, tx" and the download slows to a crawl.  At that point blocks are downloaded at a speed of one every several minutes or slower.  If I close the mining session and start up again, the download picks up again at a fast speed until the badrecord error shows up.  Is there a way to prevent that download slowdown?  Any extra flag to insert in the command string to ignore the error?


[11-May-18 08:39 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
It's jus the way the joining behavior runs in that version, it should be better in the next release


[11-May-18 08:39 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
One second though, I might be able to give you a command so you don't have to reset the server


[11-May-18 08:52 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Okay, if you add a new line below -module(ar_join). in ar_join.erl


[11-May-18 08:52 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
-export([fill_to_capacity/3]).


[11-May-18 08:53 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
you should then be able to run the command:


[11-May-18 08:53 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
ar_join:fill_to_capacity(ar_bridge:get_remote_peers(whereis(http_bridge_node)), whereis(http_entrypoint_node)).


[11-May-18 08:53 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
from the server


[11-May-18 08:53 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
this should resume the fast block collecting behavior


[11-May-18 12:14 PM] Mike#2447
@WillRogerJones I didn't have much luck with this approach.  I added the code you provided, but when I restarted the mining process, it would just crash.  I then tried adding the code to a fresh install before compiling to see if that made a difference and it was the same.  Lastly I tried to change the code while the server was already running/mining and then issue the command you indicated, but there were apparently syntax errors.


[12-May-18 10:01 AM] Blasco#9303
The algorithm for mine AR , it's equihash?  @WillRogerJones


[12-May-18 10:04 AM] Blasco#9303
I read the github, for config the miner, need an http address that it mention in an email. From 7th Nov


[12-May-18 10:07 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Sorry to hear that didn't work out for you Mike - seems to work on my end


[12-May-18 10:08 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
We're planning to push a new version with this fixed fairly soon, hopefully this error will be gone then


[12-May-18 10:09 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
@Blasco, for ease, the addresses are hard coded into this version of the testnet


[12-May-18 10:09 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
But, for ease:

207.154.238.1.1984
165.227.40.8.1984
139.59.81.47.1984


[12-May-18 10:12 AM] Blasco#9303
Ok, it's equihash algo, right?  @WillRogerJones


[12-May-18 10:12 AM] Blasco#9303
Zcl fork


[12-May-18 10:13 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Currently its sha256, though we have some plans to improve upon this


[12-May-18 10:13 AM] Blasco#9303
@WillRogerJones Asic friendly then


[12-May-18 10:14 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Long term, we're strongly considering moving away from an ASIC friendly alg, but obvs SHA is ASIC friendly


[12-May-18 10:14 AM] Blasco#9303
Ok, nice


[12-May-18 10:14 AM] Blasco#9303
Thanks for the info, will try to run the testnet shortly


[12-May-18 10:23 AM] Smilemonk#6703
If it's sha256 then its prone to 51% attack? as my friend told me.

Hey Sam, just wanted to run my issue with the Google plugin by you again. I've tried inputting my public key and saving websites but I get the error "error submitting page". Just want to make sure it works and that my public keys aren't incorrect since I received them months ago.


[13-May-18 12:05 PM] vimal.s08#6053
I'd also like to demonstrate the usefulness of the project to friends especially since I'm a super noob.


[14-May-18 12:39 AM] vimal.s08#6053
Oops just realized u was using an old version of the Google plugin. Got the new one but not sure how to add my public key. Under the options page it says "select a file or drag and drop" under add wallet.


[14-May-18 03:16 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Ah! sorry for the wait. You should be able to either blick on that pane and select the file, or file your keyfile and drag and drop it onto that box


[14-May-18 07:16 AM] CryptoLamer#0730
@everyone Hi, Arweave team! I'm in progress of making review and have some questions for you.

Does arweave support smart contracts?

And if it does how often contracts is created? I mean is it uneconomical to create and update contract for every download and upload of files? How is the payment process going between renter of storage place and the host?

Why are your structure cheaper than in  sea and filecoin for example? I don't quite understand from lightpaper.

Thank You


[14-May-18 12:22 PM] vimal.s08#6053
Hey Will, I only received the public and private key during the presale last year. I don't have a keyfile.


[15-May-18 03:20 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
hi @CryptoLamer , I've got back to you in dev


[15-May-18 03:22 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Hi @vimal.s08, you need to visit your order page and generate a testnet keyfile from it


[15-May-18 03:23 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
You might have to wait until next time we reset the testnet for the wallet associated with the keyfile you generate to be added, though


[16-May-18 12:56 AM] vimal.s08#6053
Ah okay. Not sure how to get back to the order page. When do you plan to reset the testnet next??


[16-May-18 03:17 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
We'll probably do it fairly soon ahead of the main net launch - I don't have an exact date for you yet though


[16-May-18 03:17 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
If you send me a PM, we can work on finding your order page


[18-May-18 04:54 AM] digamma889#3785
@arweave-india any idea on when the KYC via Upvest for the private sale will take place?
You guys must be pretty swamped probably   
The influx on Telegram is amazing!


[18-May-18 06:26 AM] arweave-india#5075
@digamma889 Hi! KYC will be fairly soon - I believe you'll be contacted by email in the next 1-2 weeks to complete KYC for Upvest sale.

We're swamped, but it's amazing to bring the project to so many people  


[29-May-18 08:27 PM] vimal.s08#6053
Is it necessary to hold the json file to access your wallet come.launch? Or can you just hold on to private and public keys.


[30-May-18 02:09 AM] enilsen16#0335
Just the public and private keys (at least to my knowledge)

Is it eqihash or something else. What type of miner can people use. Gpu?


[30-May-18 07:13 AM] Mike#2447
@WillRogerJones Is the IP different from what we received in November?  I've updated to the latest code and don't seem to be connecting when mining via the November IP.  Also, is there a way yet to mine to a particular address?  If so, how is that achieved?  Thanks!


[30-May-18 08:42 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
At the moment, its SHA384


[30-May-18 08:42 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
We're looking to move to a less CPU based algorithm in the future, but we want to be very careful not to disrupt the balance of the network by jumping the gun on this


[30-May-18 08:43 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
384 at least renders specialised hardware no better than fast non-specialised hardware


[30-May-18 08:43 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
@Mike Send me a PM if you'd like to get set up mining

Did you use the fix I described to you before?


[30-May-18 02:38 PM] WillRogerJones#8527
That error message shows up when you dont have the recall block for the current block


[30-May-18 02:40 PM] WillRogerJones#8527
Normally, you'df retrieve an encrypted version of the block and get the key when that block is mined


[30-May-18 02:40 PM] WillRogerJones#8527
Looks like it didn't manage that for you this time, so it'll just be there waiting for the next block


[30-May-18 02:41 PM] WillRogerJones#8527
Ah, also - you're definitely using an old version of the code - we pushed a more user friendly version to master that should let you connect w/ 10 blocks instead of 100

@JP  Miningrigrenrentals.com as a option ?

@JP Arweave is using SHA384 for its mining algorithm and you aren't likely to find any cloud mining services that offer that option.  If you do, let us know.

Is this the list of peers? " 209.97.142.169, 209.97.142.170, 209.97.142.143 "


[07-Jun-18 05:34 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Not us, send me a PM about getting started mining


[07-Jun-18 03:54 PM] JP#7032
@Mike  Got it Mike , in process to find cloudservices ping you once is found , thanks


[07-Jun-18 08:47 PM] xlags#7723
@WillRogerJones can’t send you pm, can you add me?


[07-Jun-18 08:47 PM] xlags#7723
Would like to get started mining


[08-Jun-18 04:36 AM] Cabbie66#4738
Will , how can i get the info needed for mining ?


[08-Jun-18 05:41 AM] tierralibre#2740
which repo should be use for the mainnet launch in 7 hours?


[08-Jun-18 05:41 AM] tierralibre#2740
develop seems to be ahead of master


[08-Jun-18 08:24 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
It'll be on master


[08-Jun-18 08:28 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
We'll release a blog post with details about getting started with mining


[08-Jun-18 08:35 AM] digamma889#3785
@WillRogerJones arweave looking forward to it! I'm ready to start mining


[08-Jun-18 12:40 PM] tierralibre#2740
I am ready to start mining too


[08-Jun-18 12:40 PM] tierralibre#2740
what are the insntructions?


[08-Jun-18 12:40 PM] tierralibre#2740
kind of in the dark in here


[08-Jun-18 12:40 PM] tierralibre#2740
and 19 minutes to go


[08-Jun-18 12:43 PM] tierralibre#2740
@WillRogerJones @arweave-damon @arweave-india  anybody here?


[08-Jun-18 12:43 PM] tierralibre#2740
No email about mining no instructions.


[08-Jun-18 12:43 PM] tierralibre#2740
Can you please help?


[08-Jun-18 12:43 PM] tierralibre#2740
few minutes to go


[08-Jun-18 12:52 PM] Cysop#4020
I'm still getting the error below when I attempt to run arweave. The make clean make all didn't take care of it for me like it did for @tierralibre

[08-Jun-18 12:52 PM] Cysop#4020
Any tips?


[08-Jun-18 12:53 PM] tierralibre#2740
when you do the make are there any errorsR


[08-Jun-18 12:53 PM] tierralibre#2740
?


[08-Jun-18 12:54 PM] Cysop#4020
Nothing I caught while watching it. It seems to make successfully.


[08-Jun-18 12:55 PM] tierralibre#2740
are you on the latest master?


[08-Jun-18 12:56 PM] Cysop#4020
I am


[08-Jun-18 12:56 PM] tierralibre#2740
then I don't know


[08-Jun-18 12:56 PM] Cysop#4020
I appreciate the attempt  


[08-Jun-18 12:56 PM] tierralibre#2740
I had some funny behaviour


[08-Jun-18 12:56 PM] tierralibre#2740
end  up deleting everything


[08-Jun-18 12:56 PM] Cysop#4020
I get the same error when installing erlang from the package, so that's fun.


[08-Jun-18 12:56 PM] tierralibre#2740
and doing a fresh clone


[08-Jun-18 12:56 PM] tierralibre#2740
then make clean


[08-Jun-18 12:56 PM] tierralibre#2740
make


[08-Jun-18 12:57 PM] tierralibre#2740
what os are you?


[08-Jun-18 12:57 PM] Cysop#4020
ubuntu 16.04


[08-Jun-18 12:57 PM] tierralibre#2740
it should work fine in there


[08-Jun-18 12:57 PM] tierralibre#2740
how did you install erlang?


[08-Jun-18 12:57 PM] tierralibre#2740
wget https://packages.erlang-solutions.com/erlang-solutions_1.0_all.deb && sudo dpkg -i erlang-solutions_1.0_all.deb


[08-Jun-18 12:57 PM] Cysop#4020
I started using the quick start script on github:


[08-Jun-18 12:57 PM] tierralibre#2740
sudo apt-get update


[08-Jun-18 12:58 PM] tierralibre#2740
you can try manually

[08-Jun-18 12:58 PM] Cysop#4020
I'll try those packages, thanks


[08-Jun-18 12:58 PM] tierralibre#2740

[08-Jun-18 12:59 PM] tierralibre#2740
it would be nice to get some help here  


[08-Jun-18 01:01 PM] tierralibre#2740
like having a peer list!


[08-Jun-18 01:05 PM] Cysop#4020
Still not working after that package install @tierralibre.


[08-Jun-18 01:05 PM] Cysop#4020
Sigh.


[08-Jun-18 01:07 PM] tierralibre#2740
 


[08-Jun-18 01:07 PM] Cysop#4020
what command are you launching with now @tierralibre


[08-Jun-18 01:07 PM] Cysop#4020
At the moment I'm just trying to launch without arguments


[08-Jun-18 01:07 PM] tierralibre#2740
screen -S ar ./arweave-server


[08-Jun-18 01:11 PM] tierralibre#2740
guys, some help would be great. or visibility of what is going on


[08-Jun-18 01:11 PM] tierralibre#2740
It has been a long day at work and have been preparing this work weeks


[08-Jun-18 01:16 PM] Cysop#4020
To fix my issue, I had to run the following:
```cd archain
erl -make```


[08-Jun-18 01:17 PM] Cysop#4020
the folder ~/archain/ebin was empty.


[08-Jun-18 01:17 PM] Cysop#4020
I suspect that a step needs to be added to the linux quickstart: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jxs1/5e5b3dacb775f8e34fea0a7fc7fa3a69/raw/aafe996b788a30250547aad792094260472b3bfe/install_archain_and_mine.sh


[08-Jun-18 01:18 PM] tierralibre#2740
is building it from source erlang that script


[08-Jun-18 01:18 PM] tierralibre#2740
for ubuntu it would be quicker to install the erlang packages from the official repo


[08-Jun-18 01:18 PM] tierralibre#2740
building erlang can take a while


[08-Jun-18 01:26 PM] Cysop#4020
It is building it from source @tierralibre


[08-Jun-18 01:27 PM] Cysop#4020
there was a version mismatch when I tried to run it using your esl-erlang package, so I'm trying from source again.


[08-Jun-18 01:27 PM] Cysop#4020
I'm wondering if there is a reason why they are using a specific version so it is worth a short again. We're still waiting on mainnet peers, right?


[08-Jun-18 01:28 PM] Mike#2447
Latest GitHub commit was 22 minutes ago, so maybe launch isn't quite ready?

How to mine


[08-Jun-18 01:42 PM] Mike#2447
Once the dev team provides the new peer IP, the command should be:  ./arweave-server mine peer IPADDRESS


[08-Jun-18 01:43 PM] Jinbin Xie Huobi Ventures#2044
How to get the new peer IP？


[08-Jun-18 01:43 PM] Mike#2447
Wait for the announcement.


[08-Jun-18 01:43 PM] Cysop#4020
current error:
```{error,{bad_lib,"Library version (2.13) not compatible (with 2.12)."}```


[08-Jun-18 01:44 PM] Cysop#4020
for jiffy. Wheeee.


[08-Jun-18 01:46 PM] Mike#2447
@Cysop  Try running  "make clean"  then  "make all"  and see if that make the error stop.


[08-Jun-18 01:46 PM] arweave-india#5075
Hi guys - yes @Mike is right we'll be announcing the new IPs soon


[08-Jun-18 01:46 PM] tierralibre#2740
is soon 10 minutes 1 hour

@Mike I was running that in the otp_src_20.1 folder before. I bet you are asking me to run that in the archain folder aren't you.


[08-Jun-18 01:47 PM] tierralibre#2740
yes arweave folder

In case you haven't seen it yet, this is the most recent set of instructions on how to get mining : https://medium.com/@arweave/batn-2-archiving-the-internet-3b0311ea8311 

The IP addresses mentioned in that post will be announced later today (although previously they were backer-exclusive, now they will be public for mainnet)

@tierralibre @Mike Thank you, that did it.


[08-Jun-18 01:48 PM] arweave-india#5075
@tierralibre I don't have a specific set time for the IP publication, no


[08-Jun-18 01:48 PM] Mike#2447
@Cysop Great!


[08-Jun-18 01:49 PM] Cysop#4020
@arweave-india Adding the following lines to the end of the ubuntu quickstart script should get everything working I believe:
```cd archain
erl -make
make clean
make all
cd ../```


[08-Jun-18 02:17 PM] Cysop#4020
How do we tell if mining is working when pointed at one of the backer IPs?


[08-Jun-18 02:17 PM] Cysop#4020
What should the output look like?


[08-Jun-18 03:40 PM] tierralibre#2740
has anybody managed to connect the network?


[08-Jun-18 03:43 PM] Cysop#4020
My VM has maxed out its CPU assigned to it, and I have the below in the log. It looks like I'm connected, though without the mainnet IPs I'm sure I'm not talking to the actual network.

@Cysop What command did you run to start mining?


[08-Jun-18 03:51 PM] Cysop#4020
I have it wrapped up in a shell script with some variables, but I'm effectively running this: 
```./arweave-server peer 209.XXX.XXX.XXX mine```

No IP's have been released.


[09-Jun-18 06:59 AM] enti#1418
that's CPU mining only ?


[09-Jun-18 07:08 AM] Bicepsueel#6532
No need to heavy special hardware right?


[09-Jun-18 07:08 AM] Bicepsueel#6532
So many questions haha


[09-Jun-18 07:08 AM] Bicepsueel#6532
Let's just wait for a proper guide

When guide ?  When listing ?  When mining ? When moon ? Haha


[09-Jun-18 07:14 AM] enti#1418
@Cysop may I receive the peer IP by PM ? didn't receive the email


[09-Jun-18 07:58 AM] Mike#2447
I don't believe anyone has received information.  Although the website indicates they are up to block 488, so someone is mining.  Probably the dev team still just making sure everything is good to go.

What's that?


[09-Jun-18 08:29 AM] tierralibre#2740
The network production stats


[09-Jun-18 08:30 AM] tierralibre#2740
so currently 61 peers


[09-Jun-18 08:31 AM] tierralibre#2740
not sure if anybody aside from the arweave team are on the network though


[09-Jun-18 08:31 AM] Bicepsueel#6532
Which means? This will be my very first project with mining, ever. I have much to learn.


[09-Jun-18 09:27 AM] JP#7032
Hi arweave team  what would be a profitable set up for arweave , invest on S9 antminers kind of rigs , or Most important highspeed Harddisks tb#?, bandwidth speed?  etc , can please share what would be a Average Joe investment profitable setup , in other words if I want to buy new equipment where should my investment go recommended from you for best performance ?


[09-Jun-18 10:43 AM] Jinbin Xie Huobi Ventures#2044
What's the peer IP？


[09-Jun-18 11:28 AM] enti#1418
yeah wondering the same   compilation went through


[09-Jun-18 11:35 AM] arweave-india#5075
Yep @Mike you're spot on


[09-Jun-18 11:36 AM] arweave-india#5075
We're adding more info gradually as we go to give you guys more feedback on the progress of the network


[09-Jun-18 11:36 AM] arweave-india#5075
No one has been given special access to mining or anything yet


[09-Jun-18 11:36 AM] arweave-india#5075
The first guide to mining will go out via our mining mailing list in the coming days!

If you haven't already, drop me an email at india@arweave.org to get your preferred email added to the mining mailing list


[09-Jun-18 11:41 AM] tierralibre#2740
Thank you! @arweave-india "The first guide to mining will go out via our mining mailing list in the coming days!" this makes it very clear.

@enti I'm "mining" on the test IPs sent to backers. I'm not comfortable giving them out, but it seems like something that @arweave-india might be comfortable giving out at this point, since the mainnet mining release is so close.


[10-Jun-18 05:32 AM] flamesx#4524
Can anyone tell me what do POA and ADR%/node mean? thanks


[10-Jun-18 10:06 AM] liu#5081
anyone?


[10-Jun-18 10:07 AM] liu#5081
is ther anyone?


[10-Jun-18 04:43 PM] blockchainlauren#4846
anyone receive their tokens yet?


[11-Jun-18 07:40 AM] arweave-india#5075
@blockchainlauren A small number of people have received their tokens, but many have yet to generate their wallets. We'll be continually sending out batches of tokens to token holders who have passed KYC over the coming days


[11-Jun-18 07:41 AM] arweave-india#5075
And after those batches are complete, tokens will become transferable


[11-Jun-18 07:42 AM] Patziggy#9371
Anyone know if the wallet is downloadable anywhere other than email? I never recieved mine despite KYC completion 🤷


[11-Jun-18 01:21 PM] BBM#0001
Hi @arweave-india , as part of KYC am I able to use my driving license as proof of identity as well as address or do you need two separate docs?


[11-Jun-18 01:21 PM] arweave-india#5075
Okay driving licence as ID documentation should be fine, but yes sadly we have to ask for two different documents for ID vs proof of address


[11-Jun-18 01:22 PM] arweave-india#5075
For the address document you can use something like a utility bill, bank statement, etc.

You can blur out sensitive information on the document - but we just need to see the name and address

When creating a new wallet keyfile, is that wallet address the portion of text that appears after "arweave_keyfile_" and before ".json" ?


[12-Jun-18 08:02 AM] pikatju#6858
When I log into upvest theres just a blank page


[12-Jun-18 08:02 AM] pikatju#6858
its like theres nothing there


[12-Jun-18 08:02 AM] NewbieFT#9201
That’s what I get too


[12-Jun-18 08:02 AM] pikatju#6858
is the upvest site down?


[12-Jun-18 08:04 AM] NewbieFT#9201
Must be


[12-Jun-18 08:09 AM] pikatju#6858
This has been quite a bad ICO


[12-Jun-18 08:32 AM] Mike#2447
@pikatju What do you think has gone bad?


[12-Jun-18 08:40 AM] pikatju#6858
Ok so I got the Arweave tokens but there is no withdraw


[12-Jun-18 08:40 AM] blockchainlauren#4846
lol


[12-Jun-18 08:40 AM] pikatju#6858
any exchange?


[12-Jun-18 08:40 AM] pikatju#6858
I think this upvest site is super shady


[12-Jun-18 08:41 AM] pikatju#6858
they could run away with everything and i cant even get my tokens


[12-Jun-18 08:57 AM] Marcin#0065
Same feeling for me. I will get out all tokens as soon i can. I really hope a ledger wallet support will arrive soon


[12-Jun-18 09:39 AM] pikatju#6858
Ya I dont get the point of getting a wallet with no withdraw function


[12-Jun-18 09:39 AM] pikatju#6858
I want the tokens in my private hold asap


[12-Jun-18 09:48 AM] Bicepsueel#6532
Same


[13-Jun-18 02:12 PM] information-corp#0984
@arweave-india  i received an email for only part of the tokens i purchased


[13-Jun-18 02:12 PM] information-corp#0984
do you have the presale eth and btc addresses?


[14-Jun-18 03:49 AM] Maurice#3196
@information-corp Same here. I did not write down the ETH address that I sent funds to, now I cannot find the transaction in the haystack. @arweave-india  please DM address.


[14-Jun-18 08:43 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hey guys @information-corp and @Maurice Please do feel free to PM me or email me at india@arweave.org, I'd be very happy to help


[14-Jun-18 08:43 AM] arweave-india#5075
@pikatju There will soon be an Arweave-specific wallet that you can transfer your funds to if you don't wish to continue using Upvest


[25-Jun-18 12:33 AM] NewbieFT#9201
@Unknown You have been reported


[25-Jun-18 12:34 AM] NewbieFT#9201
because you sent me transaction, I know your address and KYC info


[25-Jun-18 12:34 AM] NewbieFT#9201

The status of one of my archival transactions says not found.

Transaction ID: txwkIFs9m7QGFGoZjGSe00OHDNmYGnOk1OmSfK3bup4


[26-Jun-18 01:12 PM] vimal.s08#6053
Anyone able to help out with my last two issues?


[26-Jun-18 03:01 PM] tierralibre#2740
I am playing with the new wallet.


[26-Jun-18 03:03 PM] tierralibre#2740
I am little confused of how it works. When you click archive arweave sends the current page?


[26-Jun-18 03:03 PM] tierralibre#2740
Is there no way to upload any data? I guess navigating to a local file?


[26-Jun-18 03:04 PM] tierralibre#2740
and how do we know the cost? before confirming the upload?


[26-Jun-18 04:02 PM] tierralibre#2740
So I have tried to archive a page. I opened a local file which contained a text, clicked on the archive button.  I get the message "Submitting your transaction to the network.

This may take a moment." but just stays there, it has been over 30", is this the correct behaviour?


[26-Jun-18 04:02 PM] vimal.s08#6053
Go to options. Is there a red or orange band next to the page your archiving?


[26-Jun-18 04:03 PM] tierralibre#2740
where in options?


[26-Jun-18 04:03 PM] tierralibre#2740
I see no band of any kind


[26-Jun-18 04:03 PM] vimal.s08#6053
Underneath transactions.


[26-Jun-18 04:04 PM] vimal.s08#6053
In the wallet.


[26-Jun-18 04:04 PM] tierralibre#2740
underneath transactions there is nothing


[26-Jun-18 04:04 PM] vimal.s08#6053
Refresh the page.


[26-Jun-18 04:04 PM] vimal.s08#6053
Has your AR balance dropped?


[26-Jun-18 04:04 PM] tierralibre#2740
still nothing after refresh


[26-Jun-18 04:04 PM] tierralibre#2740
not it did not drop


[26-Jun-18 04:04 PM] vimal.s08#6053
Then it didn't go through.


[26-Jun-18 04:05 PM] vimal.s08#6053
You should see a transaction popup saying pending.


[26-Jun-18 04:05 PM] tierralibre#2740
none of that happened


[26-Jun-18 04:05 PM] vimal.s08#6053
And a orange band.


[26-Jun-18 04:05 PM] vimal.s08#6053
And once it's archived it switches to green.


[26-Jun-18 04:05 PM] tierralibre#2740
to me that does not happen


[26-Jun-18 04:05 PM] vimal.s08#6053
Try again.


[26-Jun-18 04:06 PM] vimal.s08#6053
Since your balance hasn't changed.


[26-Jun-18 04:06 PM] tierralibre#2740
Flow is:


[26-Jun-18 04:06 PM] tierralibre#2740
1) load local file


[26-Jun-18 04:06 PM] tierralibre#2740
2) click archive


[26-Jun-18 04:06 PM] tierralibre#2740
3) message "Submitting your transaction to the network.

This may take a moment." appears


[26-Jun-18 04:07 PM] tierralibre#2740
and it just hangs there


[26-Jun-18 04:07 PM] vimal.s08#6053
Hmm not sure. Team will need to help you.


[26-Jun-18 04:07 PM] vimal.s08#6053
Once I submit it asks for my password. Then gives me a link.


[26-Jun-18 04:07 PM] tierralibre#2740
thank you @vimal.s08


[26-Jun-18 04:07 PM] vimal.s08#6053
Which updates to the archived page after awhile.


[26-Jun-18 04:07 PM] vimal.s08#6053
Np


[26-Jun-18 04:17 PM] vimal.s08#6053
Any chance you're on the testnet app?


[26-Jun-18 04:17 PM] vimal.s08#6053
I'm not technical btw haha.


[26-Jun-18 04:20 PM] tierralibre#2740
no, I am in prod network


[26-Jun-18 04:33 PM] tierralibre#2740
ok. I think is because it is a local file.


[26-Jun-18 04:33 PM] tierralibre#2740
I upload a file to github and archive it from there, then it worked fine   Really nice to see this working  


[27-Jun-18 01:14 PM] arweave-india#5075
@tierralibre Great to hear!


[27-Jun-18 01:14 PM] arweave-india#5075

I went and archived some webpages. I  logged out of the account using the remove data button. When I log in again. All data is gone. I dont think this is a good interface. You guys should provide a logout button that doesnt require delete all data.


[28-Jun-18 01:28 PM] vimal.s08#6053
Np India.


[02-Jul-18 06:01 AM] arweave-india#5075
@flamesx I hear you, thank you for the feedback, I'll pass it on. This is something we are already in discussion about within the team, but I'll add your feedback to the mix.


[02-Jul-18 07:40 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @flamesx, just so we can properly address your use case can I ask what driving this? Is it more concern about somebody else gaining access and being able to run transactions from your machine? Do you just not want to leave your key if you're not actively using the extension? Is there maybe some other concern or thoughts?


[02-Jul-18 07:41 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
It's something that's been mentioned a couple of times so I'm just trying to get some more user feedback, thanks


[02-Jul-18 08:43 AM] flamesx#4524
My main concern is accident. For example, if my PC crashes and I need to reinstall chrome. I have to reinstall Arweave as well. Hence all my archive is not stored on the extension anymore. It is inconvenient if you can’t have a way to keep the archive in the extension. In addition, I think it is a good idea to be able to log in to a wallet from mutiple devices. I am guessing that I can’t access the archive link from second device, maybe I am wrong. Haven’t tried yet


[02-Jul-18 09:10 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Ahhhh, okay. So all data is currently stored locally, so multiple devices aren't supported. We're looking at changing this and moving to pulling all data from the network, so this will be supported in future though, and the scenario you described where your PC crashes and you need to reinstall it should also be resolved by this too


[02-Jul-18 09:11 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Anyone can use the archive links though. So if you grab the URL from the transactions page, anyone can view that data if you send them the link, they don't need the extension or anything, just the URL.


[02-Jul-18 09:12 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Thanks for the feedback @flamesx


[03-Jul-18 06:44 AM] flamesx#4524

[14-Jul-18 09:23 AM] bitcoinBeliever&30k_by_2020#6947
hi，any minimum requirement for hard drive space?


[14-Jul-18 09:41 AM] Mike#2447
Considering that the network has been up for about a month with very low usage and the weave is already about 25GB, I think users should be planning on double digit TB of space.  Once people actually start using Arweave, we'll be needing triple digit TB.  This is just my opinion, but there is no minimum.  Users should go as big as possible and plan ahead for expansion.


[14-Jul-18 01:33 PM] bitcoinBeliever&30k_by_2020#6947
thanks


[15-Jul-18 08:05 AM] bitcoinBeliever&30k_by_2020#6947
@Mike hi, I am noob, I have question about the decentralized storage. Are those file all have a copy in the miners computer, would that cause a big problem for the decentralization, as most users won't have such large hard drive space


[15-Jul-18 09:53 AM] ATLAS#7218
Thats the point of blockweave. You don't need the whole blockweave to mine.


[15-Jul-18 12:00 PM] bitcoinBeliever&30k_by_2020#6947
@ATLAS then you mean the file are partially distributed around the network?


[15-Jul-18 12:01 PM] bitcoinBeliever&30k_by_2020#6947
I didn't quite understand it, if not all the data have a copy on each miners computer


[15-Jul-18 12:01 PM] bitcoinBeliever&30k_by_2020#6947
How will the data distributed?


[15-Jul-18 12:01 PM] arweave-india#5075
@bitcoinBeliever&30k_by_2020 If you like you can read more in our lightpaper or in our explanatory Medium blog be post. I'll just grab links for you now

[15-Jul-18 12:05 PM] arweave-india#5075
In short though Elegy is correct - you do not need the whole chain to successfully mine on the network. To learn a bit more about the differences between a blockchain and our blockweave, I'd recommend the links above  


[15-Jul-18 12:12 PM] ATLAS#7218
Data will be "distributed" to the miners who are willing to store that data.


[15-Jul-18 12:13 PM] ATLAS#7218
So if noone among the miners want certain block, it will go missing.


[15-Jul-18 12:13 PM] bitcoinBeliever&30k_by_2020#6947
Yes, that's the potential problem


[15-Jul-18 12:13 PM] ATLAS#7218
To prevent such missing cases, there is a reward incentive. Read the paper for more details


[15-Jul-18 12:14 PM] bitcoinBeliever&30k_by_2020#6947
Oh, that's cool


[15-Jul-18 12:14 PM] bitcoinBeliever&30k_by_2020#6947
I just came out the question in my mind and u answered me

[18-Jul-18 08:25 PM] Căpitanu#5971
How can I see the balance of my wallet?
And how can I set a limit on resource usage?


[19-Jul-18 04:33 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @Căpitanu , you can load your key file into the web extension wallet https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/arweave-client/iplppiggblloelhoglpmkmbinggcaaoc


[19-Jul-18 04:33 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
This will show you the balance, we have a block explorer coming soon so when that's out you'll be able to check balances on there without key files


[19-Jul-18 04:34 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Regarding resource limits, are you interested in disk space or CPU limiting?


[19-Jul-18 07:09 AM] Căpitanu#5971
I am interested in BOTH CPU and disk space limiting - thank you for answering


[19-Jul-18 07:11 AM] Căpitanu#5971
also.. My balance is 0 after some 24h of running the miner


[19-Jul-18 11:13 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
@Căpitanu there's a `disk_space` argument you can pass when you start your node, just add the max amount of GB you want to use e.g. `disk_space 10` if you wanted to use a max of 10GB. So in context the full startup command would look something like `./arweave-server mine peer xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx disk_space 10`.


[19-Jul-18 11:14 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Regarding CPU the software will currently use the number of cores on your machine - 1, so on a 4 (logical) core machine the software will try to use up 3 of those cores, so you'll see something close to 100% usage on a typical node when you're mining. This is something we'll likely add as a configurable value in future releases, similar to how the max disk space is configurable


[19-Jul-18 11:16 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
On your node @Căpitanu , does the log show that you're mining any blocks yet? Keep in mind your node will need to have pulled enough blocks so that you've gone some of the recall blocks, if you don't have the current recall block your node won't be able to participate in mining the next block


[19-Jul-18 12:42 PM] Mike#2447
The HTTP command  "/wallet/[wallet_address]/last_tx" does not seem to be working.  Can anyone confirm?


[19-Jul-18 01:09 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
What’s the full url you’re trying? Have you got an example


[19-Jul-18 01:09 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
If the wallet_address format is wrong that might produce an error


[19-Jul-18 01:17 PM] Mike#2447
I just picked the first wallet listed on the Amazon stats page.  You can insert your favorite peer IP.
XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:1984/wallet/AALDzozHbK7uObDovdA83hRZ8CyyJ_A3GU8HUN55vPQ/last_tx


[19-Jul-18 02:22 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
I just checked it against one of our nodes and seems to work fine


[19-Jul-18 02:22 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
What are you seeing?


[19-Jul-18 02:23 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
Oh it's blank response with a HTTP 200 status code if that's what you're seeing? That's the expected response if the wallet has no transactions yet


[19-Jul-18 02:32 PM] Mike#2447
Yes, I'm seeing blank response when checking against my current mining address.  It has a balance, so it's seen transactions, but only TX fee deposits not wallet-to-wallet transfers.


[19-Jul-18 02:33 PM] Mike#2447
I checked a wallet address with a deposit from another wallet and the command works.


[19-Jul-18 03:01 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
Yeah that endpoint only shows the last outgoing transaction from the wallet, so any transfers to it won't show up on the `/last_tx`

This is the type of info I get in my log. Seems to me it is currently only writing . Perhaps I've simply been connecting to a single peer and downloading from them? I tried copying all of the script received via e-mail into my bash window instead of running a .bat file with the instructions


[20-Jul-18 04:39 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
@Căpitanu that's normal, your node will continually be writing blocks to disk until it's downloaded as many as it can, if you started in the last few days the block height was about 20k so until that initial batch have been downloaded you'll see this continual writing of blocks in the background


[20-Jul-18 04:39 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
More blocks (potential recall blocks) means you're able to participate in mining more future blocks, so you should see more mining activity as you store more and more of the weave


[20-Jul-18 06:17 PM] 2072 [ANFRA]#9291
Are there any command you can type while mining to check the current state or do other thing? I see that I get a prompt "1>" if i hit enter while the logs are displayed


[20-Jul-18 06:17 PM] 2072 [ANFRA]#9291
Also how do you cleanly exit the miner?


[21-Jul-18 02:00 AM] Dentechr#5213
open a new terminal, go to same folder and type 'make log'

ctrl + c to exit (correct me if i am wrong)

[26-Jul-18 02:29 AM] arthur#6010
Just to make sure, when the miner creates a wallet this is enough to do transactions, there is no private key and public key like in ethereum?


[26-Jul-18 03:33 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @arthur There’s just one key file which is in the JSON Web Key format, it contains the elements for both the public and private key in just one file. It’s actually possible to derive normal public/private key files from the JWK if you reeeeeally wanted


[26-Jul-18 03:35 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
You can simply copy the key file created by the miner into the chrome extension, then see the balance and send the AR elsewhere. Nothing else required.

Hey @2072 [ANFRA] , thanks for reporting the details and log. This is an outstanding issue IIRC and a fix is being worked on. As a temporary fix you could increase the space quota if possible. Worth keeping in mind we're still in the soft-onboarding process at the moment, so there aren't many mining rewards just yet


[01-Aug-18 03:51 PM] 2072 [ANFRA]#9291
Thanks @arweave-kyle, I don't see any related open issue on Github (https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/issues ) Should I create one with the above log?

FYI, I had a VM miner experience an out of memory error, although it is currently allocated 8GB of memory.  Arweave indicated it was to automatically restart, which did not happen.  The erl_crash.dump file is 3.3GB, so I can't exactly share that.  The log doesn't seem to show anything interesting.

I thought it would be notable as the recommended minimum amount of memory is 8GB.

Hey, I have a problem with the web extension wallet,. I keept my AR there and just go on holiday. Now after I'm back the wallet show 0 balance? In the archive there is no transaction , the last I made was a month ago from upvest. Is there any possibility I can check the balance on the blockchain, is it something wrong with the wallet at this point?


[15-Aug-18 01:19 PM] Mike#2447
You should be able to visit this link (or use other peer IP of your choice)  and get your balance.
http://159.65.213.43:1984/wallet/WALLETADDRESS/balance


[15-Aug-18 01:21 PM] Mike#2447
Unfortunately there seems to be some network issue at the moment as my wallets are also reporting zero balance.


[16-Aug-18 08:52 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @Mike @CryptoGrinch, this should have been resolved now. There was an issues late yesterday afternoon where some of the nodes serving traffic for the chrome wallet became unsynced temporarily, it wasn't a network wide issue. They've been restarted and resynced and have resumed normal operations


[02-Sep-18 02:38 PM] TolerableTrader#4148
how does one know what the wallet address is. I created one finally getting this going but shutdown to add more drives, I want to get it going again and it terminates.  I have a file in my wallet folder starts with arweave_keyfile_ and then a gibberish string. is that the wallet address? opening up the file shows more gibberish.


[02-Sep-18 03:04 PM] Mike#2447
You are correct @TolerableTrader the gibberish string is the wallet address.

Hi @fbox5 , you can indeed!


[28-Sep-18 03:12 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You can start your own private weave by running `arweave-server init mine`, then have other peers join it by running `arweave-server peer [origin node IP address] mine`


[28-Sep-18 03:13 AM] arweave-sam#9630
What is the project about? We would be happy to help out wherever we can.

did you ever stress test? how many tx/s can the system handle?


[02-Oct-18 09:21 AM] tiamat#9131
what is hash_lists directory?


[02-Oct-18 07:11 PM] arweave-sam#9630
The hash lists directory contains dumps of lists of the independent hashes of every block in the network. One for each execution of the Arweave miner. They are mostly there for safely purposes and can be safely deleted by individual miners, as you download the block hash list from trusted peers each time you join the net anyway.


[02-Oct-18 07:27 PM] Vilenarios#8742
As a miner if I already have, let’s say, 500gb of mp3s am I incentivized to host that on arweave or will I have to pay to have the files hosted?


[02-Oct-18 07:28 PM] arweave-sam#9630
You have to pay to add data to the weave


[02-Oct-18 07:28 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Could there be a tool to convert locally stored content directly to blocks?


[02-Oct-18 07:29 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Miners are incentivised to store data already on the net


[02-Oct-18 07:29 PM] arweave-sam#9630
A basic file uploader? Absolutely


[02-Oct-18 07:29 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Got it. So I’d have to pay to store it on the arweave but then I could in theory delete the original mp3s since I’m also storing it as a miner


[02-Oct-18 07:30 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We have a GUI one coming, and I believe Upvest made a command line one, too


[02-Oct-18 07:30 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Assuming you are running a full node, yes :)


[02-Oct-18 07:32 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Yes a full node for sure. And depending on rewards potentially several nodes. I just want to make sure I can also store my own data on arweave. Definitely got important files but not sure if cost effective to store full music or picture libraries yet.


[02-Oct-18 07:32 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Will eventually compare cost of storage in AR to like OneDrive for business or other file storage tools.


[02-Oct-18 07:33 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Storing music in OneDrive for business at 99 bucks a year adds up over decades when Arweave is forever right?  


[02-Oct-18 07:33 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Indeed


[02-Oct-18 07:34 PM] arweave-sam#9630

The main IP address, 159.65.213.43, is currently 503 Service Unavailable, which also means the Chrome Wallet extension isn't working at the moment.


[05-Oct-18 01:15 AM] tiamat#9131
we need some backup solution for that, it's not good if everything relies on a single ip, it is not decentralization


[05-Oct-18 02:30 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Agreed @tiamat . The next version of the web extension uses variable hosts, as well as supporting the user specifying their own preferred node to talk to.


[05-Oct-18 02:30 PM] arweave-sam#9630
The situation with the load balancer in question has now been resolved.


[05-Oct-18 02:39 PM] arweave-sam#9630
(For those interested: There was a change to how the LB host detected whether a node was 'up', which led to it misinterpreting the ~7 nodes behind the balancer as 'down'. This change wasn't made clear to us so it took a while to identify the cause of the issue. Thanks for your patience, all!)


[05-Oct-18 02:40 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Classic mistake. Gotta have the right kind of load balancer health checks.


[05-Oct-18 02:41 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Usually a ping to the back end hosts doesn’t cut it.


[05-Oct-18 02:41 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Glad to hear it’s all fixed up.


[05-Oct-18 02:48 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yeah, they changed the method of determining liveness without mentioning it in any change logs. They used to GET the address you specified, but now they HEAD


[05-Oct-18 02:49 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Which is a nice change (don't want to serve the body if you don't have to), but some warning would have been nice :P.


[05-Oct-18 02:49 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Either way, highlights the importance of the variable nodes change in the next version of the web ext

Hi all, I’m just trying to get this running on Mac and it’s falling over when I try to launch the miner.  It’s falling over at cd lib/jiffy && .rebar compile &&...


[15-Oct-18 03:14 PM] bonkingbob#6212
Can anybody help? A bit of a Linux terminal noob so bear with me!


[15-Oct-18 03:15 PM] bonkingbob#6212
Saying no file or directory


[15-Oct-18 05:42 PM] Marcin#0065
Dave, you probably just downloaded a rc version?
Try to get the main arweave folder from github unpacked at ur fav location. After that paste the rc2 folder into it. Replace and merge all whats needed.
Try then again. Youre probably missing the rebar2 files to build up.


[15-Oct-18 05:48 PM] bonkingbob#6212
I followed the guide on the email I got today. I’ll  give it a look again tomorrow cheers


[15-Oct-18 06:12 PM] cromulon#5411
is anyone running the miner in a cloud based environment?


[15-Oct-18 06:13 PM] patrick#8648
@cromulon not yet, looking into the feasibility of it tho


[15-Oct-18 06:19 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Rush, I’ve set it up in Azure IaaS


[15-Oct-18 06:20 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Pretty straight forward. You could probably take snapshots of your VMs after blocks have synced and stamp out new copies. Just need to make sure you setup your network policies to allow ssh on port 22 to your own IP and port 1984 to any IP.


[15-Oct-18 06:21 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Pretty sure it won’t be cost effective to host in the cloud, unless AR price sky rockets.


[15-Oct-18 06:22 PM] patrick#8648
ya depends on how much you want topay. Is Azure that cost effective? DO is not bad imo


[15-Oct-18 06:24 PM] Vilenarios#8742
If you don’t have space or don’t want to heat of a miner, then cloud may be the way to go. But getting instances with a lot of cpus will get expensive quick.


[15-Oct-18 06:24 PM] patrick#8648
what's your setup vilenarios, if you don't mind me asking?


[15-Oct-18 06:26 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I only did some basic tests with a standard F2s instance type, which is a linux GM optimized for compute with 2cpu and 4gb ram.


[15-Oct-18 06:27 PM] Vilenarios#8742
6 cents an hour. About 45 bucks a month


[15-Oct-18 06:27 PM] patrick#8648
okok DO has a 16gb ram 320GB SSD for 80/month - now i know the storage is not huge, but you can start mining with such a setup


[15-Oct-18 06:28 PM] Vilenarios#8742
So compare that to my mining rig. Which has 24 cores  I paid 700 or so for the intel chip and figure it’s like 30 bucks a month for power.


[15-Oct-18 06:29 PM] Vilenarios#8742
So if I wanted that same number of cores in Azure it’d be 12 of those VMs, and probably be upwards of 500 bucks a month.


[15-Oct-18 06:29 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I was going to put together a spreadsheet on costs and hash power between different specs, just haven’t had the time.


[15-Oct-18 06:30 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Oh that 6 cents an hour is based on a 3 year contract,,, if you do pay as you go it’s 17 cents an hour for the same type!


[15-Oct-18 06:31 PM] Vilenarios#8742
But there are other benefits to the cloud, like better network connectivity, backup/restore, analytics etc.


[15-Oct-18 06:32 PM] patrick#8648
yea -- cloud is a good start imo, then one can start investing in hardware


[15-Oct-18 06:32 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Definitely - can literally start mining in 15 mins.


[15-Oct-18 06:34 PM] patrick#8648
if you have enough recall blocks :p


[15-Oct-18 06:38 PM] cromulon#5411

[16-Oct-18 01:47 PM] Joel#5880
'Generate' new wallet, then 'Load' the wallet file, which will give you the option to create a password and 'Save'. This will be the password you use for archiving transactions. Once you've done that, you should see your wallet address.

Once content is written to the blockweave can it be modified? Or must a new file be written?


[17-Oct-18 02:08 AM] tiamat#9131
It's one of the main ideas that it can't be modified, it's permanent.


[17-Oct-18 02:33 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep, you would have to write a new transaction into the ledger. For bigger files with smaller changes though we expect people will submit 'patch' transactions, that link back to the original. This allows the client to build the modified file and saves the uploader some AR.


[17-Oct-18 02:38 AM] tiamat#9131
I have seen a paper comparing Arweave with Sia and Storj, but how about Bluzelle? Did you guys look into that?

I have not seen that @Vilenarios


[29-Oct-18 06:12 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Normally this kind of event would imply that your node has run out of memory, or you have encountered a bug with the Erlang VM itself (most likely due to some issue with your OS/hardware combination). How are you running the node in question?


[29-Oct-18 06:13 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I have been running Windows 10 with WSL


[29-Oct-18 06:13 AM] Vilenarios#8742
It’s been impossible to run an internal polling node.


[29-Oct-18 06:15 AM] Vilenarios#8742
When I peer to my dmz node it never stays in sync and is constantly behind. Been troubleshooting like crazy and nothing seems to fix or reduce network latency.


[29-Oct-18 06:15 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I would think 2 nodes on the same network would pretty good transfer rate...


[29-Oct-18 06:18 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Maybe i need full Ubuntu


[29-Oct-18 06:19 AM] arweave-sam#9630
When you say internal polling mode, you do you mean a firewalled node, polling against a DMZ node, which is connected normally to the outside?


[29-Oct-18 06:19 AM] arweave-sam#9630
And you are having trouble with the internal (firewalled) node keeping up with the outside net?


[29-Oct-18 06:21 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Ya - node A is in dmz and has a public IP. I join the arweave network and it will be fine. Stays up to date and network latency spikes to 150k during mining/forks.


[29-Oct-18 06:21 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Node B is in polling mode, is peered with Node A only, nothing else.


[29-Oct-18 06:21 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Node B continually is behind, and then eventually seems to cause Node A to go behind


[29-Oct-18 06:24 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Even if Node A doesn’t mine, Node B still falls behind.


[29-Oct-18 07:00 AM] Mike#2447
I have a similar setup with a single DMZ node and two other internal network nodes.  I have found best results in just peering the internal nodes with standard arweave peers and running with polling.  I have tried multiple configurations and that seems to work best for me.


[29-Oct-18 09:03 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Thanks Mike - glad someone else validates my experience.  I wasnt sure if i had to start troubleshooting my routers and what not...    I will leave it in polling mode but connect to external peers for now and see how it goes....


[29-Oct-18 09:14 AM] Mike#2447
My biggest gripe is that the results seem inconsistent and difficult to troubleshoot.  Like sometimes the latency is 50k and sometimes it's 200k, but I can't see anything on my end changing.  There is still some lag from time to time, but for the most part when I check the internal nodes now, they are staying current.


[29-Oct-18 09:16 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Yeah - it makes it hard for me to decide if i want to invest in more miners... I certainly dont if each non-public IP miner is inherently gimped.


[29-Oct-18 09:36 AM] tiamat#9131
what's the correlation between "network":"arweave.N.1","version":3,"release":15" and N.1.5.0.0-RC-5 ?


[29-Oct-18 02:27 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Im seeing 0 balance, old balances, or up to date balance via chrome wallet extension.  Is something up with that load balancer?


[30-Oct-18 04:29 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I think that there was temporarily an issue with one of the nodes behind the LB. I checked last night but couldn't repeat it.

Thanks for reporting!


[01-Nov-18 02:40 AM] tiamat#9131
can we set the wallet which node to use? we can't rely on LB + it's centralized


[01-Nov-18 09:59 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@tiamat Yep! It is included in the new version of the web extension

Alright, thanks for the info @patrick


[02-Nov-18 12:47 AM] patrick#8648
sorry it has to be this way @awkweird  has happened to me A LOT


[02-Nov-18 12:47 AM] awkweird#6550
Ive just found out ip:1984/wallet/addr/balance is the best way to check the balance


[02-Nov-18 12:48 AM] patrick#8648
well it depends. Because that is checking the balance from your own node


[02-Nov-18 12:48 AM] patrick#8648
now if your node is on a fork


[02-Nov-18 12:48 AM] patrick#8648
and it seems like u are getting lots of arweave


[02-Nov-18 12:48 AM] patrick#8648
it can be misleading too


[02-Nov-18 12:48 AM] awkweird#6550
Oh wow


[02-Nov-18 12:49 AM] patrick#8648
ya wait at least 3-4 blocks before you can say that you "won" the block


[02-Nov-18 12:49 AM] awkweird#6550
So the best way is to wait a bit


[02-Nov-18 12:49 AM] awkweird#6550
Haha


[02-Nov-18 12:49 AM] patrick#8648
ya lol


[02-Nov-18 12:49 AM] patrick#8648
such is life with POW blockchains


[02-Nov-18 12:50 AM] awkweird#6550
True, but its worth being a part of the great project


[02-Nov-18 12:50 AM] awkweird#6550

reboot? restarting the process is enough

[02-Nov-18 04:47 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Reboot takes 20 seconds so I figure why the hell not.  Still though, I’m not sure if there is any possible way to get memory management on it.


[02-Nov-18 04:49 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Wondering if this is a Windows subsystem for Linux problem only.


[02-Nov-18 08:22 AM] arweave-india#5075
@2072 [ANFRA] Thanks for reporting - this appears to be resolved now? I just tried to archive the same page in safe mode and it worked fine this time around. Let me know if you're still having issues! FYI, love your choice of page to archive  


[02-Nov-18 08:29 AM] kevint#5113
I'm using  the Windows Linux Subsystem, but I'm not sure where the Arweave directory resides to finish the setup


[02-Nov-18 08:47 AM] Mike#2447
@kevint It should be this:  C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\LocalState\rootfs\home\USERNAME\arweave


[02-Nov-18 08:48 AM] Mike#2447
Beware, if you fiddle with the Linux folders/files using Windows, they may become corrupted.  All work should be done from within the Linux instance.


[02-Nov-18 08:49 AM] kevint#5113
so I have to mnt c to find it, it's not part of the linux system files?


[02-Nov-18 08:50 AM] Mike#2447
You should find C under /mnt


[02-Nov-18 08:51 AM] Mike#2447
For me it was already mounted.


[02-Nov-18 08:52 AM] kevint#5113
My arweave install must not have completed or I did it wrong

That looks like the correct install script.  Do you know what part went wrong?  You could always enter each command manually.


[02-Nov-18 08:56 AM] kevint#5113
No, I just cant find the arweave dir


[02-Nov-18 08:58 AM] Mike#2447
Well, if you ran the script and you don't see it under your home directory, then something didn't go right.


[02-Nov-18 08:58 AM] kevint#5113
And linux is not my first language, lol


[02-Nov-18 08:59 AM] Mike#2447
Try running just:  curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/master/install.sh | bash && cd arweave


[02-Nov-18 09:03 AM] kevint#5113
That is doing a lot more on the screen


[02-Nov-18 09:04 AM] Mike#2447
If that completes successfully, then you can run the following two commands to get up to date on the latest release.

git fetch --all
git checkout N.1.5.0.0-RC-5


[02-Nov-18 09:04 AM] Mike#2447
After which you should be ready to start.


[02-Nov-18 09:05 AM] kevint#5113
ok, thanks for the help


[02-Nov-18 09:05 AM] Mike#2447
You're welcome!


[02-Nov-18 09:06 AM] kevint#5113
It probably a pretty fruitless exercise, I doubt I have any chance of actually mining a block with this setup, but I'm curious about the process


[02-Nov-18 09:07 AM] Mike#2447
It can't hurt!  I have an older dual core Pentium that has found 8 blocks in the last 2 weeks or so.


[02-Nov-18 09:09 AM] Mike#2447
The hardest part will be downloading enough blocks to start mining on a regular basis.


[02-Nov-18 09:10 AM] kevint#5113
I see that. I probably need to get a machine and hardwire it to my router.

some type of permission problem


[02-Nov-18 09:31 AM] Mike#2447
Yikes.  I'm not sure on that one.


[02-Nov-18 09:31 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hi @kevint It looks like you do not have permissions to write files into the current directory?


[02-Nov-18 09:32 AM] Mike#2447
It seems weird to me that you'd make it that far into the install, only to have it get stuck there.


[02-Nov-18 09:33 AM] Mike#2447
You shouldn't need root access to write a file to your home directory.


[02-Nov-18 09:33 AM] kevint#5113
I am going to try on a linux system I have, and just see how that goes


[02-Nov-18 09:34 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Sure @kevint


[02-Nov-18 09:34 AM] arweave-sam#9630
But this is most likely a fairly simple issue


[02-Nov-18 09:35 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Did you make the directory that you are trying to run `install.sh` in in the Windows GUI (assuming you are using WSL)?


[02-Nov-18 09:35 AM] arweave-sam#9630
That can sometimes cause permission/ownership issues


[02-Nov-18 09:36 AM] kevint#5113
Where should I run it from? I see that I did it from $ so I should probably be in my user folder


[02-Nov-18 09:37 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Please can you let me know what the response is when you run `pwd`?


[02-Nov-18 09:37 AM] kevint#5113
/


[02-Nov-18 09:39 AM] Mike#2447
Linux is not my first language, but can't Kevin run `cd ~` to get to his home directory and try again?


[02-Nov-18 09:40 AM] kevint#5113
That's what I was thinking, I had been poking around looking for arweave, and Iforgot where I was when I ran the command


[02-Nov-18 09:41 AM] kevint#5113
So went back to /home/kevin


[02-Nov-18 09:41 AM] Mike#2447
I would try again and see what happens.  At least you have the dependencies already installed at this point.


[02-Nov-18 09:43 AM] kevint#5113
I'm running it


[02-Nov-18 09:57 AM] kevint#5113
Ok, that was the key, thanks for helping. It's been a while since I have used Linux for anything buy burning a cd


[02-Nov-18 09:58 AM] kevint#5113
I don't have a wallet, how do I deal with this part of the mining script?


[02-Nov-18 09:58 AM] kevint#5113
mine mining_addr YOUR-MINING-ADDRESS


[02-Nov-18 10:02 AM] kevint#5113
Nevermind, I didn't read well enough, I think I see it


[02-Nov-18 10:04 AM] Mike#2447
Just run it without the mining_addr flag and it will generate a wallet for you.  Going forward, add in the mining_addr flag and your wallet address.


[02-Nov-18 10:04 AM] Mike#2447
Glad to hear it's working  


[02-Nov-18 10:06 AM] kevint#5113
I made one with the web extension, so I use that, correct?


[02-Nov-18 10:10 AM] Mike#2447
You can, just make sure you copy the wallet.json file to a secure location.  You can never be too safe with these sorts of things.


[02-Nov-18 10:21 AM] kevint#5113
Does it just start downloading blocks at some point automatically?


[02-Nov-18 10:22 AM] Mike#2447
You can open another WSL instance, navigate to your arweave folder and run `make log` to see what is happening.


[02-Nov-18 10:24 AM] Mike#2447
Or you can browse to the arweave folder using Windows Explorer and see if the blocks folder is starting to fill up.
C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\LocalState\rootfs\home\USERNAME\arweave\blocks


[02-Nov-18 10:24 AM] kevint#5113
Yes, I looked there, nothing yet


[02-Nov-18 10:24 AM] Mike#2447
Hmmm...

That part looks good to me.


[02-Nov-18 10:25 AM] kevint#5113
Where the terminal is at after I ran the script


[02-Nov-18 10:26 AM] Mike#2447
You will have to launch WSL again from your Windows start menu to run additional terminal commands.


[02-Nov-18 10:26 AM] kevint#5113
ok


[02-Nov-18 10:27 AM] kevint#5113
This need to stay open like this to mine, correct?


[02-Nov-18 10:27 AM] Mike#2447
The first terminal does.  The `make log` terminal can be closed.


[02-Nov-18 10:29 AM] Mike#2447
There's probably a way to launch the arweave server using the `screen` command and have it keep working after closing all open terminals.  I don't have that answer off the top of my head though.


[02-Nov-18 10:29 AM] kevint#5113
Ok


[02-Nov-18 10:40 AM] kevint#5113
It's working on my pure linux machine, but I see a difference after the last line on the Windows, it doesn't say "joining the Arweave network"


[02-Nov-18 10:43 AM] Mike#2447
It should definitely say that.  Then, after it downloads the 100 joining blocks, it should indicate that you have joined the Arweave network.


[02-Nov-18 10:46 AM] kevint#5113
yeah, I got the 100 blocks on the other one, then I see a message in the log -


[02-Nov-18 10:46 AM] kevint#5113
Could not start mining


[02-Nov-18 10:46 AM] kevint#5113
stored_recall_block_for_foreign_verification


[02-Nov-18 10:48 AM] Mike#2447
That is good.  You should continue seeing lots of those messages.  Eventually, you will have the recall block needed to begin mining.  It might take days or longer before that happens though.  Or you could get lucky and have it be much sooner.


[02-Nov-18 10:50 AM] kevint#5113
ah, ok. Unfortunately its a pretty small disk, so I would probably need to recreate using a larger one, but at least I know how the install works, and that I can really mine


[02-Nov-18 11:15 AM] kevint#5113
I restarted my windows machine and the WSL service, but it won't get to joining the arweave network


[02-Nov-18 11:16 AM] kevint#5113
I can't see any errors when the script runs


[02-Nov-18 12:13 PM] Mike#2447
Is it possible you performed some sort of operation on a file or folder in the WSL directory using Windows?  If all else fails, you can reset WSL and try again.

@arweave-sam


[02-Nov-18 02:55 PM] kevint#5113
So if there is an internet interruption, I have to run that startup script again?


[02-Nov-18 02:56 PM] Mike#2447
You should just need the ./arweave-server peer ......   to start back up.


[02-Nov-18 02:58 PM] kevint#5113
Ok, yes That's what I meant, my wireless is not always consistent


[02-Nov-18 02:59 PM] Mike#2447
Occasionally things might get stuck or an error could occur.  Just ctrl+c or open a new terminal and start again.

[03-Nov-18 08:58 AM] tiamat#9131
it's about RAM not disk space, you are probably ok


[03-Nov-18 09:22 AM] kevint#5113
I just don't understand why it started right after a reboot, shouldn't that clear the ram?


[03-Nov-18 09:23 AM] Mike#2447
I believe it's just a notification from Erlang that a new high amount of memory has been used.  It's not necessarily a bad thing.


[03-Nov-18 09:27 AM] kevint#5113
It does join the network successfully, and I'm still downloading blocks, so I guess just informational

Hi @periq - I'd be happy to help you out. We updated the wallet format totally, so there's a new process to claim your tokens, now that mainnet has launched. We can help you through every stage though - please just drop us an email to team@arweave.org and we'll get started.

As for the wallet format - you don't have to use the web extension if you don't want to - you can generate a wallet over at Upvest (https://me.upvest.co/) which can hold your AR tokens, once we've finished the claiming process.

TCP/IP failed to establish an outgoing connection because the selected local endpoint was recently used to connect to the same remote endpoint. This error typically occurs when outgoing connections are opened and closed at a high rate, causing all available local ports to be used and forcing TCP/IP to reuse a local port for an outgoing connection. To minimize the risk of data corruption, the TCP/IP standard requires a minimum time period to elapse between successive connections from a given local endpoint to a given remote endpoint.


[10-Nov-18 08:58 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Wondering if anyone else sees such warnings on WSL when they experience miner network connectivity issues


[11-Nov-18 06:25 AM] Vilenarios#8742
So the above issue is due to ephemeral port exhaustion - only resolvable by reboot it seems.  This happens on my WSL miners after 24 hours or so of mining.  I have not encountered it on full Ubtuntu miners.


[11-Nov-18 10:37 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Thanks @Vilenarios , that is very interesting. We will see if there are some configuration options we can tweak for the WSL version to alleviate the issue.


[11-Nov-18 10:38 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Regarding the segfault, this normally implies an issue with the combination of OS and Erlang version that you are using.


[11-Nov-18 10:39 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Erlang is built to make the programs that run inside it (the Arweave miner, in this case) free from such errors, so unfortunately the issue is likely at the VM level.


[11-Nov-18 10:39 AM] arweave-sam#9630
What platform/OS/Erlang versions are you using?


[11-Nov-18 04:46 PM] Vilenarios#8742
How can I check my erlang version?

[12-Nov-18 04:57 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hmm ok


[12-Nov-18 04:58 AM] arweave-sam#9630
How frequently do you see this error, and does there seem to be a pattern to its occurrence?


[12-Nov-18 05:09 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Usually after a while of consecutive mining - after 24 hours.  If i restart the miner, it doesnt seem to occur.  Its like the ports gradually get used up, and a restart of the web components fix the job.  But once all ports get exhausted, only a hard reboot seems to fix


[12-Nov-18 05:09 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I could try updating Erlang, looks like yours is more up to date


[12-Nov-18 05:31 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yes, it would be good to know if this still occurs on Erlang r21.


[12-Nov-18 05:47 AM] codybartfast#9308
Just to add an extra data point... I get the "No foreign blocks received from network" on WSL too.  It seems it can be reset by restarting the "LxssManager" service.   I don' t get is so often, maybe about once a week.  (Windows 1809, Ubunutu 18.04, 'apt' version of everything else, so erlang 20 too)


[12-Nov-18 06:01 AM] Vilenarios#8742
cody, do you see the same warning (source TCPIP event id 4227) in your System event log on windows? curious if its the same issue


[13-Nov-18 05:01 AM] codybartfast#9308
I upgraded to Erlang 21 yesterday and then this morning saw the issue, so it doesn't look like v21 is a cure.  But that means I can confirm, yes, it's event id: 4227 with the same text "...  the TCP/IP standard requires a minimum time period to elapse between successive connections from a given local endpoint to a given remote endpoint."


[13-Nov-18 06:13 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Thanks, @codybartfast , we will look into this


[13-Nov-18 07:55 AM] Vilenarios#8742
@arweave-sam So have you guys successfully used a different port than 1984?  Not sure if you read my test results above - it doesnt seem to work right.

Hey @Vilenarios yes, thank you, we did see it. We are currently looking for the source of the issue

@Vilenarios Not currently. It must be a webpage, but it will include all images on the webpage.

Got it - im doing some tests with it now, im actually trying to upload some larger data sets to arweave...

but the plugin seemingly crashes on everything thats not a tiny page

[02-Dec-18 03:08 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Also, you can only archive one thing at a time - would be nice if i didnt have to wait for next block mine


[02-Dec-18 03:09 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I tried this as well, but its a pretty large PDF (75MB) - i guess it wont work with pdfs?

[02-Dec-18 03:11 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I wouldnt mind spending some AR to really put a good chunk of data up there instead of the 500MB we have now.. just seems tough to mass upload


[02-Dec-18 03:11 PM] Vilenarios#8742
If there is a better way im all ears  


[02-Dec-18 03:26 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Also it seems that the AR fee for archiving dramatically goes up as storage size increases.  example 282KB is .03 AR


[02-Dec-18 03:26 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I finally got a 16.1MB page to preview in the chrome extension, and it actually tells me "Currently limited to 5MB" so that answers my question...


[02-Dec-18 03:27 PM] Vilenarios#8742
However, the cost is 31.7 AR...  @arweave-martin is there a table or scale or something that i could reference for storage costs for putting something on arweave?


[02-Dec-18 03:30 PM] Vilenarios#8742
as 12MB file is 13ar... so its like exponentially increasing or something


[02-Dec-18 03:30 PM] tierralibre#2740
@Vilenarios  you know what is the unit?


[02-Dec-18 03:31 PM] tierralibre#2740
AR how many decimals from th e wallet


[02-Dec-18 03:31 PM] tierralibre#2740
is 10 12


[02-Dec-18 03:31 PM] arweave-martin#1169
For what I know, PDFs won't work with the Chrome extension currently. The good new is that we're already working on more ways of uploading data and also removing/reducing limitations  


[02-Dec-18 03:32 PM] tierralibre#2740
if you hast in github raw then I think it can be uploaded


[02-Dec-18 03:32 PM] tierralibre#2740
anything


[02-Dec-18 03:33 PM] Vilenarios#8742
12 decimals


[02-Dec-18 03:34 PM] tierralibre#2740
thank you


[02-Dec-18 03:34 PM] arweave-martin#1169
The per MB goes up when storing larger files. This is by design. The solution is to split the upload into smaller chunks. That will be the recommended way of uploading large files and we are already building tools that will do this for you so it's easy and cheap to upload larger files.


[02-Dec-18 03:42 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Makes sense.  Awesome to hear you guys are already working on that.  64K is usually a good chunk size to write BLOBs


[02-Dec-18 03:44 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Well i guess ill wait for that before i do any more tests.  Id rather not blow through all my AR for testing

[29-Dec-18 07:19 PM] 2072 [ANFRA]#9291
I've tried to archive the following page 3 times, the 3rd with `safe mode` disabled: https://blockchainfrance.net/2018/01/24/tutoriel-comment-declarer-ses-gains-en-cryptomonnaies/


[01-Jan-19 10:24 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Hey @2072 [ANFRA], I don't see any reason why this page can't be archived. I've forwarded it to some of our devs to look into further, i'll let you know what they say :blockchain:


[01-Jan-19 10:24 AM] 2072 [ANFRA]#9291
Thanks!

{Reactions}
  

[03-Jan-19 04:11 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
So @2072 [ANFRA], the reason why your transaction failed is because the page that you were trying to archive is larger than the upload limit. Currently the maximum upload limit is 3MB. I just checked and this page in particular has a size of 3.76 MB


[03-Jan-19 11:58 AM] 2072 [ANFRA]#9291
ah ok thanks. It would nice to have more details in the error message

I have a question. I have uploaded a lot of transactions with our tile archiving program. they seem to be processing. I see as well that  they appear as pending on my local node. If some fail. is there a way to manually send it again? Where are they stored? I looked in txs but I don't see them there.


[05-Jan-19 11:02 AM] tiamat#9131
I think you will have to wait for a tx to be confirmed before you upload the next


[05-Jan-19 11:02 AM] tiamat#9131
from the same account


[05-Jan-19 11:04 AM] tiamat#9131
you can get a tx with GET http://<NODEIP>:1984/tx/<TRANSACTION_ID>

I am using the ADT


[05-Jan-19 11:05 AM] tierralibre#2740
I was basing myself on the queue app


[05-Jan-19 11:05 AM] tierralibre#2740
but  I removed the wait for confirmation. (Impatient)


[05-Jan-19 11:06 AM] tierralibre#2740
now I put back the delay and maybe I will add the confirmation part. But I am testing as well other parts of the program


[05-Jan-19 11:06 AM] tierralibre#2740
I checked that is pending


[05-Jan-19 11:06 AM] tierralibre#2740
and I am sure there must be away to check in erlang too. I will look


[05-Jan-19 11:21 AM] tierralibre#2740
I changed back the code to wait for one block with the transactions like it was originally. lets see  


[05-Jan-19 11:21 AM] tierralibre#2740
is going to take some hours though now is a lot of little files


[05-Jan-19 11:41 AM] tiamat#9131
I have seen some multi-file upload tags on github


[05-Jan-19 11:41 AM] tiamat#9131
that should ease these things


[05-Jan-19 01:21 PM] tierralibre#2740
I based mine on the queue app and changed it . So now you pass a folder and it goes through the folder and builds some  transactions and uploads all. Is for loading high resolution tiles for open source soil maps. I have selected a small area for  the proof of concept. It is working it seems. now I wait. Next I am writing a plugin so the tiles can be read directly from the weave. so the way it works now is that once all the files are uploaded  I create another transaction which is an index and contains the Z, X, Z and transaction ids for each tile. So next I will be pulling this from leaflet and loading the tiles with  a plugin.


[05-Jan-19 01:22 PM] tierralibre#2740
I did other tests before by manually creating. But I need an automatic workflow. Now with QGIS I make any tile map from a high resolution raster. Put that on a folder and call the app .


[05-Jan-19 01:23 PM] tierralibre#2740
Once is cleaned I will document and is all open source. (Just not ready yet).


[05-Jan-19 01:23 PM] tierralibre#2740
just launched a  new machine in AWS now doing it. Because I think is going to take some time. The queue waits for 1 block.

it is working a lot better on the aws box though than on my laptop


[07-Jan-19 02:52 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@tierralibre if you do not wait for 2 (or more) confirmations in the `app_queue`, you are likely to lose some txs due to forks.

thank you @arweave-lev


[07-Jan-19 02:55 AM] arweave-lev#3466
Happy to help. Also, if you have files bigger than 3MB (the current tx size limit), it's worth using a new app that splits the given file into chunks and uploads them as separate (but linked) transactions - https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/blob/get-tx-status-endpoint/src/apps/app_bulk_upload.erl

You give it the ID of the last tx, and it reassembles the blob (or even part of it if it's not the very last tx), the result is stored in the given file - https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/blob/get-tx-status-endpoint/src/apps/app_bulk_upload.erl#L52.

Hey @polygravity_bastian, Our nodes don't have this issue. How often does it happen?

Hey @arweave-martin I only have this issue on one of my two nodes too...

@polygravity_bastian I've traced this back to there seems to be some TXs missing on disk for you. I'm a bit surprised you get this error so frequently. Will look into it more tomorrow.


[05-Feb-19 11:44 AM] arweave-martin#1169
Did you clean up / delete files manually? Especially files in the `txs` directory.


[06-Feb-19 07:16 AM] polygravity_bastian#0358
nope


[10-Feb-19 08:53 PM] KeeJef#7523
You guys got a web based gateway that fetches things off the Arweave?


[11-Feb-19 03:27 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Hey @KeeJef, sure, it's arweave.net/txid [input your transaction id]


[11-Feb-19 03:29 AM] KeeJef#7523
Sorry I mean is the code that runs that server open source. Can I set my own one up


[11-Feb-19 03:45 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @KeeJef , currently the gateways are just load balancers with some request mapping


[11-Feb-19 03:48 AM] KeeJef#7523
Cool! but is there code alive so I can launch my own?


[11-Feb-19 03:49 AM] KeeJef#7523
Anything on github for the web server?


[11-Feb-19 03:58 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
At the moment they're off the shelf load balancers so we don't have any specific code to give out. We're working on our own replacement for this though with more features.

You could setup something as simple as a digital ocean load balancer if you want something quick and easy for now https://www.digitalocean.com/products/load-balancer/, or you could setup your own using nginx http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/load_balancing.html which will give you more control


[11-Feb-19 03:58 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
That way you can have my-arweave-nodes.org accept requests and send them to your miners to serve content from


[12-Feb-19 02:06 AM] KeeJef#7523
Sorry i forgot to respond to this, so how does this actually work. when a request is made to the gateway does it have to communicate directly with a miner? how is the load balancing done currently for your gateway, is there some command in the arweave daemon (i assume this is a thing) i can call to get a list of all miners on the network? or do you guys just have a list of hardcoded miners that you fetch data from?


[12-Feb-19 03:58 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
There's nothing specific to arweave going on with load balancers at the moment. When you configure a load balancer you just tell it what to listen for and where to send the request, so ours listen for requests on port 80 and 443 (http and https ports), and then it forwards the requests to a set of arweave nodes.


[12-Feb-19 03:58 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
The load balancer also takes care of checking to see if the nodes are responding slowly/down etc and then routes traffic around them.


[12-Feb-19 03:59 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
As I said though these are features of a standard off the shelf  load balancers, not arweve specific at the moment


[12-Feb-19 12:13 PM] MiX#8888
hey guys! why is this page https://tokens.arweave.org/ not working? i click the button and nothing happens


[12-Feb-19 12:21 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @MiX , we've added a number of anti-spam checks which I think you might be triggering, for example multiple accounts from the same IP address or lots of failed logins will trigger this.


[12-Feb-19 12:22 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
If you email us from the account linked to your google account we can check this for you if you think it's an error


[12-Feb-19 07:01 PM] KeeJef#7523
Right but, what are the set of Arweave nodes you are using? how can i get a list of nodes i can hit so i can create a gateway like this?


[12-Feb-19 11:45 PM] KeeJef#7523
we want to setup a gateway for a project we are working on with @arweave-sam so yeah if we can get some direction on what nodes to hit for the gateway that would be great


[13-Feb-19 02:33 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@KeeJef If you don't want to use you own nodes, then you can crawl the network by asking the nodes for their peers. You will get the peers on the `/peers` HTTP endpoint.


[13-Feb-19 02:34 AM] arweave-martin#1169
We're using our own nodes for our load balancer.


[13-Feb-19 04:49 AM] arweave-martin#1169
As a shortcut, you can get around 100 peers from our nodes behind our load balancer here: http://arweave.net/peers


[13-Feb-19 04:57 AM] KeeJef#7523
Thanks Martin. Will report back if I have issues

{Reactions}
  

[13-Feb-19 09:31 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @KeeJef , you might find simple peer explorer useful, I just published it to the network so you can access it from any node/gateway and it'll tell you about the peers it knows about.

So if you access it on arweave.net you can see the peers our nodes know about
http://arweave.net/bNbA3TEQVL60xlgCcqdz4ZPHFZ711cZ3hmkpGttDt_U

And if you access it from any node it'll tell you about that nodes peers
http://18.191.171.202:1984/bNbA3TEQVL60xlgCcqdz4ZPHFZ711cZ3hmkpGttDt_U

Just click the play button in the top right and it'll start loading.


[13-Feb-19 06:03 PM] KeeJef#7523
Sweet thanks for that. Should be useful


[20-Feb-19 10:58 AM] mrbig#6033
trying to run the miner for the first time on a windows linux subsystem but getting an error "Building dependencies...
./bin/mute-on-success: 1: ./bin/mute-on-success: make: not found" what am I doing wrong? I followed all directions on website to start the miner. I'm sure it's something simple I missed


[20-Feb-19 11:01 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@mrbig It says you don't have `make`. Lookup how to install make in WSL and install it and it should be fine.


[20-Feb-19 11:02 AM] mrbig#6033
thanks martin Il'l give that a go..I'm pretty green with linux


[20-Feb-19 11:02 AM] arweave-martin#1169
I haven't used WSL so I don't know how.


[20-Feb-19 11:03 AM] mrbig#6033
that did it...installed make and it's running now thanks again


[20-Feb-19 11:03 AM] arweave-martin#1169
Or wait a minute. Maybe I misunderstood the output. What happens if you type `make`?


[20-Feb-19 11:03 AM] arweave-martin#1169
aah, cool


[20-Feb-19 04:50 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I just installed a new miner and I had issues running the install.sh script.


[20-Feb-19 04:50 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Best way to setup a new miner, regardless if Ubuntu or WSL is to run each line in the install script manually as sudo


[20-Feb-19 04:51 PM] Vilenarios#8742
That’s had the best results for me.


[21-Feb-19 03:11 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@Vilenarios Thanks for the feedback! I have had a look at the script, so I will and see if I can find improve it.

Just wanted to know where can I find the information to get the tokens, convert to arweave and the rest of the information I will need

thanks


[25-Feb-19 03:30 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Hey @MigueKun, if you could drop us a line to team@arweave.org with the email address you registered in the sale with, I can check we have all the relevant details for you and send over your tokens. You do not have to worry about any conversion of ARC to AR: this was simply a name change. You will need to send me your wallet address, however if you haven't already set up a wallet, you can find out how to do so here: https://docs.arweave.org/info/wallets/arweave-web-extension-wallet

[25-Feb-19 04:06 AM] MigueKun#2242
Ok, thx. Will you need the tx of the eth transaction? Public key or any other detail?


[25-Feb-19 05:14 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
No it's ok, you can start by just emailing us on the email address you registered in the sale with @MigueKun


[25-Feb-19 07:59 PM] KeeJef#7523
You guys got any code for converting the raw TX data into its source document


[25-Feb-19 07:59 PM] KeeJef#7523
for example turning this  http://arweave.net/tx/CCyFRuYwwhWJlzgw4RobDdiwucR0Q1THP2Cy1UOVo54


[25-Feb-19 07:59 PM] KeeJef#7523
into this http://arweave.net/CCyFRuYwwhWJlzgw4RobDdiwucR0Q1THP2Cy1UOVo54


[25-Feb-19 08:00 PM] KeeJef#7523
whats actually happening inbetween the raw and the rendered


[26-Feb-19 03:42 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @KeeJef , the raw transactions you see on /tx/{hash} are just JSON objects, the data is base64 encoded


[26-Feb-19 03:44 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
When you request the transaction hash without the /tx/ part the node just extracts the data field and base64 decodes the response for you. When sending a transaction you can add a  content type tag and this will control the content type http header the node puts on the response, so tagging a  transaction with 'Content-Type: text/html' makes sure it gets server correctly as a html page


[26-Feb-19 03:48 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
The same works for PDFs for example, you can base64 encode the pdf and put it in the data field of a transaction, then add a 'Content-Type: application/pdf' tag and the nodes will serve the PDF to browsers correctly (e.g. http://arweave.net/MQy6AXiqZGmHcrMMlNuH6m_tBMYymoAx1jcXI51_ouM)


[26-Feb-19 03:49 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
you can see the base64 decoded tags for that pdf example here https://viewblock.io/arweave/tx/MQy6AXiqZGmHcrMMlNuH6m_tBMYymoAx1jcXI51_ouM

Hey @Rachel - GoodGhosting 👻! A 410 could just be something as simple as the previous transaction still being pending when you send the next one, the CLI tool can't see pending transactions (at least currently)

@Lasse Clausen Most likely, the Wi-Fi owner has blocked everything except 80-88 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) ports.


[18-Mar-19 01:01 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
In my country, this is a frequent occurrence in hotels, in parallel, they still block mail protocols, and thus they hope to avoid hacking from their IP.

VPN is really a good idea, especially if it has a 443 port ))

[07-Apr-19 06:12 AM] njm#6915
Hi Guys. I'm looking to setup an Arweave wallet on an airgapped PC. For transactions, I want to have the ability to sign Arweave transactions on the airgapped machine, & then broadcast on the online machine. Is this possible?


[07-Apr-19 05:42 PM] njm#6915
Pinging @arweave-india  @arweave-martin


[08-Apr-19 03:21 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hey @njm ! Yes, that is definitely possible


[08-Apr-19 03:22 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You would need to find a way of securely setting up the signing software on the air gapped machine, then also find a way of securely moving signed transactions between the machines.


[08-Apr-19 03:23 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I don't think that the `arweave deploy` tool currently has an option for 'export signed tx, but don't broadcast', but I will check with @arweave-kyle


[08-Apr-19 03:30 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @njm, is it data transactions or wallet to wallet transactions you’re looking to sign on your airgapped machine?


[08-Apr-19 03:48 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@njm your air-gapped machine can peer with an online machine so that transactions added to the air-gapped machine are posted to the online one (off course, you need set up networking so that this is the only machine that can talk to the air-gapped one).  To sign transactions on the air-gapped machine, this API can help - https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/blob/master/http_post_unsigned_tx_docs.md.


[08-Apr-19 07:16 AM] Lasse Clausen#6198
@arweave-martin any ideas about this? has anyone ever got it setup so that tweets are automatically added to the Arweave?

[10-Apr-19 03:49 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@Lasse Clausen I'm suspecting this is what happens if you're creating a transaction before your last one was mined. Does it sound reasonable that this is what happened to you? Currently, you can only have one transaction per wallet per block.


[10-Apr-19 03:53 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yes, the multi-tx per wallet per block patch is waiting for the next hard fork. At the moment the first TX will clobber the second (removing it from the mempool) as the `GET /wallet/____/last_tx` endpoint returns the last _mined_ transaction ID, not the last seen TXID. Currently it is up to the client in question to keep track of the last_tx's if it wants to chain them.


[10-Apr-19 04:18 AM] rehash#3438
is there an aprox date/timeframe for the next hard fork?


[10-Apr-19 04:36 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Currently we are looking at having it ready in the next 6 weeks or so, but we will firm up the dates once we have a 'feature freeze' on exactly what will be making it into this version.


[10-Apr-19 04:37 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The process will be basically the same as the last one: We will let you know the feature list, patch nodes, and release the final build approximately a week before the hard fork will trigger.


[10-Apr-19 04:38 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We will then put notifications in the # tech-announcements channel here, as well as on our twitter and on the mining mailing list.


[10-Apr-19 04:38 AM] tiamat#9131
is 1 week enough? we still have "release 19" nodes


[10-Apr-19 04:39 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The tool that @tiamat built ( https://chronobot.io/arweave/ ) is a great way to track who is on which version


[10-Apr-19 04:39 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Haha, type his name and he shall appear @tiamat  


[10-Apr-19 04:39 AM] arweave-sam#9630
It was long enough last time, but that is a fair point


[10-Apr-19 04:40 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We are still getting into the swing of performing hard forks, so we will have to learn about community reaction times and develop some standard practices as we go.


[10-Apr-19 04:45 AM] tiamat#9131
Also depends if it is emergency (like in the dao hack) or just an upgrade/improvement


[10-Apr-19 05:00 AM] arweave-sam#9630
True, we like to use the mining mailing list sparingly so that if we do have an emergency like that, response from the community will be faster.

Is there another more secure wallet than the chrome extension?


[13-Apr-19 12:50 AM] herve#8091
Something that supports offline transactions?


[13-Apr-19 12:51 AM] rehash#3438
you would have to use the API for that


[13-Apr-19 07:46 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@Lasse Clausen The next forking upgrade will raise that limit, which will alleviate your problem.


[13-Apr-19 07:50 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@herve For now we suggest using the Chrome extension on an airgapped machine


[13-Apr-19 07:51 AM] arweave-sam#9630
But yes, an easy-to-use offline transaction generator would be nice


[13-Apr-19 07:51 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We expect to see more wallet integrations in the future


[13-Apr-19 08:44 AM] rehash#3438
#2 can you see your signed tx in the chrome extension? and then where you submit it when you put it on an online machine? I mean can you do these with the wallet alone?


[13-Apr-19 01:34 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It's a bit hacky, but you can see all of the necessary details of the signed transaction in the transfer details pane.


[13-Apr-19 01:36 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Obviously if your node is offline the transaction dispatch itself will fail, but you can copy the signed transaction components to an online machine and manually dispatch it.


[13-Apr-19 02:58 PM] herve#8091
hi @arweave-sam thank you for your response. I can see the raw transaction details from airgap machine but how to do I take that information and broadcast it on an online machine?


[13-Apr-19 02:59 PM] herve#8091
looking to understand the exact steps when you say  "copy the signed transaction components to an online machine and manually dispatch it."


[15-Apr-19 04:25 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Sure! You would have to rearrange the JSON output from the debug screen so that it represents a 'flat' transaction (move the nested JSON dict properties into the upper context), then `POST /tx` this to the network. The easiest way to do probably with curl, if you are comfortable with using the command line.


[15-Apr-19 04:25 AM] arweave-sam#9630
That said, I will ask the product team if they can add an 'export transaction' button, so that you can do this in a simpler manner.

The difference is that the top one uses a 'text formatter' element between the Twitter and Arweave integrations

Then archives the output of the text formatter, rather than the raw tweet

@arweave-sam  do you know how they use the text formatter ?


[23-Apr-19 09:49 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@Rex You need to know the IP address of a node in the network in order to get connected. If you do not know the IP address of any accessible node in the net, you could use Loki, Tor, or a classic VPN to get connected to the first node.

[29-Apr-19 03:43 AM] Daxter#3955
Hi, sorry for the super basic question, but do I have to spend tokens every time I want to update my permaweb page? Is it even possible to do so(as in keeping the same address, I get that the old page is there forever)? Or is the idea to complete something without deploying it, then deploy the page exactly once at the end?


[29-Apr-19 04:15 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @Daxter uploads are fundamentally immutable, the IDs which go into the URL are derived from the transaction signature, which in turn is derived from the transaction data, previous transaction id, network fee, etc. So if you wanted to update an uploaded page you would simply upload a new version with a new ID and the old page would remain there still.


[29-Apr-19 04:16 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Depending on the use case it might be possible for a client to implement diffs, and then just upload diffs and have the client piece the current version together a bit like git, however if it's a webpage simply uploading a new version with a new ID and url is the way to go as browsers aren't that smart


[29-Apr-19 04:25 AM] Daxter#3955
Thanks  


[29-Apr-19 12:33 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep -- you can then just update your DNS (etc.) records to point to the TXID of the new version, but everyone that has a copy of the old ID will still be able to access the old version  


[09-May-19 06:20 PM] Zeus#2212
What I would suggest Daxter is to have a request to a server where it has some details of your project, including the version. And each page you deploy (update) will have a newer version. If the person visit the old page then they will get a small alert saying to go to the new address (pointing to the new page ID that you set in your server details)


[10-May-19 04:35 AM] arweave-lev#3466
I think there is a way to do it without leaving the borders of the Permaweb - make the app query transactions from the same wallet with the application tag. Another tag could be introduced to be able to give "permissions" to a different wallet.


[10-May-19 09:08 AM] Zeus#2212
cool idea @arweave-lev   using the tag and the addy

Hi all!

As we head towards the holidays we wanted to let you know that the Archain team will soon be on leave for the festive period, meaning that we'll be less active on Discord, and we'll take a little longer than usual to answer messages and emails. We'll be back in the office as usual again from the 4th of January, and look forward to speaking with you all then!

Thank you all for contributing so much to the Archain community and being so active here on Discord – this has been a great platform for us to hear different thoughts and perspectives on both the wider goals of the project and intricate technicalities of the software. 

We hope that you all have a happy holiday season, and a positive and productive new year too! 

All the best

From today onwards, Archain will be known as Arweave. This will further differentiate us from similarly named cryptocurrency projects, while putting the focus on our novel and innovative blockweave technology. Rest assured that we remain totally committed to our mission of building a universal platform for information permanence, and there is no change or impact on the tokens held by our backers. Same team, same vision, same technology – just a new name.

You can read more about the name change on our Medium blog post here: https://medium.com/@arweave/archain-now-known-as-arweave-432f0708eed0 , and check out our brand new website at www.arweave.org. 

If you have any questions, comments, or feedback feel free to share them here on Discord, or email us directly at our new team email address (team@arweave.org).

Thanks as always for your time and support everyone!

Hello all!

We have just sent out an important email to all presale backers from the 2017 token sale (back when we were called Archain). Please keep an eye on your email inbox and your junk/spam folders for this message. 

Let me know if you have any questions or support needs by emailing me at india@arweave.org.


[10-Jun-18 10:57 AM] arweave-india#5075
As many of you already know, as of the 8th of June, the Arweave mainnet is up and running!


[26-Jun-18 09:16 AM] arweave-india#5075
   Arweave tokens are now transferable, meaning they can be sent to and from wallets on the Arweave network.    

The Arweave web extension has also now been published, and offers the dual functionality of a basic native Arweave wallet, and the ability to use your AR tokens to archive webpages. This signifies the completion of our very first use case on the Arweave mainnet - permanently archiving web pages! 

Here is the link to download the Arweave extension from the Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/arweave-client/iplppiggblloelhoglpmkmbinggcaaoc?hl=en-US. Once you have installed the extension, right-click on the icon and select ‘Options’ to get started.

Please note that for  the Upvest wallet, users may need to clear their cache and cookies in order to see the ‘send’ button.  You can continue to use the Upvest wallet if you choose.

The Arweave wallet can also be used as a cold wallet. If you would like these instructions please email the team at team@arweave.org requesting these instructions.

[26-Jun-18 09:18 AM] arweave-india#5075
Instructions for creating your Arweave wallet:

1. Install the Arweave web extension from the Google Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/arweave-client/iplppiggblloelhoglpmkmbinggcaaoc?hl=en-US 

2. Right-click the extension icon (the Arweave logo) on your browser and go to ‘Options’, this brings up the Arweave wallet interface

3. Go to ‘Wallet Options’ in the bottom left and select ‘Generate Wallet’

4. Download the key file, storing it somewhere you will remember, and naming it something memorable

5. Go to ‘Wallet Options’ again, click ‘Load Wallet’

6. Drag and drop the key file into the box provided

7. Set a password for your wallet (optional but recommended) - please type this very carefully. You are responsible for remembering your password and recording it accurately, Arweave cannot recover your wallet if you lose your password.

[27-Jun-18 01:22 PM] arweave-india#5075
Remember:

- Arweave tokens are not ERC-20 tokens, so cannot be used with Ethereum network wallets. AR tokens are native tokens to the Arweave network.

- If you send tokens to an address that does not exist on the Arweave network, you will not be able to recover your tokens. So, do not ever send your AR tokens to an Ethereum wallet address.

- We strongly recommend performing a test transaction with a small quantity of AR tokens, especially when sending to a new address or when using the Arweave or Upvest wallets for the first time.

[05-Sep-18 04:24 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hi all,

Here is a mini-update of what we have been up to:

- Arweave version 1.5 is nearing release. This version builds considerably on the initial main network release, changing approximately 20% of the codebase and delivering faster data access and a more reliable mining experience. This has been the focus on our dev team’s work for a while now, so we’re really excited to get this shipped soon. 

- The second version of the Arweave web extension, with significantly improved user experience (thanks to your community feedback!) is also nearer release. Among the user interface changes, this update will also add features like multiple wallet support.

- Progress continues on the ArchiveIt! permanent file backup system, improving its user interface and general ease of use.

- Exciting work continues bringing new businesses and customers to the network — we will release names at an appropriate moment  .

- We have hired 3 new members of staff, and are in the process of filling three further positions.

- Less exciting, but still necessary operations update: we now have a new office that will be able to accommodate our growing team!

Regarding exchanges: I am sure that you all understand the situation by now - we are in high level talks with a number of exchanges, and we are continuing to make progress, though we cannot discuss any further details publicly at this stage. We would love to tell you all about our progress, but doing so would put that progress itself in jeopardy. We thank you sincerely for your understanding.

Today we're happy to announce the release of 1.6.1.0 of the Arweave Node. This includes a lot of changes since the last release 1.6.1.0 in late November. Here is the digest:

* Rewrite/remake of the custom port feature. When all nodes have upgraded, you will be able to run the miner on other ports than 1984.
* Less verbose output when starting `arweave-server`.
* Added transaction status endpoint (/tx/[transaction_id]/status). See http_iface_docs.md
* Added endpoint for listing all transactions for an wallet (/wallet/[wallet_address]/txs/[earliest_tx]). See http_iface_docs.md
* Let the node create wallets and sign transactions for you. See http_post_unsigned_tx_docs.md
* Mixed improvements to make the node run more reliably.
* Faster block propagation.

Upgrade instructions:
1. Shut down arweave-server.
2. `git fetch --all --tags && git checkout master && git reset --hard N.1.6.1.0`
3. Start arweave-server again with the same arguments as before.

If you're looking for peers to start arweave-server with, you are welcome to use the recently updated peer list found in the mining guide. These peers are all operated by the Arweave organization. https://docs.arweave.org/info/mining/mining-guide

@here Today we are happy to announce the release 1.6.2.0 of the Arweave Node!

We have
- Significantly increased the efficiency of block and transaction propagation.
- Sped up the fork recovery process.
- Added a `GET /wallet/[Addr]/deposits` endpoint for fetching incoming transfers for a wallet. For more details, see https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/blob/N.1.6.2.0/http_iface_docs.md.
- Fixed a bug in the `POST /unsigned_tx` endpoint where it required irrelevant data. The updated endpoint documentation is at https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/blob/N.1.6.2.0/http_post_unsigned_tx_docs.md.
- Made various reliability improvements.

Upgrade instructions:

1. Shut down `arweave-server`.
2. `git fetch --all --tags && git checkout master && git reset --hard N.1.6.2.0`
3. Start `arweave-server` again with the same arguments as before.

For more details on how to run the node, please see our mining guide -
https://docs.arweave.org/info/mining/mining-guide.

Pay attention to the recommended list of peers. It has not been updated since the last release. These peers are all operated by the Arweave organization.

And a little bonus for those willing to contribute - we have prepared a simple guide for external contributors - https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md, check it out!

[04-Apr-19 05:23 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@here Today we are happy to announce the release 1.6.3 of the Arweave Node!

In it:

1. The `block/hash/[hash]` and `block/height/[height]` HTTP endpoints do not return a hash list by default anymore. Viewing blocks in a browser/other HTTP client is now much faster!
2. Reliability improvements of the time measurement for difficulty adjustments.
3. Various reliability improvements for the mining worker processes.
4. New mining benchmark tool, using real candidate block production to measure mining performance much more accurately. You can run it with `./arweave-server benchmark`.Note: As the new benchmarking tool tests real block production speed, not just pure hashing power, it may appear that the effective hashing rate has decreased. This is false. As it happens, the changes mentioned in point 3 lead to improved mining performance.

Upgrade instructions:

1. Shut down arweave-server. To make sure the shutdown was successful, run `ps aux | grep beam`. The output should only have a single line with `grep beam` at the end.
2. git fetch --all --tags && git checkout master && git reset --hard N.1.6.3.1
3. Start arweave-server again with the same arguments as before.

For more details on how to run the node, please see our mining guide -                                                 
https://docs.arweave.org/info/mining/mining-guide.

Pay attention to the recommended list of peers. It has not been updated since the last release. These peers are all operated by the Arweave organization, so use them if you trust them - alternatively join on the IP address of another trusted node.


[04-Apr-19 09:28 AM] arweave-lev#3466
If any of you has already updated to N.1.6.3.0, consider updating to N.1.6.3.1. It contains a fix for the bug when startup would fail if one of the trusted peers is unavailable (thanks @Vilenarios for reporting the issue!). I've also updated the release announcement above to mention N.16.3.1. Under "/info" you should see `"release:" 23`.

@Gyunikuchan  there is already a docker file in github. So I think you can already build your own docker image.

Hi arweave team  what would be a profitable set up for arweave , invest on S9 antminers kind of rigs , or Most important highspeed Harddisks tb#?, bandwidth speed?  etc , can please share what would be a Average Joe investment profitable setup , in other words if I want to buy new equipment where should my investment go recommended from you for best performance ?


[10-Jun-18 12:29 AM] Dom | ID-267610913773715456#6192
You can mine on the mainnet already can’t you?


[10-Jun-18 12:30 AM] Dom | ID-267610913773715456#6192
Sorry just double checking - because I’m not sure where the tokens you mine go? If your wallet isn’t setup yet?


[10-Jun-18 12:42 AM] ATLAS#7218
You have to email the team to be able to mine. Because there is not much miners for now.


[10-Jun-18 12:42 AM] ATLAS#7218
New wallet will be generated if you don't have any wallet connected.


[10-Jun-18 12:50 AM] Mazzz#1871
@ATLAS Are you mining right now?


[10-Jun-18 01:07 AM] ATLAS#7218
Not right now. I will set it up a few days later. Reward is low for starters anyway.


[10-Jun-18 02:50 AM] Scalpzor#0067
Is this like ETH mining or BTC mining?


[10-Jun-18 02:52 AM] Scalpzor#0067
Cryptonight or ?


[10-Jun-18 02:54 AM] ATLAS#7218

[10-Jun-18 04:23 AM] Bicepsueel#6532
What will you be using to mine? I got myself a 1070 ti or is it pcu?


[10-Jun-18 04:31 AM] Marcin#0065
Hey. As far o know asic miner like s9 are for sha256 algorythm, but arweave is sha 384, so pls check out if your specific asic supports it. If im wrong, please clear me up :)


[10-Jun-18 01:29 PM] kui#1562

[10-Jun-18 03:18 PM] Marcin#0065
Yes

How long were the response times until india responded to your mail?


[10-Jun-18 04:38 PM] xlags#7723
They are likely taking a couple of days off, they pulled at least 1 all-nighter end of last week, need to recharge batteries. India is pretty good about getting back to people.


[11-Jun-18 07:37 AM] arweave-india#5075
@xlags Thank you for your understanding! Sadly no days off for us yet  


[11-Jun-18 07:39 AM] arweave-india#5075
@Desy - This depends, I'm happy to answer a PM - sometimes that can be a bit quicker for simple requests. There is a very large number of support requests right now so it's taking us some time to work through emails, etc., but I can reassure you that we'll get back to you ASAP and you won't be overlooked


[11-Jun-18 08:17 AM] Cabbie66#4738
Hi India , i sent you an email re mining , is there a process to go through to get informed about it?


[11-Jun-18 03:27 PM] Alexander#4743
I got my email, and I didn't understand the part regarding the mining fees. If I start mining the next week, I won't get fees during the next 3 months?


[11-Jun-18 03:28 PM] Bicepsueel#6532
Oh, I guess I haven't been properly added to the mining mail list then?


[11-Jun-18 03:29 PM] tierralibre#2740
I did not receive anything either


[11-Jun-18 03:29 PM] Alexander#4743
emails are being sent gradually


[11-Jun-18 03:38 PM] Bicepsueel#6532
@Alexander do they explain in the mail with a step by step guide how to mine and such? Hardware needed?


[11-Jun-18 03:49 PM] Mike#2447
@Alexander  My understanding is that the dev team is mining the network for the next week and all rewards gained are going into a public wallet for future use.  If you look on the front page of arweave.org, it indicates that there are 52 nodes at the moment.  I don't think a node has to mine, but I don't see why it wouldn't.  Where did you get the part about 3 months of no fees?


[11-Jun-18 03:52 PM] Mike#2447
@Bicepsueel The instructions are already available on the arweave github, with the exception of the peer IP(s) needed to connect to the network.  I haven't seen specific hardware requirements, other than a fast CPU, a fast/reliable internet connection and lots of disk space.


[11-Jun-18 04:00 PM] Bicepsueel#6532
@Mike alright it sounds to me you know what you're talking about. I have never been involved with mining before, but this will be my first project and I'm excited to help and try it out. I have yet to learn pretty much everything there is. So could you perhaps explain some stuff or help me out? For example, I'll be buying a new pc soon with an i5 8600K processor, would that be good to mine with? Also, I could get an extra 4TB disk of space, would the be ok to use for the mining?


[11-Jun-18 05:02 PM] Alexander#4743
@Mike it's in the email: "We will be releasing the IP addresses to join the network next week, making sure that everyone can begin receiving transaction rewards at the same time. Until this time, all transaction rewards in the network will be contributed to the rewards pool, to be dispersed to miners at a later date. As mentioned above, the inflation schedule itself will commence in three months’ time, as triggered by block height."


[11-Jun-18 06:24 PM] Spraffers#8357
I haven`t received my email either


[11-Jun-18 07:21 PM] Mike#2447
@Alexander Whoops!  I guess I read through the email too fast and didn't absorb that part.  I'm not exactly sure what is meant by "soft onboarding" or "inflation schedule".  Typically the only thing that inflates with mining is the difficulty level.  Hopefully the dev team can clarify.


[11-Jun-18 07:30 PM] Mike#2447
@Bicepsueel It's hard to say without having another similar crypto to compare it to.  As far as I know, there isn't anything else quite like Arweave.  The 8600K is a pretty decent processor, but I can't say how it will compare in SHA384 hashing versus other CPUs.  I've also been wondering what realistic storage requirements will be.  During the testing phase, folks were just archiving webpages, but it sounds like on mainnet, people are looking to store massive amounts of data.  At this point I would guess that 4 TB is probably a safe start.  Again, hopefully the dev team can chime in with more specific information.  As for getting started, are you able to install Linux on your mining computer?  That's the first step.


[11-Jun-18 08:26 PM] TolerableTrader#4148
fast cpu or fast GPU?  I"ve got a burstcoin miner I can convert to this, roughly 320tb


[11-Jun-18 10:01 PM] Mazzz#1871
How much lower will the mining reward be the first 3 months?


[12-Jun-18 01:40 AM] Massimiliano#2834
Do we need to install Linux on a AWS instance or can run the mining locally on our own laptop? First time for me trying to set up mining, know very little about it. Is it a static IP required? Does the computer/mining station be ALWSYS ON?


[12-Jun-18 01:41 AM] NewbieFT#9201
You can run it on computer as long as you are running linux and yes it needs to be always on


[12-Jun-18 01:44 AM] Massimiliano#2834
Alternatively can be run on a Linux VPS? Wondering if the cost of running the VPS would be offset by the mining rewards


[12-Jun-18 01:51 AM] NewbieFT#9201
you would have to make that call


[12-Jun-18 01:51 AM] NewbieFT#9201
but it probably can run on VPS, whether thats cost effective depends on price paid for it and rewards given


[12-Jun-18 01:59 AM] Massimiliano#2834
Thanks Sunny. I suppose a standard profile laptop with less than 1TB of free hard disk space won’t be sufficient for effective mining?


[12-Jun-18 02:00 AM] NewbieFT#9201
we will find out on storage requirements


[12-Jun-18 02:00 AM] NewbieFT#9201
but it might be ok


[12-Jun-18 02:01 AM] Massimiliano#2834
If the laptop is not always on will the node be disconnected or simply not getting mining rewards during the off time?


[12-Jun-18 02:08 AM] NewbieFT#9201
you wont get any during off time


[12-Jun-18 02:08 AM] NewbieFT#9201
and potentially have to resync all the time when you turn it back on


[12-Jun-18 02:20 AM] Bicepsueel#6532
@Mikecant use a normal pc with windows?


[12-Jun-18 02:21 AM] Bicepsueel#6532
I had the idea to use my own personal pc for the mining.. you guys got dedicated machinery just for the arweave project?


[12-Jun-18 02:29 AM] Massimiliano#2834
Not Windows yet. Been told is on the roadmap but will take few more months


[12-Jun-18 02:38 AM] mickey#7342
is CPU with more cores will mine faster? just wonder server chip vs desktop chip makes any diff or not. As far for ETH mining is GPU orientated which a basic 2 cores CPU is sufficient


[12-Jun-18 02:53 AM] stmkru#5112
Hi! Is here anywhere an instruction on how to mine?


[12-Jun-18 04:17 AM] Scalefinity#7851
SHA384 is much faster on GPU than CPU. I'm analyzing the SHA384 interface code hashcat(https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) at the moment.
I will build a GPU miner as for arweave.
But maybe someone else is faster than I. I hope this person will release the code. atleast the binary.
Any C, C++ or assember programmer there?


[12-Jun-18 04:18 AM] Scalefinity#7851
OpenCL knowledge and Cuda knowledge would be also good.
I'm just a Java EE and Rust developer. I have just some basic idea of C.


[12-Jun-18 04:18 AM] Scalefinity#7851
And I have no clue of Erlang...


[12-Jun-18 04:19 AM] Scalefinity#7851
Maybe someone can help me.
We don't need write much code. Just assemble some parts together...


[12-Jun-18 04:21 AM] Scalefinity#7851
If somebody need SHA-384 benchmarks. Please use hashcat for that:
https://hashcat.net/hashcat/


[12-Jun-18 04:22 AM] Scalefinity#7851
for example:
https://gist.github.com/epixoip/a83d38f412b4737e99bbef804a270c40
Speed.Dev.#1.:  1044.8 MH/s (95.87ms)
for 1XGTX 1080


[12-Jun-18 04:25 AM] Embiei|MassStake#8665
About the storage, i guess is not the same to build 10 TB of a 5400 rpm HDD from a 10TB SSD (evo 960 for example)


[12-Jun-18 04:26 AM] Scalefinity#7851
Just for exmaple:
hashcat --optimized-kernel-enable  --force -a3 -m 10800 -b -D 1
I get about:
Speed.Dev.#1.....: 11290.5 kH/s (91.09ms) @ Accel:512 Loops:256 Thr:1 Vec:2
On my:
Device #1: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3615QM CPU @ 2.30GHz, 4096/16384 MB allocatable, 8MCU (will boost to 3.1Ghz)


[12-Jun-18 04:27 AM] Scalefinity#7851
So, Quad Core CPU from 2012 3ghz boost :11290.5 kH/s
GPU, Nvigia 1080:  1044.8 MH/s


[12-Jun-18 04:27 AM] Scalefinity#7851
Would be stupid to mine it with CPU...


[12-Jun-18 04:27 AM] Scalefinity#7851
Someone have to build an open source miner ASAP.


[12-Jun-18 04:28 AM] Scalefinity#7851
Otherwise, someone will build an GPU mining software and don't publish it. So he/she can use it to mine. Easy 51% attack..


[12-Jun-18 04:40 AM] mickey#7342
just wonder which 1 get more rewards, is storage size/speed vs cpu/gpu hashrate ???


[12-Jun-18 04:54 AM] Scalefinity#7851
All together.
GPU Hashrate + Storate


[12-Jun-18 04:55 AM] Scalefinity#7851
Short term, GPU.
Long term, Storage,  or Storage + GPU


[12-Jun-18 05:01 AM] dswarno#4950
Is there a "protection" against these Bitmain chinese H/W? If not, there is no point for mining ...


[12-Jun-18 05:02 AM] dswarno#4950

that would be great, but right now is hard to imagine


[12-Jun-18 05:07 AM] Embiei|MassStake#8665
i am not a coder, so i dont know shit about the SHA algorithm


[12-Jun-18 05:08 AM] dswarno#4950
Just thinking whether I can get 1 AR token per week with 1060?


[12-Jun-18 05:08 AM] dswarno#4950
wishful thinking?


[12-Jun-18 05:12 AM] Embiei|MassStake#8665
dont know yet


[12-Jun-18 05:12 AM] Embiei|MassStake#8665
its too early to know about that


[12-Jun-18 05:12 AM] Embiei|MassStake#8665
too many factors are unknown yet


[12-Jun-18 05:28 AM] Scalefinity#7851
If you want benchmark your CPU/GPU. Please use hashcat, see my comments.
is is no "protection".
SHA alg were very easy to mine wich ASIC. Bitmain can redesign there antminer very easy to SHA384.
But don't be worry. Arweave is a very small project. They don't care about us. So no ASIC in the near future. Not because of SHA384, because of arweave is not lucrative.


[12-Jun-18 05:33 AM] sergeynov#9096
So can anybody tell me what should I do to start mining arweave on my gpus right now?


[12-Jun-18 05:36 AM] ATLAS#7218
@dswarno  AMDs are better in my experience. RX480 RX580 etc


[12-Jun-18 05:36 AM] ATLAS#7218
but they are kinda rare because of mining


[12-Jun-18 05:37 AM] ATLAS#7218
I think you can get 1AR in 1 week. The reward amount should not be that low


[12-Jun-18 06:45 AM] tierralibre#2740
if you get 4 AR in a month is really not worth to mine. just the electricity will be way more than that.


[12-Jun-18 06:45 AM] dswarno#4950
What is the maximum number of AR token can be mined by the community on daily basis? (Shared by everyone)


[12-Jun-18 06:57 AM] mickey#7342
previous thought a decent CPU + multiple SATA hard drives  will be economy to mine, now with adding GPU, the mining rigs will be more expensive, not sure on the ROI


[12-Jun-18 07:01 AM] Bicepsueel#6532
Maybe we should all just wait for the official mining guide and what we can expect, hardware needed and such?


[12-Jun-18 07:01 AM] Bicepsueel#6532
They'd release that next week right?


[12-Jun-18 08:45 AM] Scalefinity#7851
@sergeynov 
I'm working on that.
At the moment. You can't mine with GPU.


[12-Jun-18 08:46 AM] ATLAS#7218
CPU?


[12-Jun-18 08:47 AM] Scalefinity#7851
You can't mine now.
In few days, we will get some peer IPs. So we can start mining with CPU+HDD Space.
I'm working on a GPU miner. It will take some time...


[12-Jun-18 09:04 AM] Mike#2447
@Alexander I found the inflation information in the white paper:   "As an additional counter to inflation, the amount  of  currency  issued  for  each  successive mining block decreases such that 10% of the tokens in the genesis block are issued in the first year, halving every year thereafter."
I'm guessing that for the first three months or so, the block rewards will not decrease as previously indicated, but we need confirmation from the dev team.


[12-Jun-18 01:05 PM] Marcin#0065
are multi core cpu supported?


[12-Jun-18 01:32 PM] Dentechr#5213
Hello could anybody help me. I am wondering what i could have done wrong while trying to mine for the first time.
When i run ./arweave-server mine 
I get this result:

Please couls anybody give some advice
Thanks a lot


[12-Jun-18 02:04 PM] Mike#2447
type:   "make clean"  then  "make all"  and try again.  You won't connect without the peer IP, but it shouldn't crash anymore.


[12-Jun-18 02:07 PM] Dentechr#5213
Great! Thanks mike
Make all did the job


[12-Jun-18 02:08 PM] Mike#2447
You're welcome!


[12-Jun-18 02:09 PM] Dentechr#5213
If everything works i should get
Progress report right?


[12-Jun-18 02:40 PM] Marcin#0065
I dont think ur able to mine. Test server arent online any more and network peer will be given the next days.


[12-Jun-18 02:41 PM] Marcin#0065
But apart from that, i think u did all correctly


[12-Jun-18 02:45 PM] Dentechr#5213
Great! Thanks a lot for the help.


[12-Jun-18 03:30 PM] Turbo#8519
Hey how's it going? Definitely new to this project.


[12-Jun-18 03:32 PM] Turbo#8519
How does mining work for this project? At first I was told possibly ASIC and then HDD plotting but I see people talking GPU. Can someone point me in the right direction of testing on the test net with GPU?


[12-Jun-18 05:56 PM] JP#7032
@arweave-india  , @AndreYuryevich  cloudmining  service connected to local hardrives setup ? , expected profit table , hardware requirements , guide basic, intermediate , advanced hardware including setup guide ?  , this will help to attract more miners , please consider


[12-Jun-18 09:48 PM] thegoat19#8424
Is it hdd mining?

GTFO scammer


[14-Jun-18 08:42 AM] arweave-india#5075
@Batou 

We absolutely do not endorse reselling of tokens - there is absolutely no way to guarantee legitimacy and the amount of scammers around is very high. Just exercise extreme caution in every case guys - from what we have seen on Telegram and in other avenues, you are much, much more likely to get scammed in these instances than actually manage to purchase any tokens


[14-Jun-18 08:42 AM] arweave-india#5075
Regarding the mining questions all - I have passed this on to the team and hopefully someone can pop in and update you guys very soon


[18-Jun-18 11:02 AM] Jinbin Xie Huobi Ventures#2044
where is the mine IP？


[18-Jun-18 11:03 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hi there - this will be released via email to all on the mining mailing list this week  


[18-Jun-18 11:03 AM] Jinbin Xie Huobi Ventures#2044
OK，thank you


[18-Jun-18 11:26 AM] walter whitelist#8353
@arweave-india how can I join that list? Unable to find it on the website


[18-Jun-18 11:27 AM] arweave-india#5075
No problem - at the moment the way to join is by emailing me directly from your preferred email address at india@arweave.org


[18-Jun-18 11:27 AM] arweave-india#5075
And I'll reply to your email with the 'getting started' mining guide


[18-Jun-18 11:27 AM] walter whitelist#8353
Thanks!  


[19-Jun-18 03:30 AM] iBatman#2943
Hi has anyone received the mining instruction email?


[19-Jun-18 03:38 AM] nick cloudpost#7139
Hello guys! Glad that you have a dedicated mining chat. Emailed India and waiting for instructions to get started


[19-Jun-18 05:52 AM] yemboy#6783
When are we getting the IP?


[19-Jun-18 05:58 AM] Marcin#0065
Probably this week.


[19-Jun-18 05:58 AM] Marcin#0065
But no mining rewards in the first 3 months, so everyone can set up. Maybe not complete 0 rewards, but very low in the beginning


[19-Jun-18 06:03 AM] yemboy#6783
Okay but what is the reward per block? Having it as no reward will not make miners put in their best as they have resources deployed..so a half rate will most likely be better..e.g if reward was to be 10, this first 3 months can be 5. Thats  enough incentive


[19-Jun-18 06:31 AM] Mazzz#1871
@Marcin how low is very low?


[19-Jun-18 07:20 AM] Mike#2447
Based on the team's original information, block reward is 105 AR with 5 minute block times, plus size dependent transaction fees.  This information no longer seems to be listed anywhere, so I don't know if it has changed.


[19-Jun-18 07:23 AM] Mike#2447
5 minute block times equals 288 blocks per day.  At the current block height of 7285, this would mean the network has been up for over 25 days, which is not the case.  Either the block specifications have changed, or the difficulty level is not adjusting properly.


[19-Jun-18 07:24 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hey Mike - there's more info about the soft onboarding phase in the 'getting started' guide that explains the rewards for the first few months


[19-Jun-18 07:24 AM] arweave-india#5075
Have I sent you the guide yet?


[19-Jun-18 07:27 AM] Mike#2447
I did get the guide.  That part was a bit unclear as to what "soft onboarding" means, but I took it that the planned 10% per year block reduction would not start until after the first 3 months.  Is that correct?


[19-Jun-18 07:29 AM] Mike#2447
Sorry, that is not correct.


[19-Jun-18 07:30 AM] Mike#2447
"As an additional counter to inflation, the amount  of  currency  issued  for  each  successive mining block decreases such that 10% of the tokens in the genesis block are issued in the first year, halving every year thereafter."


[19-Jun-18 09:56 AM] Obi#1561
@arweave-india I sent you an email around a week ago requesting info about mining, could you please answer me?


[19-Jun-18 09:57 AM] arweave-india#5075
Sure - apologies if I overlooked this - please can you DM me your email address so I can double check my inbox? Thanks


[19-Jun-18 09:58 AM] Obi#1561
@arweave-india could you please dm me first, I don't know how to do it on  mobile


[19-Jun-18 10:22 AM] arweave-india#5075
Sorry Obi we have a general policy of not PMing people first because scammers sadly take advantage of that with impersonators around.

Sorry to ask this but can you just quickly drop me another email from the same address to india@Arweave.org and I'll just use that address to search? Thank you very much


[19-Jun-18 10:23 AM] Obi#1561
Alright I will send another mail. On another note, how to dm someone on discord mobile?


[19-Jun-18 10:23 AM] arweave-india#5075
This sounds silly but I literally never use it on mobile, so I'm not the best to ask! Apologies!


[19-Jun-18 10:34 AM] Mike#2447
Long press a person's name/avatar, then press their name/avatar again and then press the chat button in the lower right corner.  That is for the Android app.


[19-Jun-18 01:41 PM] yemboy#6783
Will external hard disk be suitable to use in addition to the laptop/desktop inbuilt HDD?


[19-Jun-18 07:04 PM] TolerableTrader#4148
I sent another email as well for the guide. Thanks


[19-Jun-18 10:22 PM] Vilenarios#8742
What are the requirements from a network perspective?


[19-Jun-18 10:22 PM] Vilenarios#8742
And what disk sizes are people running with?


[20-Jun-18 08:04 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Gonna try to do a proof of concept in azure before I commit to buying hardware.


[20-Jun-18 08:11 AM] Vilenarios#8742
The mining guide said Linux only but the GitHub mentions windows... are both supported right now?


[20-Jun-18 08:23 AM] arweave-india#5075
@Vilenarios At the moment just Linux is supported, but we will indeed be supporting Windows  in the coming months


[20-Jun-18 08:48 AM] yemboy#6783
@arweave-india  since HDD is very important in arweave Mining...is it possible to use external HDD...will that work or it's just internal HDD?


[20-Jun-18 08:50 AM] nick cloudpost#7139
is there any reward for miners right now? for me the situation is unclear


[20-Jun-18 12:58 PM] Scalefinity#7851
no


[20-Jun-18 04:25 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Okay I’m a Linux noob and I’m getting stuck on actually cloning/installing arweave


[20-Jun-18 04:25 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I tried doing the curl steps on the git repo but it doesn’t appear to work. Plus I have not received the IP address. Anyone??


[20-Jun-18 04:47 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Ok I got it installed. Just need the IP. @arweave-india is this something you could point me to?


[20-Jun-18 05:29 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I scrolled up and saw the IP is not available yet... I’ll keep my eyes peeled. So far so good.


[20-Jun-18 10:08 PM] TaoHuang#2777
is there a instruction for mining?


[21-Jun-18 07:23 AM] Vilenarios#8742
In the GitHub  you can find instructions


[21-Jun-18 07:24 AM] Vilenarios#8742
They are very light. A lot of info missing. Plus no network IP to connect to yet.


[21-Jun-18 07:25 AM] arweave-india#5075
@TaoHuang Vilenarios is correct there are very brief instructions on GitHub, but I'll reply to your email now with a copy of the 'getting started' introductory mining email too as that provides a bit more information


[21-Jun-18 07:26 AM] arweave-india#5075
There is also a blog post from the testnet period with more information here - https://medium.com/@arweave/batn-2-archiving-the-internet-3b0311ea8311

But please note that the IPs are not exclusively accessible by Arweave backers now, they will be publicly available to all in the near future

thanks


[21-Jun-18 07:27 AM] arweave-india#5075
and of course issuing brand new blog post(s) with more information on the latest processes


[21-Jun-18 07:28 AM] arweave-india#5075
@TaoHuang Thanks for your patience, I'm working through my email inbox from overnight!


[21-Jun-18 10:58 PM] mickey#7342
@arweave-india any idea if external hard drive will work for mining or must be internal hard drive? any suggestion as trying to decide which route to go for and planning to buy those hardwares soon


[22-Jun-18 05:19 AM] cromulon#5411
Do you know how far along the windows miner is?


[22-Jun-18 05:50 AM] yemboy#6783
@mickeyasked same question too but no response yey


[22-Jun-18 05:58 AM] arweave-india#5075
I don't think this would be a problem guys but I would recommend waiting for a member of the dev team to pop in and clarify before making any choices - they're just wrapped up at the moment but I've already asked them to drop by


[22-Jun-18 08:55 AM] tibrah#7938
i dont have this mining guide despite requesting for acesss via email to @arweave-india


[22-Jun-18 09:05 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hi there @tibrah please could you drop me a PM so I can look into this for you? Many thanks


[22-Jun-18 01:46 PM] kisa#2346
Question

When arweave comes out can I use upvest to distribute my coins? How would I get my coins on the network


[22-Jun-18 02:47 PM] arweave-india#5075
@kisa Yes you'll soon be able to send out tokens from your Upvest wallet. The mainnet is already up and running. Let me know if you need more information though?


[24-Jun-18 05:38 PM] bitcoinBeliever&30k_by_2020#6947
Can we mine by CPU?


[24-Jun-18 05:38 PM] bitcoinBeliever&30k_by_2020#6947
Or gpu


[24-Jun-18 05:38 PM] Vilenarios#8742
CPU I believe. A gpu miner would be nice though considering all my other gpu mining coins are shit at the moment


[24-Jun-18 05:39 PM] bitcoinBeliever&30k_by_2020#6947
So right now only cpu?


[24-Jun-18 05:40 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I think so - but mining is still in testing mode... I’ll let the team comment on when it will be live


[24-Jun-18 05:40 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I’m still waiting for the pool IP address.


[24-Jun-18 05:40 PM] bitcoinBeliever&30k_by_2020#6947
This is a good coin imo


[24-Jun-18 05:40 PM] bitcoinBeliever&30k_by_2020#6947
Similar to sia coin


[24-Jun-18 05:40 PM] bitcoinBeliever&30k_by_2020#6947
Which did 100x


[24-Jun-18 05:42 PM] bitcoinBeliever&30k_by_2020#6947
What you think?


[24-Jun-18 05:43 PM] bitcoinBeliever&30k_by_2020#6947
But I really want to see how is their product


[24-Jun-18 06:17 PM] txpm621#5261
Looking to Mine. Can someone recommend a rig. Would like to get in before coin goes up 100× like Sia


[24-Jun-18 06:41 PM] Airman#0374
As i understand you can use your PC with Linux for mining. No special rigs available now.


[24-Jun-18 06:44 PM] Airman#0374
And according to available documents 3 major points will be important. 1. CPU. 2. Storage space (your hard drive volume). 3. Internet link speed.


[24-Jun-18 08:39 PM] Spraffers#8357
What is considered suitable storage space??   1tb?    100tb?


[24-Jun-18 08:40 PM] Airman#0374
Than more than better i guess:)


[24-Jun-18 08:41 PM] Spraffers#8357
Yeah i assumed that, i was asking what is suitable, or what is the minimum


[24-Jun-18 08:42 PM] Airman#0374
It is no minimal requirements in any guides

So mining for us 'normal people' hasn't started yet? haha


[26-Jun-18 09:54 AM] arweave-india#5075
Haha @Bicepsueel What do you mean by normal people?   There is no inflation schedule yet - that's due to commence after the softonboarding process ends. Drop me a DM if you have any queries


[26-Jun-18 09:55 AM] arweave-india#5075
@lecar I'll drop you an email now

Amy you will need to setup a Linux box


[28-Jun-18 05:35 AM] Vilenarios#8742
They have a github package and basic instructions


[28-Jun-18 05:47 AM] Vilenarios#8742
But they haven’t publicly listed mining IP address yet... or at least not that I could find


[28-Jun-18 08:11 PM] Amy#5900
@Vilenarios i  don t  konw how to do a  initial synt, i don t  get  the mining pool ip address, how to get  this? and how how to set up linux box ,How do you do that?


[28-Jun-18 09:44 PM] Amy#5900
@Vilenarios  you said is this https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave#ubuntudebian-linux-quickstart


[29-Jun-18 07:21 AM] Mike#2447
After you get your Debian/Ubuntu installation all set and up to date, you can  open a terminal and run the following commands one line at a time.  I changed the Erlang version from 20.1 in the original instructions to the newer 20.3 release.  Version 21.0 is out, but I don't know if there are compatibility issues or not.

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y gcc make build-essential autoconf m4 libncurses5-dev libssh-dev unixodbc-dev openjdk-8-jdk libwxgtk3.0-dev xsltproc fop
wget http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_20.3.tar.gz
tar -zvxf otp_src_20.3.tar.gz
cd otp_src_20.3
export ERL_TOP=`pwd`
./configure
make
sudo make install
cd ../
sudo apt-get install -y git
git clone https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave.git

After cloning the repo, enter the  following commands to test your setup.  If everything completes with "OK", you should be ready to mine.

cd arweave
make all tnt

Once the peer IP list is released to the public you can mine with the following command.
./arweave-server mine peer XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX

Or you can run with the polling flag if you have issues with forwarding port 1984.
./arweave-server mine polling peer XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX

I'm fairly certain this information is all correct, but if a member of the dev team wants to jump in and comment it would be appreciated.


[29-Jun-18 07:27 AM] Marcin#0065
But. If you start mining, how will the reward be directed to you? You do not privide any ar adress or whatsoever. There must be a different way


[29-Jun-18 07:27 AM] NewbieFT#9201
It auto creates a new address and wallet


[29-Jun-18 07:29 AM] tierralibre#2740
Is way easier to install erlang packages than compile them


[29-Jun-18 07:30 AM] Jinbin Xie Huobi Ventures#2044
When can I get an ip address?


[29-Jun-18 07:30 AM] tierralibre#2740
elixir lang has info on installing erlang


[29-Jun-18 07:32 AM] tierralibre#2740
https://elixir-lang.org/install.html


[29-Jun-18 07:33 AM] tierralibre#2740
@Marcin  there is an option to provide address for mining as well


[29-Jun-18 07:33 AM] tierralibre#2740
if not creates a new one


[29-Jun-18 07:33 AM] Vilenarios#8742
But what is the polling per address??


[29-Jun-18 07:34 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Sorry, polling peer address...  is that available yet?


[29-Jun-18 07:39 AM] Mike#2447
No peer IP addresses have been released.  Everything I posted above is publicly available information from the team's GitHub, email updates or from this Discord.


[29-Jun-18 07:40 AM] Mike#2447
If you want to mine to a specific address use the flag "mining_addr" and enter the address after that.


[29-Jun-18 07:42 AM] Mike#2447
For example
./arweave-server mine peer XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX mining_addr WALLETADDRESS


[30-Jun-18 08:19 AM] digamma889#3785
Does anyone have a reference implementation in terms of hardware for Arweave?


[30-Jun-18 10:55 AM] Scalefinity#7851
@guys, some peers:

[30-Jun-18 05:55 PM] Vilenarios#8742
How can I tel my hash rate and overall miner performance?


[01-Jul-18 12:14 PM] JJ#6818
can  anyone send or post a link to a mining guide for Windows? I've DM'd @arweave-india a while ago but haven't had a response.


[01-Jul-18 01:10 PM] Airman#0374
as i know they have no mining software for windows now


[01-Jul-18 01:14 PM] Airman#0374
in this guide https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave is Windows Quickstart, but i didnt test it, and team said early that they have no windows SW


[01-Jul-18 01:17 PM] arweave-sam#9630
You can setup the environment using Windows Subsystem for Linux, currently, but this is quite an involved process.


[01-Jul-18 01:18 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We will be releasing a native bundled miner when it is ready.


[01-Jul-18 01:19 PM] Mike#2447
Everything seems to be running fine for me in a Linux virtual machine guest on Windows host.


[01-Jul-18 01:19 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Once you have Windows Subsystem for Linux setup you can setup the environment just like you would for a Linux machine.


[01-Jul-18 01:20 PM] arweave-sam#9630
> Everything seems to be running fine for me in a Linux virtual machine guest on Windows host.

Yes, this is another approach, too


[01-Jul-18 02:25 PM] arweave-india#5075
@JJ Apologies for missing your DM, I have responded and I will email you now  


[01-Jul-18 08:22 PM] Amy#5900
@Mike  how to get ip ?


[01-Jul-18 08:27 PM] Amy#5900
@Mike  Can virtual machine run mining environment?


[02-Jul-18 02:38 AM] Scalefinity#7851

so far how many AR can be mine per day?


[02-Jul-18 05:34 AM] Embiei|MassStake#8665
Guys, i have been on holidays, the IP to mine is already available?? i am subscribed to email (recieved the Get ready to mine the Arweave! email)


[02-Jul-18 05:49 AM] arweave-india#5075
@Embiei|MassStake At the moment we haven't emailed out the mining IPs - apologies for the delay, we had planned to get them out before now, but this is a priority for this week


[02-Jul-18 05:49 AM] Embiei|MassStake#8665
Oki, thanks  


[02-Jul-18 05:50 AM] arweave-india#5075
@mickey At the moment we haven't publicly released the mining IPs to the mining mailing list, and the soft onboarding stage means that the inflation schedule hasn't yet begun, just so you know.


[02-Jul-18 08:07 AM] Blasco#9303
@arweave-india when I need to subscribe for get that email with the ips?


[02-Jul-18 08:07 AM] Blasco#9303
There will be any pool for. Mining? Or only solo-mining?


[02-Jul-18 08:29 AM] Mike#2447
@Scalefinity In my experience, running make clean will delete all your downloaded blocks.


[02-Jul-18 08:30 AM] Mike#2447
@Amy Yes, I've been running in a virtual environment.  I don't think the loss of CPU performance is that significant.


[02-Jul-18 08:31 AM] Mike#2447
@arweave-india Is it possible to clearly explain the terms "soft onboarding" and "inflation schedule"?


[02-Jul-18 09:01 AM] arweave-india#5075
@Mike The inflation schedule is the generation of new tokens in the Arweave network. This won't be starting for another couple of months, giving people time to set up their rigs. The 'soft onboarding' stage is how we describe this period without the inflation schedule - this is described further in the introductory mining email. Let me know if you haven't received this and you would like to


[02-Jul-18 09:02 AM] arweave-india#5075
@Blasco You can sign up to the mining mailing list any time by emailing me at india@arweave.org

There are no mining pools available


[02-Jul-18 09:12 AM] Airman#0374
In another words in this period (soft onboarding) mining will not profitable for miners? Am i right?


[02-Jul-18 09:16 AM] arweave-india#5075
@Airman Yes that is effectively correct. If you'd like to join the mailing list to receive mining updates feel free to email me at india@arweave.org and I can add you, plus email you the introductory email


[02-Jul-18 09:19 AM] Airman#0374
Thank you India, i am there already and my rig is configured up and waiting:)


[02-Jul-18 10:43 AM] Vilenarios#8742
What rig you running?


[02-Jul-18 10:44 AM] Airman#0374
linux on my laptop


[02-Jul-18 05:52 PM] Vilenarios#8742
How often is the Progress Report message supposed to come up? Hard to tell if my miner is working or frozen


[02-Jul-18 06:42 PM] arweave-sam#9630
If you open another terminal in the arweave directory and run 'make log' you will see more in-depth messages. The system is built to leave the default console clear of logging so that you can interact with the console  cleanly.


[02-Jul-18 06:44 PM] NewbieFT#9201
The introductory email has been sent out already with IP?


[02-Jul-18 08:08 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Thank you Sam.


[02-Jul-18 08:27 PM] Vilenarios#8742
What’s the size of the blockweave now?


[02-Jul-18 08:28 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Or I guess it’s just going to use as much storage as it can?


[02-Jul-18 08:58 PM] Amy#5900
@Airman  How is your rig configured？


[02-Jul-18 10:04 PM] mickey#7342
if using laptop mean using external hard drive, right? Haha i still got a 7-8 years old laptop, not sure can use to setup for this mining as only got usb 2.0


[02-Jul-18 10:18 PM] Airman#0374
@Amy What you mean exactly? This is my home laptop. You can search this chat for step by step configuration.  Or you can find it on github.


[02-Jul-18 10:23 PM] Amy#5900
@AirmanAre you using Windows or Linux virtual machines?


[02-Jul-18 10:23 PM] Airman#0374
@mickey  I didnt used external HD, it is just for testing. So a tried to configure my old laptop too, but it is very slow even with linux onboard. It has SCSI HD, but just 1GB of RAM.  So i think the RAM is more critical in this case.


[02-Jul-18 10:24 PM] Airman#0374
@Amy No it is only native OS onboard.


[02-Jul-18 10:26 PM] Airman#0374
I mean it is only Linux installed on my laptop. No any virtualization.


[02-Jul-18 10:26 PM] Amy#5900
what is meaning?


[02-Jul-18 10:27 PM] Amy#5900
What needs to be configured in the linux  system?


[02-Jul-18 10:29 PM] Airman#0374
I didnt configure any special things. Just did it step by step like described in guide


[02-Jul-18 10:33 PM] Amy#5900
Isn't an IP address required in the guide?How do you get your IP address?

@Airman is there any hash rate display? just to determine what is slow vs moderate vs fast mining speed/rate

I keep getting {could not start fork recovery} {target block hash list incorrect}


[03-Jul-18 07:08 AM] Scalefinity#7851
since the source code of so called "mainnet" is updated every day, to make sure that you are running the latest code with:
close the node with control+c
git pull
make clean
make all
start the node


[03-Jul-18 07:09 AM] Scalefinity#7851
the project is far away to the productive. just wait for an official statement of the developer


[03-Jul-18 07:09 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I agree bioharz... very long way from production release. Glad I still get to play around though.


[03-Jul-18 07:09 AM] Scalefinity#7851
I don't not what the "mainnet" launch was. But ar itself is not ready for production.


[03-Jul-18 07:13 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Did they answer your question about large block size?


[03-Jul-18 07:36 AM] arweave-india#5075
@Vilenarios Yep you can read the discussion in the dev channel here on Discord


[03-Jul-18 07:54 AM] arweave-india#5075
@Vilenarios You'll need to rejoin the network on a peer. Happy to point you to a direct message with one of the devs if you need some more help


[03-Jul-18 07:57 AM] arweave-india#5075
> I don't not what the "mainnet" launch was. But ar itself is not ready for production.

People have been using the network for archiving for weeks now, since mainnet launch.


[03-Jul-18 08:27 AM] flamesx#4524
@Scalefinity : can you explain why do you think the project is far from productive?


[03-Jul-18 09:39 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Sorry India, I really meant from a perspective of a public miner. Just seems like a lack of info... but I’m aware the team is working on this.


[03-Jul-18 11:08 AM] arweave-india#5075
Yes that's right we're getting documents prepared and an update out this week, thanks for your patience while we put everything together


[03-Jul-18 01:17 PM] Vilenarios#8742
@arweave-sam This was working but then I did a clean build. Now when I do make log it says no recipe for target ‘log’ failed


[03-Jul-18 01:17 PM] Vilenarios#8742
The log directory is empty, even after starting my node


[03-Jul-18 01:21 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Thanks for the report. Does the 'logs' directory currently exist?


[03-Jul-18 01:28 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Yes it does. And it’s empty


[03-Jul-18 01:59 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Ok, thank you. I will talk to the development team about this and get back to you.


[03-Jul-18 03:07 PM] Airman#0374
@arweave-sam How can we see hashrate and other statistics?

Thats fine. If you use the master branch as a development brach.
But, the ar team use the master branch as a production branch.


[03-Jul-18 03:51 PM] Scalefinity#7851
What's about the release?
https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/releases
released this on 5 Apr


[03-Jul-18 03:51 PM] Scalefinity#7851
so, forget the releases...


[03-Jul-18 03:52 PM] Scalefinity#7851
we have to use the master branches for production. even if you update it every day.


[03-Jul-18 03:55 PM] Scalefinity#7851
compare the oldest, most stable blockchain:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commits/master
as you can see, there were also commits, nearly every day.
but the were also several branches:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/branches/all
stable branches, like 0.16, updated 20 days ago
or 0.15, Updated 2 months ago

and the were stable releases:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
Bitcoin Core 0.16.1, released this 18 days ago 
Bitcoin Core 0.16.0,  released this on 26 Feb


[03-Jul-18 04:05 PM] Scalefinity#7851
look, I'm a developer. I we are working with SCRUM, the SCRUM board, code review and so on.
Our master branch is only for stable releases. We also have a dev branches, every finished work item(with a own branch, passed all tests, code reviewed, tested with a own testing department)  land in the dev branch. After a cycle of two weeks, the testing department test a a snapshot of the dev build. If the test passed, we commit the dev changes to the master branches and push the update to our clients and backend system.

it doesn't matter if you have a different branch naming system. They are many  approaches for that.
But if don't have any releases at all, thats a big mess. That's hacking code.
It's fine to hack code for web development. 
But in blockchain space, it's different. Your team play around with money. Your team actually play around also with my money.

I really think you seriously need at least one software engineer/Software architect.


[03-Jul-18 04:05 PM] Scalefinity#7851
@arweave-sam


[03-Jul-18 04:10 PM] Scalefinity#7851
And I also think you need more developers:
https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/graphs/contributors
I really hope that atleast to have some sort of code review.
I really want to help you out. For example, there is no dnsseed implementation at all.
But, I don't speak Erlang. I do java EE, JS, Angular, C, Rust... I also have a deep understanding of Bitcoin, atomic swap, lightning network and some knowledge about ethereum.


[03-Jul-18 04:13 PM] Scalefinity#7851
I'm just a careful developer.
It isn't just an experiment. You are playing around with money. With peoples money. So, please, be careful.
I now,  You have no money to lose, just the stupid money which come in in your ICO can lose...
But don't foget, you have a repudiation to lose...


[03-Jul-18 04:17 PM] Scalefinity#7851
That's not FUD at all. I'm a early investor of your project. It's the only ICO which I'm "invested". I'm actually a maximalist. But I found your idea interesting.
And as a developer, I know that sometimes you need a different view of the things, so I hope my critical view may help you.

i also expose to code revision before but just coding c/c++ haha, been use clearcase, svn and git before, usually main/master repo is for the release, development at checkout branch, once testcase passing then commit/merge into main/master repo for releases


[04-Jul-18 05:30 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hi bioharz, the core key points regarding these issues:
1. The commit programme we have been following so far is atomic -- meaning that each individual, working, feature is committed to master. Of course we will change this once the mining Its are officially released (very soon...).


[04-Jul-18 05:31 AM] arweave-sam#9630
2. Of course, the code has been reviewed by NCC group (the same group that audited ZCash).
3. Yes, we are hiring to build out our development team.


[04-Jul-18 05:39 AM] Scalefinity#7851
@arweave-sam 
Thank you very much for your quick response.
Regarding the first point. It's okey at all. Development is hard. specially blockchain development. Take your time, really. But claiming that the "mainnet" has already launched in this stadium is little bit to much.


[05-Jul-18 10:57 AM] Marcin#0065
If i set up a second hard drive and execute the mining from that drive, will if save blocks on that specific drive only?


[05-Jul-18 11:02 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yes


[05-Jul-18 11:03 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You can also mount the arweave/blocks directory on its own device if you like


[05-Jul-18 11:05 AM] Vilenarios#8742
How can you change the default location of arweave/blocks ?


[05-Jul-18 11:15 AM] arweave-india#5075
@Vilenarios For now, you can't configure the default location for storing blocks. However, as Sam mentioned above you can mount the blocks directory on a different drive. Similarly, as Marcin said above, you can also just place the Arweave installation where you would like the blocks to be stored.


[05-Jul-18 01:28 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Thank you India. If you can’t tell, I’m a Linux noob.

You can even mount multiple devices under the same directory. I did this as I had a 150gb limitation per disk.

When mining, what does "alarm_handler: {set,{system_memory_high_watermark,[]}}" indicate?


[06-Jul-18 09:37 AM] arweave-india#5075
@Mike Please could you drop me a PM to discuss your setup? Thanks!


[06-Jul-18 12:08 PM] Mike#2447
I am mining with the polling flag and got this error, causing the Arweave server to hang.

Error in process <0.746.0> with exit value:
{{badrecord,block},
 [{ar_poller,server,3,[{file,"src/ar_poller.erl"},{line,29}]}]}

The identified line 29 in src/ar_poller.erl is:

NewB#block.height,


[06-Jul-18 12:08 PM] Mike#2447
Are these "bug reports" helpful to the team?


[06-Jul-18 12:16 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Hi @Mike, it is best to use port forwarding, rather than polling, as it is substantially more efficient. You just need port 1984 to forward to your machine on your local network -- this can usually be configured by your router.

Reports like these are always helpful, but probably best to send them directly to @arweave-india who can collective the details and add issues directly to our internal tracking system.


[06-Jul-18 12:16 PM] arweave-sam#9630
*collect


[06-Jul-18 12:30 PM] Mike#2447
Sounds good.  I'm typically forwarding port 1984, but in this instance it's not possible.  So is this likely a bug in the polling implementation?


[06-Jul-18 12:36 PM] arweave-sam#9630
The poller will only speak to nodes that you specifically mention in the command line opts -- how many nodes are you listing there?


[06-Jul-18 12:45 PM] Mike#2447
Interesting.  I only listed 2.


[06-Jul-18 12:47 PM] Mike#2447
When I check my stats, I am connected to 44.


[06-Jul-18 12:47 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Thanks -- good to know


[06-Jul-18 12:48 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Poller is built to allow you to be specific about the peers you poll


[06-Jul-18 12:48 PM] arweave-sam#9630
As wildfire will severely punish you for never giving other nodes useful data


[06-Jul-18 12:49 PM] arweave-sam#9630
(Except the occasional block you mine yourself)


[06-Jul-18 12:49 PM] arweave-sam#9630
So polling is setup so that you would make an agreement for another node to whitelist you, then 'piggyback' off their reputation


[06-Jul-18 12:52 PM] Mike#2447
Thanks for the tip Sam!  I think it puts the community at ease seeing more of the dev team popping in here.


[06-Jul-18 12:58 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yeah, understood


[06-Jul-18 12:59 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We have been flat out with hiring and sale/wallet on-boarding recently, so didn't have much time to chat here


[06-Jul-18 01:00 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Before that there were sales, main net development, and Techstars that kept us all exceptionally busy


[06-Jul-18 01:00 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Glad to have more time to talk to the community here

[06-Jul-18 01:45 PM] Mike#2447
Another question:  On one of my rigs, when I join the network it downloads 50 blocks, but on another rig it only downloads 25 blocks.  Why the difference?


[06-Jul-18 01:46 PM] arweave-sam#9630
The 25 block miner is not running the latest software


[06-Jul-18 01:46 PM] Mike#2447
LOL


[06-Jul-18 01:46 PM] Mike#2447

Hey guys


[07-Jul-18 02:48 PM] tadaams#6474
I need to mine on gpu


[07-Jul-18 02:48 PM] tadaams#6474
Is it possible


[07-Jul-18 02:49 PM] tadaams#6474
What are the system requirements and tutorial on mining


[07-Jul-18 04:52 PM] arweave-india#5075
Hi @tadaams - at the moment, the most efficient way to mine is with CPUs. If you drop me a PM with your email address I can make sure that you get on the mailing list to receive all of the system requirements and set up information.


[08-Jul-18 01:39 AM] Marcin#0065
Any official mining announcment came out already?


[08-Jul-18 07:27 AM] arweave-india#5075
Not quite yet Marcin


[08-Jul-18 12:42 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Just to double check, I shouldn’t be receiving any AR even though I’m actively mining now, right?


[08-Jul-18 12:42 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Whether inflation or tx fees?


[08-Jul-18 12:52 PM] Mike#2447
You should eventually score some tx fees.  I dont think any new AR are being mined though.


[08-Jul-18 12:52 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Got it. Thanks. Don’t think ive gotten any since my wallet is still the same amount but I’ll keep an eye out.


[09-Jul-18 12:57 PM] digamma889#3785
Is there anything that could be communicated as to why the release of the ip keeps getting delayed?


[09-Jul-18 01:01 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We are putting together a pretty expansive guide on how to start mining the Arweave. Part of this is making the setup easier for new miners and ensuring support for the 3 major operating systems.

If you would like to get started right away, however, people here have provided the IP addresses. Please remember that during this on-boarding period you will only receive transaction rewards, rather than inflation-based block rewards.


[09-Jul-18 08:04 PM] Amy#5900
@arweave-sam  When will there be a fairly extensive guide to mining?


[09-Jul-18 10:21 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Been mining for a couple weeks now and no TX fees at all - is that expected or am I doing something incorrectly?  Not sure how frequent it is


[09-Jul-18 10:23 PM] Jinbin Xie Huobi Ventures#2044
how to mining？


[09-Jul-18 10:24 PM] Jinbin Xie Huobi Ventures#2044
where is the peer ip？


[10-Jul-18 12:54 AM] tiamat#9131
yes, any news when we'll receive the peer ips?


[10-Jul-18 03:22 AM] arweave-india#5075
You can search and find the peers in this channel, but we will be releasing an extensive mining guide (including IPs) ourselves soon to our mining mailing list. 

If you're not already on our mining-specific mailing list and you would like to be, please drop me an email at india@arweave.org from your preferred email address and I will add you, and forward the previous email to you also.


[12-Jul-18 05:33 AM] codybartfast#9308
Hi, I've been mining for few days.  I think things are working as I've managed to earn 0.016 AR (or perhaps 0.016 + new-wallet-fee AR) presumably from transaction fees.  

I've been watching the number of files in the 'blocks' and 'txs' directories and  the (Ubunutu) System Monitor as ways of trying to 'see' what's happening.

There seems to be a pattern whereby the CPU usage eventually gets pegged at 100% (very roughly after an hour or so).  Once that happens block download seems to slow considerably to the point where it all but stops.  But, if I restart the server (clt-c, a) block download resumes until the CPU gets pegged again.  E.g. leaving it running for 8 hours, 0 blocks were download in last 6 hours, but after restarting 200 blocks were download in an hour.  

Is this expected behaviour?

I'm running Ubuntu 18.04 under Hyper-V with 4 cores and 8GB RAM available to the VM.


[12-Jul-18 05:46 AM] arweave-india#5075
@codybartfast Would you mind emailing Kyle about this directly (including what command used to start the server including the IP you're connecting with?) so he can troubleshoot with you? His email is kyle@arweave.org. Thanks!


[12-Jul-18 06:01 AM] codybartfast#9308
Will do.  Thanks


[12-Jul-18 06:13 AM] arweave-india#5075
Thanks  


[13-Jul-18 07:37 AM] Mike#2447
I have almost 1 GB of blocks stored in the "invalid" folder.  Are they needed for anything?  Can those be deleted?


[13-Jul-18 08:05 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Those can be safely deleted

[14-Jul-18 11:39 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @Omeed - Blocktech Studios, short answer is yes regarding dual CPU server. We're optimised for storage first, and CPU second, and we don't optimise for GPU at all. So more CPU power will improve your mining performance.


[14-Jul-18 11:42 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
More cores will mean more hashing power, and generally more physical cores is going to be better than more logical/virtual cores.


[14-Jul-18 12:03 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @Marcin yeah that's correct. We broadcast a message from that address if there's a new node version to update to


[14-Jul-18 12:04 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
The log message should have a mention of updating around it

okay. as far i see the log is showing some activity. the pc is now running fulltime.
in case i throw a bigger harddrive into the pc, copy the arweave folder to the new disk, will i be able to execute the mining from the new path wihtout downloading all blocks again?

Yeah you should just be able to install the node software on a new machine, then just copy across the block and tx directories and in theory you should be good to go

Hmmm ok


[14-Jul-18 01:18 PM] Marcin#0065
i got 124 block from previous tryouts


[14-Jul-18 01:18 PM] arthur#6010
@arweave-kyle I've only tried with AWS linux since I already had it on a server running. I will try with ubuntu tomorrow.


[14-Jul-18 01:18 PM] Marcin#0065
but since then no new blocks came in


[14-Jul-18 01:19 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Please can you leave it running for a few hours/overnight and see if the situation changes, then DM us the results?


[14-Jul-18 01:19 PM] Marcin#0065
alright, no problem


[14-Jul-18 01:19 PM] arweave-sam#9630

[14-Jul-18 01:19 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Sure


[14-Jul-18 01:20 PM] Marcin#0065
i had to put the command  "mine" to the front, before the peers. otherwise it didnt work out. in the readme the comman mine is at the very end, after the peers. that didnt work out for me


[14-Jul-18 01:21 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Interesting, please can you DM us the different commands you used directly from your 'history' output?

replaced with my mining address accordingly


[14-Jul-18 01:26 PM] enti#1418
from what Marcin has pasted, the "mine" part has to be removed ? It was within the email


[14-Jul-18 01:27 PM] arweave-sam#9630
No, the mine part needs to be there


[14-Jul-18 01:28 PM] Marcin#0065
no no, its all fine. all i did was put the mine afer "arweave-server" believing its working then. but its working all fine. i had an error caused by something else then


[14-Jul-18 01:29 PM] enti#1418
you told me to remove the protocol from my problematic IP, 209.97.142.143, which is the last one from the command line

@enti ah okay, so with that command it’s still not working? Which OS are you running on?


[14-Jul-18 02:48 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
@Marcin awesome!  


[14-Jul-18 03:21 PM] Marcin#0065
how do miners check that blocks have they mined or what transaction feed have been earned?
will there be anything to check on in future? at the moment its not that relevant i know, but later on?


[14-Jul-18 05:01 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @Marcin, we have a block explorer in the works that’ll be here soon and you’ll be able to see that information on there


[14-Jul-18 06:01 PM] JamJam 17#3072
@arweave-kyle any ETA for the Explorer?


[14-Jul-18 06:01 PM] rocket11122#4386
Hi admin, I would like to join our mining team


[14-Jul-18 06:02 PM] rocket11122#4386
is there any guideline?


[14-Jul-18 06:03 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I actually saw a test version of the explorer today -- looks great! No fixed release date yet but it is coming soon.


[14-Jul-18 06:12 PM] enti#1418
@arweave-kyle ubuntu 16.04


[14-Jul-18 06:56 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
@enti, we recommend Ubuntu 18.04, IIRC the version that ships with 16.04 is not going to be up to date enough. If you try the install.sh version it’ll compile the correct version of Erlang so that should in theory work even on 16.04


[14-Jul-18 07:07 PM] tadaams#6474
Any body succeed with mining?


[14-Jul-18 07:08 PM] tadaams#6474
How many arweave mined


[14-Jul-18 07:26 PM] tadaams#6474
@arweave-sam any ETA for Windows?


[14-Jul-18 08:23 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We can see from the (in testing) block explorer thatany other miners are getting blocks :)


[14-Jul-18 08:24 PM] arweave-sam#9630
You can already mine on Windows if you use the Windows Subsystem for Linux


[14-Jul-18 08:24 PM] bitcoinBeliever&30k_by_2020#6947
how many arweave can we mine per hour?

Estimations?


[15-Jul-18 01:01 AM] Marcin#0065
any other way to download all blocks? around 264 over night downloaded, pretty slow :/


[15-Jul-18 04:25 AM] codybartfast#9308
Well done to the team on the greatly improved mining software. Thank you.  

I have it running on WSL (Unbuntu 16.04), on Windows 10, on a home network, behind a consumer wireless router.  I'd just like share a few things from my experience...


[15-Jul-18 04:25 AM] codybartfast#9308
.

## Getting the Latest Erlang on WSL Ubuntu

apt-get seemed to only install Erlang 18, this site: https://hostpresto.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-erlang-on-ubuntu-16-04/ has instructions for getting the latest version of Erlang.  The main commands are:

wget https://packages.erlang-solutions.com/erlang-solutions_1.0_all.deb 

sudo dpkg -i erlang-solutions_1.0_all.deb

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install erlang

I then received Erlang 21


[15-Jul-18 04:26 AM] codybartfast#9308
.

## Opening the Windows Firewall port.

Once the mining node is running I needed to open the port in the Windows Firewall.

First I checked it was accessible locally with http://127.0.0.1:1984/info

These are some generic instructions for allowing an inbound connection: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/windows-firewall/create-an-inbound-port-rule

The options I chose used were:

    type: port

    protocol: tcp
    specific local port: 1984

    Action:  Allow the Connection

    Profile: All

    Name: Arweave

Once the firewall was open I could access the node from another machine on the network using its private address:  e.g., http://192.168.abc.xyz:1984/info


[15-Jul-18 04:26 AM] codybartfast#9308
.

## Port Forwarding

On my wifi router I first created a DHCP lease reservation (giving the node a fixed IP address) then I could create a Port forwarding rule from 1984 (external port) to 1984 (internal port) with the fixed ip address of the node.  How this is done is very different for every router manufacturer.

To test it I googled "What's my IP" from my home network to get my public IP Address.  Then from my phone, using the mobile network (i.e., with Wi-Fi disabled), I checked I had access to http://a.b.c.d:1984/info where a.b.c.d is my public IP address.

Once that worked the node was able to join the weave.

Hey @tierralibre - I have forwarded the guide to you via email and will confirm you're on the mining mailing list for future updates


[15-Jul-18 12:00 PM] tierralibre#2740
Thank you!


[15-Jul-18 12:00 PM] tierralibre#2740
Is there a way to update code without losing blocks?


[15-Jul-18 12:01 PM] tierralibre#2740
It looks like master changes a lot


[15-Jul-18 12:05 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
@tierralibre updates won’t change the block and tx directories so you should be fine to update. If you’re unsure you can install the node software again in a different directory and then copy across the contents of block and tx directories from your existing install. Alternatively you could backup the contents of the block and tx directories before you update.


[15-Jul-18 12:07 PM] tierralibre#2740
Thank you! I will try!

[15-Jul-18 02:28 PM] tadaams#6474
@arweave-india hey will the code run on arm pc?


[15-Jul-18 08:21 PM] Amy#5900
@arweave-kyle  hello,How to achieve soft landing


[16-Jul-18 04:20 AM] arweave-india#5075
@tadaams I'll have to look into this for you - as far as I know we haven't done any testing on ARM machines, but I'll ask for you about the potential possibility.


[16-Jul-18 04:38 AM] arthur#6010
Is there a benefit of using an SSD instead of HDD for storage?


[16-Jul-18 06:05 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @Amy, sorry not sure I understand your question , is it in relation to soft onboarding for mining?


[16-Jul-18 06:07 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
@tadaams it's not something we've tested, but our recommended OS is ubuntu 18.04 and that supports ARM architectures so it might be possible


[16-Jul-18 06:08 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
It's not something we specifically support but it looks like it might work, assuming everything compiles correctly


[16-Jul-18 06:09 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
We can look into it in future, but if you have some hardware and you try it do let us know how you get on


[16-Jul-18 06:13 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
@arthur Currently there's not really a notable benefit to SSDs over HDDs in the system, nodes rank each other based on speed of access over the network which will almost always be a bigger bottleneck than HDD vs SDD access speed. Currently blocks and transactions are stored in individual files on your machine but if this changes in future to a different storage format with compression etc then it might possibly make more of a difference then, but this is speculation at the moment


[16-Jul-18 08:05 AM] Mike#2447
Has the team already determined what block will trigger the inflation schedule?


[16-Jul-18 08:07 AM] arthur#6010
Is there an option to start the miner with a custom location for the block data? For example I'd like to store the data in /data


[16-Jul-18 08:36 AM] arthur#6010
Another thing, I have the miner running but sometimes get these messages:
```
=INFO REPORT==== 16-Jul-2018::13:36:06 ===
    could_not_start_mining
    stored_recall_block_for_foreign_verification
```
Does this mean the miner doesn't work?


[16-Jul-18 08:40 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You can move the storage medium using your mounts in /etc/database.

That message is fine, it means that you don't have the required recall block to mine the next block, but you will resume mining when there is a new block you do have the recall block for.


[16-Jul-18 09:02 AM] arweave-india#5075
@Marcin I just had a chat with Sam on the phone, and he mentioned that the very last error message you reported is actually due to the fact that someone else on the network is running an outdated version of the software - it isn't because of any problem with your set up


[16-Jul-18 12:06 PM] Marcin#0065
thanks @arweave-india , i had my pc running for 2 days, got 1000 blocks downloaded. a bit slow as for me, but its progressing. id like to have all block soon and be up to date


[16-Jul-18 12:21 PM] arthur#6010
I'm also concerned about the download time of the blocks. So far I've downloaded ~200 blocks per hour and with the current block height of 25000 it will take me over 5 days to catch up


[16-Jul-18 12:23 PM] arthur#6010
Would it be possible to provide a snapshot of the blocks data that we can download and use as a starting point for the miner?


[16-Jul-18 12:45 PM] Marcin#0065
200 block per hour? a wet dream to me xD


[16-Jul-18 04:29 PM] tadaams#6474
@arweave-kyle I see, i might try to do that during this weekend.  If its arch independent it might build straight. But then if you have used any sse optimization for x86. Idk. Please hit me up with link for latest code base.


[16-Jul-18 07:18 PM] NewbieFT#9201
its way too slow to download blocks


[16-Jul-18 07:27 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Hey Sunny, Marcin, ak1, we added an artificial delay to the process of downloading old blocks for the opening phase. This is temporary and will be removed very soon. We did this because we wanted to (and have) avoided a situation where hundreds/thousands of new miners request the ~20gb of the Arweave already generated at exactly the same moment, from a comparatively low number of peers.


[16-Jul-18 07:28 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@Marcin though, your download speed seems much slower than it should be (~200 blocks an hour), however. What kind of connection are you using?


[16-Jul-18 08:58 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Hi all. Just set up mining on windows subsystem for linux


[16-Jul-18 08:58 PM] Vilenarios#8742
So far so good.


[16-Jul-18 08:58 PM] Vilenarios#8742
When I run the benchmark test it doesn’t seem to be using all of my cpu.


[16-Jul-18 08:59 PM] Vilenarios#8742
2444987 h/s/core for intel i9-7920x


[16-Jul-18 08:59 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Anyone else care to share their hash numbers?


[16-Jul-18 09:10 PM] Vilenarios#8742
And is there a list of the available arweave-Server  commands?


[16-Jul-18 09:15 PM] arweave-sam#9630
That is correct -- the numbers given there are per active core


[16-Jul-18 09:16 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Does that number stack up to you guys?


[16-Jul-18 09:18 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I get ~1.9mh/s/core on my 3.1GHZ Core i5


[16-Jul-18 09:19 PM] arweave-sam#9630
But this is a laptop not connected to power, so it may be throttled somewhat


[16-Jul-18 09:19 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Okay. So perhaps my Ubuntu terminal is being throttled. I have 24 cores to use so I’d like to get at least half utilization if possible


[16-Jul-18 09:22 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yes, by default you will be running 23x ~2.5mh/s with the main server


[16-Jul-18 09:22 PM] arweave-sam#9630
That output only shows you one core


[16-Jul-18 09:23 PM] arweave-sam#9630
But you will run (number of cores) - 1 miner by default


[16-Jul-18 09:23 PM] arweave-sam#9630
*miners


[16-Jul-18 09:24 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Good to know. I’ll keep my eye on performance. So far like 140 blocks in 10 mins.


[16-Jul-18 09:24 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Is make log supposed to stop showing new info? Like I have to run make log every time I want to see the updated log?


[16-Jul-18 09:25 PM] arweave-sam#9630
No, make log should continually show new events


[16-Jul-18 09:26 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Got it.


[16-Jul-18 09:26 PM] arweave-sam#9630
But sometimes are there are gaps between events taking place


[16-Jul-18 09:27 PM] Vilenarios#8742
And one last question Sam. What commands do I have to interact with arweave-Server? Is there a readme or something I am missing with this info?


[16-Jul-18 09:27 PM] st$egg#8289
Hey @arweave-sam My withdrawal from Upvest not working even after following all instructions and leaving some AR behind in the wallet. I just does not get passed the "confirm transaction" blue button. Please help.


[16-Jul-18 09:29 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Most of the commands you might use in that terminal for now are related to debugging. We plan to allow the user to set various attributes of the miner  through this terminal later, but for now they are a bit too user un-friendly for normal operation.


[16-Jul-18 09:30 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@st$egg please can you contact Upvest's support directly. I am afraid I cannot help you with issues with their wallet.

@Vilenarios  @arweave-sam thanks for sharing your numbers. I have 1807011 h/s/core on an aws c5.xlarge instance. This is probably because of its vCPUs


[17-Jul-18 02:17 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep, do Amazon actually tell you the clock speed of the underlying hardware? Would be interesting to know. A 'vCPU' doesn't mean a huge amount on its own.


[17-Jul-18 02:19 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Would also be interesting to know how much the h/s/core differs depending on the load of the other hosts on the (physical) machine

[17-Jul-18 03:28 AM] mickey#7342
i got a couple of noob questions

1) let say if network internet speed and hard disk drive are constant and the CPU is a variable
   - A mining rig has 4 cores and 1 core hashrate is 2.5mh/s while B mining rig has 8 cores with same hashrate 2.5mh/s
   - A mining rig can mine 1 AR per day, is it B mining rig will be at least double, mine 2.33 AR per day ??? 
    ( 1 AR x 7 x 2.5mh/s ) / ( 3 x 2.5mh/s) = 2.33 AR 

2) let say if network internet speed and CPU are constant and hard disk drive is a variable
   - A mining rig has 10TB while B mining rig has 20TB
   - A mining rig can mine 1 AR per day, will B mining rig mine double , 2 AR per day ???


[17-Jul-18 04:41 AM] Omeed - Blocktech Studios#2608
Hello, is there any tangible benefit to exceeding the 8gb of RAM recommendations as a minimum?


[17-Jul-18 06:01 AM] arthur#6010
I've only been running for a day but ram usage is 1.3GB


[17-Jul-18 06:02 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I have 32GB of ram but only been mining for a day. Will share my numbers once available. I don’t expect to see any benefit but will be good info.


[17-Jul-18 08:01 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
@mickey 

1) yeah as you've correctly pointed out it's 3 mining cores vs 7. Currently the node will mine on the number of logical cores - 1, so 3 vs 7 not 4 vs 8.

2) You don't earn AR directly based on the amount of free storage, it's an indirect relationship. You're incentivised to store as much of the weave as is possible so you have the recall block as often as possible, as recall blocks are required to mine a block. Today 10TB vs 20TB isn't going to make much of a difference as they're both much larger than the total weave size currently, however in 12 months time this might change and if you're not able to store any more blocks due to low disk space then you're less likely to have the recall blocks required, so less likely to be able to participate in mining, so less likely to make as much AR per day as a node with a larger disk.


[17-Jul-18 08:58 AM] Omeed - Blocktech Studios#2608
@Vilenarios @arthur thanks!


[17-Jul-18 11:40 AM] mickey#7342
Just wonder if number of cores influence the total hash rates, will it be using gpu more efficient than cpu since gpu consist of alot of cuda cores?

Hello everyone! How can I start mining this chain?


[17-Jul-18 08:23 PM] mickey#7342
Thanks kyle, btw current mining incentive is on the transaction fee and wallet creation? Or got include block reward?


[18-Jul-18 01:32 AM] codybartfast#9308
@Căpitanu   I believe you should email india@arweave.org from your preferred email address so she can add you to the mailing list and send you the mining guide.


[18-Jul-18 03:16 AM] Căpitanu#5971
thanks! Sent an e-mail... I also sent one last night to team@arweave.org, but have not received a reply


[18-Jul-18 03:23 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hi guys   

I'm just working through overnight emails now! Thanks for your patience.


[18-Jul-18 03:24 AM] Căpitanu#5971
no problem - I understand you guys must be swamped with work after the ICO


[18-Jul-18 03:24 AM] arweave-india#5075
True, true. We're expanding the team though at the moment, so that will help us to provide more intensive support to you guys, especially the dev and mining communities


[18-Jul-18 03:25 AM] Căpitanu#5971
Any way in which I can help with that?


[18-Jul-18 03:25 AM] Căpitanu#5971
I've got some 3-4 free hours during a day


[18-Jul-18 04:21 AM] arweave-india#5075
What a lovely offer! As you're here on Discord and you're about to get your mining setup arranged, it might be helpful to assist answering questions here if you're around :)

I have just replied to your email with the mining guide and have popped you on the mining mailing list also.


[18-Jul-18 04:21 AM] arweave-india#5075
Always good to have community members helping each other out! I am not a dev myself so I sometimes do have to pass questions on Discord to my colleagues unfortunately.


[18-Jul-18 04:22 AM] arweave-india#5075
But with our expanding dev team we will be able to have more of a dev presence here moving forwards  


[18-Jul-18 04:22 AM] arweave-india#5075
Sam is also in Korea at the moment, so our timezones are different than usual for question responses!


[18-Jul-18 04:24 AM] Căpitanu#5971
thanks! Your project is very promising for another project  I am currently involved in, so I'd love to get a headstart with you guys. I'll work on setting up my miner and hopefully gather the know-how needed to help other windows miners that might find it difficult.


[18-Jul-18 04:24 AM] Căpitanu#5971
Afaik mining is restricted to CPU atm - will this situation ever change?


[18-Jul-18 05:26 AM] arweave-india#5075
Ah that's interesting! We're always open to discussions re: new partnerships. 

Mining is not restricted to CPUs, you could use GPUs but CPUs are more efficient for our algorithm


[18-Jul-18 05:29 AM] Căpitanu#5971
we are looking to store the framework for a new type of processing unit on a distributed ledger and this blockchain has all the right properties. It's probably going to happen in about one year.
ATM we are looking to mine the chain in order to have the resources necessary for storing our data on-chain


[18-Jul-18 05:32 AM] arweave-india#5075
Ah, how interesting  


[18-Jul-18 05:32 AM] arweave-india#5075
Feel free to reach out directly in PMs or email if you have specific questions about your plans for using the system


[18-Jul-18 05:44 AM] Căpitanu#5971
will do! Thanks for the help, India!


[18-Jul-18 05:54 AM] Căpitanu#5971
I've got just one more question - will 100GB suffice for mining at this moment? I might extend my storage space in the future just to serve this purpose, but I suppose the chain is not that large at the moment


[18-Jul-18 06:17 AM] arweave-india#5075
Yes that's right the blockweave is currently under 100GB :)

However with the blockweave you don't have to store 100% of the weave to mine so even if you need to upgrade your storage space you wouldn't have to stop mining in the meantime


[18-Jul-18 06:48 AM] Căpitanu#5971
I'm not doing something right... I'll provide a .txt file with the info I get when trying to run the miner as instructed in the e-mail. 
If somebody could help, that would be awesome.

Please note I am using bash in windows to run arweave-server
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Iz9qG9xSz5bHaNOJ09LSDWsBQcVW5LUi


[18-Jul-18 06:58 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @Căpitanu , that looks correct I think, the startup stuff is logged to screen then you're just in an erlang terminal. If you open another terminal window and go to the same directory and run `make log`, that should show you a log stream of what's actually happening. You can also check out the logs in the logs directory


[18-Jul-18 06:59 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
You should see a bunch of much more detailed activity logging, something like this

@arweave-kyle thank you so much!


[18-Jul-18 07:18 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
No problem, let us know how you get on with that  


[18-Jul-18 09:20 AM] Căpitanu#5971
it's all set up and running. Very low CPU consumption, though
I was expecting it to solicit more from my computer


[18-Jul-18 10:42 AM] Căpitanu#5971
@others, how much CPU usage do you register?


[18-Jul-18 12:32 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Your CPU usage will be low until you have the recall block required to mine the next block in the system. As you progressively download more blocks from the network, your CPU usage overtime will increase.


[18-Jul-18 12:33 PM] arweave-sam#9630
If you decide to store all of the blocks, your CPU utilisation should eventually be at 100% of all bar one core.


[18-Jul-18 06:45 PM] NewbieFT#9201
is there any way to move the block data if I want to mine on another pc?


[18-Jul-18 06:49 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @NewbieFT , yeah after you’ve installed the node software on the new machine you can simply copy the tx and blocks directory across from the existing node


[18-Jul-18 06:49 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
Once you start the node it’ll figure out where it’s up to based on those directories


[18-Jul-18 06:51 PM] NewbieFT#9201
ok cool thanks @arweave-kyle


[18-Jul-18 06:51 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
Np  


[18-Jul-18 07:40 PM] Căpitanu#5971
@arweave-kyle Can I ask why mining this chain behaves in this manner? Other chains simply make hardware go from 1 to 100% in a few seconds, at most


[18-Jul-18 07:41 PM] Căpitanu#5971
and a noob question now... Where can I find my addres if I restart my rig?


[18-Jul-18 07:44 PM] arweave-sam#9630
This is because the Arweave uses Proof of Access mining, which is described in the lightpaper on the website.

There will be a wallets directory that you can find your old wallet in, if you did not specify an address on the command line.


[18-Jul-18 07:45 PM] Căpitanu#5971
Thank you, Sam!


[18-Jul-18 09:01 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Is there any command or log entry to see if I earned a transaction fee?

I've been mining since day one practically and I've almost earned 0.1 AR in TX fees 🤑

could you advise on what am I doing wrong?


[19-Jul-18 12:48 PM] Mike#2447
Open a second terminal and type  make log

[19-Jul-18 12:50 PM] Orig2g#7483
Should I get some reward for those blocks?


[19-Jul-18 12:50 PM] Orig2g#7483
My tokens are on Upwest


[19-Jul-18 12:50 PM] Orig2g#7483
And in chrome it shows 0 balance


[19-Jul-18 12:51 PM] Mike#2447
Block rewards are not currently active.  You may get some TX fees.


[19-Jul-18 12:51 PM] Orig2g#7483
So we are "setting up" for production in a way?)


[19-Jul-18 12:51 PM] Mike#2447
Like I posted above, I've been mining for about a month and I have almost 0.1 AR earned from TX fees.


[19-Jul-18 12:52 PM] Mike#2447
Last I heard, the dev team has estimated 2 months before block rewards begin.


[19-Jul-18 12:52 PM] Orig2g#7483
Anyway, thank you for your help, Mike!


[19-Jul-18 12:52 PM] Mike#2447
It's linked with a certain block height, but I haven't discovered what that block height is.


[19-Jul-18 12:53 PM] Orig2g#7483
I think that the instruction how to add additional HDD would be published later


[19-Jul-18 12:54 PM] Orig2g#7483
so I'll chill for now. have a great evening/day/morning!


[19-Jul-18 12:56 PM] Mike#2447
You too!

hey, what exact folder in the arweave directory need to be copied for a new pc, when i dont want to downloa dall again?


[19-Jul-18 01:50 PM] Marcin#0065
u said block and tx, but can u specify the folder names pls


[19-Jul-18 01:52 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
The folders are in the arweave directory, they're just `txs` and `blocks`

okay cool   thx


[19-Jul-18 01:52 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
No problem  


[19-Jul-18 01:52 PM] Marcin#0065
what does the invalid block folder mean? what blocks are inside it?


[19-Jul-18 01:53 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
If someone sends you a dud block, or if you fork and then move back to the main chain


[19-Jul-18 01:53 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
It'll kick those blocks to that directory


[19-Jul-18 01:54 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
So orphaned blocks mostly


[19-Jul-18 01:54 PM] Marcin#0065
i had some 4-5 pc freezes and crashed today, can it have to do with that? i didnt see that folder b4 that


[19-Jul-18 01:54 PM] Marcin#0065
i wasnt minign atm, just downloading blocks


[19-Jul-18 02:12 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We have been run 30 to 50 nodes for months now and haven't experienced any issues like that, @Marcin . Do you have any reason to believe it would be the miner?


[19-Jul-18 02:12 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I guess, perhaps, if you ran out of storage space that could be an issue?


[19-Jul-18 02:13 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Or if your machine was having thermal problems, but you say it wasn't actively mining?


[19-Jul-18 02:59 PM] Marcin#0065
oh sorry, the crashed were caused by me. i was freaking around with the pc while downloading blocks, i just was afraid i had screwed up and need ot download again everything.

Looks like there should be an accepted foreign block message with `5nNX_I5fhtFYvdpOhp6FJQfLtZXUlpKDm9FTPmuzneK4gBqTQlpUazG_ovDO-nIP` in there somewhere


[19-Jul-18 03:13 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
And your node is printing information about the block it received as it tried to validate it


[19-Jul-18 03:14 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
The fork recovery is fairly common, it should show a message after a couple of minutes saying it's complete


[19-Jul-18 03:25 PM] Marcin#0065
but no error due to my crappy bugged ubuntu? 
im going to run a fresh ubunto for arweave soon anyway


[19-Jul-18 04:49 PM] Cysop#4020
Has anyone done a write up on how to gauge mining performance?


[19-Jul-18 07:19 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Will it be more beneficial for me to keep my miner on now on prep for the production release? Or can I turn it off and wait for the sign to go?


[19-Jul-18 07:24 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@Cysop you can use the 'benchmark' command line arguments for getting a sense of your performance


[19-Jul-18 07:25 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@Vilenarios if you have your setup ready for the start of the rewards, you are good to go. I would recommend that you get up to date and turn it back on a few days before the rewards start, so you can download the new blocks in the network. We will send an email when the block approaches :).


[19-Jul-18 07:29 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Okay so the blocks I download now don’t really matter much after go live


[19-Jul-18 07:30 PM] Cysop#4020
@arweave-sam is there documentation somewhere listing the benchmark command?


[19-Jul-18 07:30 PM] arweave-sam#9630
No, they will still be used


[19-Jul-18 07:30 PM] arweave-sam#9630
So you will need to download them again if you delete them


[19-Jul-18 07:31 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@Cysop just running ./arweave-server will print the help, I believe

[19-Jul-18 09:04 PM] Amy#5900
@Căpitanu Are you ready to mine?@arweave-kyle how to set up arweave mining environment?


[19-Jul-18 11:50 PM] tiamat#9131
do we know an average daily traffic that a miner is currently doing?


[20-Jul-18 12:07 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The miners produce approximately 720 blocks peer day


[20-Jul-18 12:11 AM] mickey#7342
How many AR per block once block rewards kick start?


[20-Jul-18 12:15 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The yeild is calculated per block in a smooth curve, rather than in cliffs (like Bitcoin). I don't have the number for the first block to hand, I am afraid (my plane back from Korea Blockchain Week is just about to take off).


[20-Jul-18 12:18 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I can tell you though that 5.5mAR will be generated in the first year, 2.75mAR the year after that, then 1.375mAR etc


[20-Jul-18 12:20 AM] Marcin#0065

Thanks, Marcin!


[20-Jul-18 12:23 AM] Marcin#0065
Im amazed how fast it all went, and how far you came with your project. Not to start being sentimental, but its only being one year for a small team of your starting with archain, and today you have gathered thousands of people around you.


[20-Jul-18 12:23 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yes, it has been quite a ride. Thanks for coming along with us!


[20-Jul-18 12:24 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Where did you first find out about the project?


[20-Jul-18 12:24 AM] Marcin#0065
Its funny, it was one of the annoying pop up adds on cmc back then   


[20-Jul-18 12:24 AM] Marcin#0065
But after reading about archiving pages, i liked it instantly


[20-Jul-18 12:25 AM] Marcin#0065
And the logo was catchy ofc ;)


[20-Jul-18 12:25 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Interesting -- we only ran those for a day and we thought all the traffic we got was fake! (Super high bounce rate comparitively)


[20-Jul-18 12:26 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The boat logo?


[20-Jul-18 12:26 AM] Marcin#0065
Yep. The damn coop boat you have sent to the grave 😭


[20-Jul-18 12:26 AM] Marcin#0065
Cool


[20-Jul-18 12:26 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Haha


[20-Jul-18 12:26 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We still use it on GitHub as a subtle nod :p


[20-Jul-18 12:28 AM] Marcin#0065
Its like giving someone a useless job in your company coz hes your friend....i still miss it. I dont know your reasons, or what happend during the techstars days in berlin, but changing it to that triangle thing broke my heart   


[20-Jul-18 12:28 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Haha


[20-Jul-18 12:28 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I think we actually changed to the first triangle (still my avatar here) before Techstars


[20-Jul-18 12:29 AM] Căpitanu#5971
@Amy yes, I am. I haven't mined in the past 12h, but it's all set up


[20-Jul-18 12:29 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Then we made it a bit nicer when we changed the name


[20-Jul-18 12:30 AM] Marcin#0065
Its still fine tho. Since the main focus changed from page archiving to the dropbox like direction, the meaning of the boat may not be as strong as it was before maybe :) 
But tell me please the reason you came up with that idea of changing it?


[20-Jul-18 12:32 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The logo?


[20-Jul-18 12:32 AM] Marcin#0065
Yep


[20-Jul-18 12:33 AM] arweave-sam#9630
And we didn't move away from pages, btw, but we shifted towards a platform approach. I actually drafted up a few blog posts that I hope we will be releasing soon, that outline our approach to a decentralised web on the Arweave -- you might find them interesting.


[20-Jul-18 12:35 AM] arweave-sam#9630
If I recall correctly, the boat (we called it an arc) was drawn up by Will in 10 minutes in inkscape. Neither of us were ever particularly happy with it, so we shifted it in October, I think.

Since i remember you have a little background with neural networks. How can it be profitable, or is it already used?, in your project?


[20-Jul-18 12:38 AM] Marcin#0065
Any way or sense to use that for arweave?


[20-Jul-18 12:39 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We don't use ANNs in Arweave


[20-Jul-18 12:39 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We don't use ANNs in Arweave


[20-Jul-18 12:39 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We wondered for a while if we could add a simulator into the consensus mechanism


[20-Jul-18 12:39 AM] arweave-sam#9630
But ANNs don't really have the right properties


[20-Jul-18 12:40 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We have spoken about what would happen if you trained a convulutional neural network on the Arweave in, say, 10 years


[20-Jul-18 12:40 AM] arweave-sam#9630
But we didn't get far with the idea


[20-Jul-18 12:41 AM] arweave-sam#9630
On further studying the ANN-as-PoW thing, too, it seems very dangerous.


[20-Jul-18 12:42 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You don't really want to create decentralised economic incentives for humans to always run an AI.


[20-Jul-18 12:42 AM] arweave-sam#9630
If it reached a point of generalised intelligence, that could be disastrous.


[20-Jul-18 12:43 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You want these things to be easy to turn off, not for people to be selfishly motivated in a decentralised fashion to keep them on.


[20-Jul-18 12:43 AM] arweave-sam#9630
There is a good film in there somewhere  


[20-Jul-18 12:45 AM] Căpitanu#5971
There are people working on physical artificial synapses that can  be used for mining


[20-Jul-18 12:45 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yeah, for sure


[20-Jul-18 12:45 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Lots of people are working on it


[20-Jul-18 12:46 AM] Căpitanu#5971
the power consumption of those things is so low it doesn't make sense not to pursue this avenue


[20-Jul-18 12:47 AM] Căpitanu#5971
 


[20-Jul-18 12:47 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I fear the moral consequences might be broader for AI consensus mechanisms than the power usage


[20-Jul-18 12:48 AM] arweave-sam#9630
But perhaps I have been listening to too much Elon Musk :p


[20-Jul-18 12:51 AM] Căpitanu#5971
I look at it in the same way I look at a hammer. Yeah, sure, a hammer can crack a skull. It can also hit a nail - would you rather not have hammers lying around out of fear that they might crack skulls?
Jesus used hammers; bloke was a carpenter


[20-Jul-18 12:52 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Haha, nice analogy


[20-Jul-18 12:53 AM] Căpitanu#5971
I hope the thing will be so smart it needing us out of the picture won't even be considered.


[20-Jul-18 12:53 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I think that generalised AI might not be like a hammer though -- it would be more unpredictable, like living creatures are.


[20-Jul-18 12:53 AM] arweave-sam#9630
More like a running chainsaw than a hammer maybe


[20-Jul-18 12:54 AM] Căpitanu#5971
true that   oh well, hopefully Elon got it wrong


[20-Jul-18 12:54 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Haha


[20-Jul-18 12:55 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I guess we will all find out eventually  


[20-Jul-18 12:58 AM] Căpitanu#5971
I've got a question about your project. Are there any systems in place to avoid duplicate posting? Or do you consider the cost of writing on the chain is prohibitive enough for that to be avoided?


[20-Jul-18 12:59 AM] Căpitanu#5971
somebody spamming the chain is what I am getting at here


[20-Jul-18 12:59 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We don't have any, actually. If the user wants to pay to store the data, they can


[20-Jul-18 12:59 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Ah, yes, from a spam POV it is just a case of cost

[22-Jul-18 06:45 AM] codybartfast#9308
I’m having a problem mining using a port other than 1984.  The miner comes up ok, it writes blocks to disk ok, and joins the network, but it block_height doesn’t get updated and there isn’t any of the usual chatter like sending_external_block_to_bridge, validate_block, accepted_foreign_block.

I’m behind a NAT but I’ve double checked the port is accessible from the open net.

The problem is linked to the external address not the internal one.  19xx(ext) 
->19xx (int) and 19xx(ext)->1984(int) have the problem.   1984(ext)->19xx(int) and 1984(ext)->1984(int) both work normally.

I’m doing this because I’m trying to set up a second miner behind the NAT so there would be two miners on the same address with different ports.  However, the problem occurs even if there is only one miner using the non-1984 port (rebooted modem to get new public IP Address to verify).

(I’m not an Erlanger so this might be red herring, but it looks as though elli_request:peer is ignoring the port returned by inet:peername:

case elli__tcp:peername(Socket) of
        {ok, {Address, _}} ->
            list_to_binary(inet_parse:ntoa(Address));
        {error, _} ->
            undefined
    end;
)

[23-Jul-18 09:11 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @codybartfast that's for reporting, and just to double check this is still an issue and hasn't been resolved? Either way let me look into this and see what I can find, we'll need to verify and test some things on our end so might take a little while


[23-Jul-18 09:19 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @Marcin, there's a metrics endpoint (0.0.0.0/metrics) that exposes some stats about the miner which can be consumed by grafana etc, it's useful if you want to create a miner stats dashboard. There's a bug in the endpoint which causes this specific error to get printed, it's a known issue but it doesn't  affect anything (other than your logs!)

it compiles smoothly on my mac when i do git clone && git submodule init && git submodule update && docker build -t arweave . && docker run -p 1984:1984 arweave [peers] [wallet]


[23-Jul-18 09:48 AM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
you should mount a volume for the data whit -v and send the container to the background with -d option maybe.

I have setup a limit of 30 GB and after reaching this limit, it turned to "not_connected". Is this normal behaviour? Can't it just stay connected and continue to within the 30 limit?


[26-Jul-18 02:02 AM] codybartfast#9308
@Pacobits | stakely.io  There's some details how mining works in the Lightpaper on the main site https://www.arweave.org/, the hashing algorithm is SHA-384 which apparently is most efficiently done by CPU rather than GPUs.

@ruperttogrow Of course   Or just drop me an email at india@arweave.org from your preferred email address and I'll just reply with the mining guide


[26-Jul-18 06:34 AM] cavkie#9835
there is no reason to mine right now, because there are no rewards yet?


[26-Jul-18 07:40 AM] arweave-india#5075
@cavkie In short, you're correct. There are transaction rewards available but they total a very small amount. The main purpose of the soft onboarding stage is to get as wide a variety of miners able to prepare their systems in advance of block rewards commencing in under two months' time now.


[26-Jul-18 10:23 AM] Marcin#0065

wasnt ther ementioned its limite dto one core only?


[26-Jul-18 12:14 PM] Mike#2447
@Marcin The miner is supposed to use one less than your total number of cores.  I thought there was a flag to set the number of cores used, but I can't seem to find it now.


[26-Jul-18 02:03 PM] Marcin#0065

[28-Jul-18 02:30 AM] arthur#6010
Same for me, it uses all cores. I don't think it's bad, if there was a setting I would've changed it to use all cores anyway


[29-Jul-18 04:26 AM] tadaams#6474

Any suggestions are greatly appreciated


[29-Jul-18 06:17 AM] tiamat#9131
is keeping all the blocks mandatory? or we can start with a higher block?


[29-Jul-18 10:12 AM] aurora#3501
when you rune the mining command it automatically only fetches the latest blocks . how do you run the command so it fetches only recent blocks?


[29-Jul-18 10:13 AM] aurora#3501
if my archive is on a initial blocks i cant see it even if i am mining .


[29-Jul-18 01:06 PM] Marcin#0065
what is happening with block rewards during soft onboarding? are they parked somewhere?


[30-Jul-18 01:45 AM] tiamat#9131
is it established already the amount on mining rewards after inflation? right now they are very tiny


[30-Jul-18 01:53 AM] Joel#5880
Hi guys, so I got up and running with mining last night. However, after speaking with Sam, who told me that it will take a while to download the blocks before mining. It's been doing that since 10pm last night (10 hours), still not actually mining. Is that normal?


[30-Jul-18 02:47 AM] aurora#3501
no it roughly takes 15-30 minutes to download the latest blocks and start mining


[30-Jul-18 04:53 AM] arthur#6010
Took me 6 days to download all blocks. But the miner started after 1 or 2 days with the blocks it already had downloaded


[30-Jul-18 05:59 AM] Joel#5880
I don't get that? I thought we didn't need all the blocks, as @aurora says it took 15-30 minutes for them... I don't really want to run it for 6 days. Can you advise @arweave-sam? Thank you.


[30-Jul-18 09:54 AM] Mike#2447
In order to mine arweave, you need to possess the recall block that is randomly selected each round.  If you've only downloaded the last 50 blocks, then the chance of the next recall block being one of those 50 is slim and getting slimmer, as there are currently over 34,000 blocks.  The incentive to hold all the blocks is so that you will be able to actively mine every round.


[30-Jul-18 09:59 AM] Marcin#0065
I did run the mine command and it is downloading all blocks and mining as well. Its running few days all time and i think its around 20k blocks so far.


[30-Jul-18 10:00 AM] Marcin#0065
I didnt know you can use different commands to mine only or other commands to download all blocks as well.


[30-Jul-18 01:34 PM] Joel#5880
Ah I see... I'll just have to wait then 😜


[31-Jul-18 04:57 PM] fedetuk#2940
guys is it worth actually to start mining? think i would have to download all the blocks and then start


[01-Aug-18 10:18 AM] Marcin#0065
Its worth for the projekt ;) but you wont make any profit in soft onboarding phase. Afterwards, who knows... exchange in 2050 probably xD


[01-Aug-18 11:30 AM] Joel#5880
So I'm three days in, downloading blocks (9200 so far). I would like to move my saved blocks to a different drive and continue from there. Does anyone know the syntax before I start fiddling and reinvent the wheel? Thanks!


[01-Aug-18 11:58 AM] Marcin#0065
Just copy the arweave folder to the new drive and execute the arweave-server from there


[01-Aug-18 01:01 PM] Joel#5880
Does that mean I could copy someone else's Arweave folder and mine to my wallet?


[01-Aug-18 01:44 PM] Mike#2447
@Joel I don't see why that would pose a problem.  All the downloaded blocks should be identical between all users.


[01-Aug-18 01:47 PM] Joel#5880
Hmm... well that's shocked me. I thought there was a reason why I'm downloading such a small amount of data at such a slow rate. Can't, say, 32000 blocks be zipped up and hosted by Arweave on Azure or something?


[01-Aug-18 02:13 PM] Marcin#0065
Im asking myself the same question. At least an option to download all blocks instant should be given. But since the pc is running 24/7 anyway, i dont care. 
But at 1 mio blocks i cant imagine to download 2 years at that speed xD


[01-Aug-18 02:14 PM] Marcin#0065
Sometimes the speed of current block heigh is faster than rhe download of blocls xD


[01-Aug-18 02:18 PM] Joel#5880
Maybe I haven't read enough, but how would that scale in say 5 years? I assume the blockweave would consist of archived content + transactions? Potentially the blockweave could be petabytes?


[02-Aug-18 01:14 AM] codybartfast#9308
Irrc, the slow frequency of block download is intentional  at the moment and could be increased later.  Currently there are a relatively large number of new mines compared to the number of mines with a complete block history, if all the new mines downloaded at the maximum rate then it might create an heavy load for the established mines.   (So I guess that once the number of new mines is a smaller proportion of the total number of mines then it could be increased).


[02-Aug-18 02:39 AM] Joel#5880
Ahh cool, makes sense. Any idea why I just had this:

[02-Aug-18 06:49 AM] Marcin#0065
Why not providing one server with daily or weekly zipped blocks? Even if people pause mining a week, they got to download a long time again. My telephone internet dial modem was faster then this probably xD

@Joel That's a normal message and shows things are working well.  When a new block is being mined you need to a have the recall block (an older existing block selected  when the previous block was mined) if you have that existing block you'll get a "started_miner:" message (and CPU usage will be high), if you don't have the recall block you'll get that message and the CPU can cool down until the next block is mined.   Over time the you should see fewer of could_not_start_mining messages.

@Marcin I can't speak for the team, and I don't pretend to fully understand the principles behind arweave, but if were in their shoes I’d be looking for solutions that used the weave rather than creating a side channel.   I’m not sure to what extent the Wildfire protocol does, or will, play into this: “The higher the rank of a peer the faster a node will send it data in the future”.  It seems the easiest (though not the fastest) way to have a near complete block chain when mining rewards become available is to just leave the miner running, that helps build up the network.  Having said that, it is frustratingly slow - like watching Achilles and the tortoise.


[03-Aug-18 07:17 AM] Joel#5880
Only 14000 through. Also the advice of moving the Arweave folder to a different drive doesn't work :(. I'm running Linux subsystem for Windows, but would like to point Arweave miner to an alternative drive, so the blocks are stored elsewhere. Is there any way of doing this? Linux subsystem can only run on a Windows system drive, therefore I can't mine on my non-system drive.


[03-Aug-18 08:02 AM] Mike#2447
@Joel I am running in Linux virtual machines under VirtualBox with success.  You should also be able to mount different drives or folders using that method.


[03-Aug-18 01:08 PM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
when is that onboarding period for miners over? when do block rewards get paid?


[03-Aug-18 01:10 PM] codybartfast#9308
@Joel  I'm running it on WSL too, I can access regular drives under "/mnt".  E.g. "E:\arweave" can be reached under "/mnt/e/arweve".  I run everything from the external drive.


[03-Aug-18 01:20 PM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
wow i have one of only 27 nodes ^^


[03-Aug-18 01:21 PM] Joel#5880
Hmm... I moved the Arweave folder to my D drive, then loaded ubuntu and ran the mine syntax from mnt\d\arweave but didn't like it... is that what you did @codybartfast?


[03-Aug-18 01:41 PM] Joel#5880
So I just tried again, and this is what I get:


[03-Aug-18 01:41 PM] Joel#5880

[03-Aug-18 02:17 PM] Joel#5880
Solved it: This is what you need to do:

In Windows Explorer, first copy the 'prometheus_process_collector.so' file from "D:\arweave\lib\prometheus_process_collector\priv"
Then in Windows Explorer, delete the 'priv' file located at: "D:\arweave\lib\prometheus_process_collector_build\default\lib\prometheus_process_collector".
Now create a folder called 'priv' and paste the file that you copied earlier inside that folder.

You're welcome!


[03-Aug-18 02:17 PM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
i have some NodeERROR in my logs. i wonder if this is significant


[03-Aug-18 02:18 PM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
at the current speed it will take 8 days to complete downloading the blocks


[03-Aug-18 02:19 PM] Joel#5880
Mine's been going for 6 days   Still only at 15,000


[03-Aug-18 02:20 PM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
i have lots of blocks that are not accepted in the logs as well. something seems to be wrong with the weave ^^


[03-Aug-18 02:21 PM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
@Joel thanks for the indication


[03-Aug-18 02:21 PM] Joel#5880
Try a different node maybe?...


[03-Aug-18 02:22 PM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
@Joel what do you mean by trying a different node? the peers in the command line on startup?


[03-Aug-18 02:22 PM] Joel#5880
yeah, that :p


[03-Aug-18 02:23 PM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
i copied all peers from indias email. not a good idea?


[03-Aug-18 02:24 PM] Joel#5880
I only used one:

./arweave-server \peer 54.175.114.204 \mine mining_addr XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX


[03-Aug-18 02:33 PM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
do you still get connections to 23 peers?


[03-Aug-18 02:34 PM] Joel#5880
I'm not sure - I'm currently mining though which is a coincidence, as before I fixed the above issue, I was only downloading blocks


[03-Aug-18 02:34 PM] Joel#5880
How do I know how many peers I'm connected to?


[03-Aug-18 02:34 PM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
from the logs i think

oh! mine is mining!  


[03-Aug-18 02:38 PM] Joel#5880
But I'm wondering now lol... Maybe I should be connected to all of those peers in the email


[03-Aug-18 02:38 PM] Joel#5880
I getting one of those blocks every 25 seconds, are you getting more haha


[03-Aug-18 02:38 PM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
maybe

new blocks maybe

my best guess is that someone implemented the hashing function in a more effective way on a gpu maybe


[03-Aug-18 03:38 PM] Joel#5880
I'm only using laptop i7  


[03-Aug-18 03:41 PM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
since everyone has all the blocks on harddrive especially in the beginning the hashing speed will decide over how many blocks everyone mines. later the available harddrive capacity becomes a factor when the weave grows too big. but until then: hashing power. and the current implementation just uses the default crypto library provided by erlang with no optimisations whatsoever. unfair game if you ask me


[03-Aug-18 03:41 PM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271

Ahh I see!, g'night bud!


[03-Aug-18 03:46 PM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
fun fact: when mining pools arrive they will have to provide harddrive space and host the weave. to stay competitive, every mining pool has to have a complete copy. the nice sharding architecture is obsolete then. PoW is bad, I think.

Hey there, I would like to run a Arweave Node, what hardware does the node benefit from?


[04-Aug-18 12:44 AM] codybartfast#9308
@S A L M O N  the recommended way to start mining is email India Raybould at india@arweave.org (from your preferred email) and she'll add you to the list & send the mining guide to you.  I think they're doing it like this so they have a way to contact miners when updates are needed.


[04-Aug-18 12:49 AM] codybartfast#9308
@Joel  A little late, but I don't remember if I moved it to the external drive or installed it there, but I do have a symbolic link from my home directory from memory the command is something like "ln -s /mnt/e/arweave ~/areave"


[04-Aug-18 01:00 AM] codybartfast#9308
I _think_ there are two ways the mine gets new blocks.  While it's running you should always receive newly mined blocks as they're sent out for verification and the recall block get's distributed with it.  The  writing_block_to_disk blocks are then needed to fill in the gaps before the mine was started.


[04-Aug-18 01:07 AM] S A L M O N#5069
@codybartfast thanks for your reply. i did email india, but she did not send me the tutorial


[04-Aug-18 01:08 AM] codybartfast#9308
I mine a few blocks a day, but I'm expecting that to drop to near zero once there is real money at stake and 'serious' miners get involved     I have a console open and leave "make log | grep reward_address" running to see who's winning and yes, it's > 90% to the same address.   If you mine a block it's easy to spot because the log will show your address in base64 (e.g.  bPzNKfH0NVkJVahBQ8O2ugqaZW7-DOpt1JxrDFHD-7c) instead of numeric digits.


[04-Aug-18 02:21 AM] S A L M O N#5069
Is there a way I can run a Node when my hardware is basically Internet Bandwidth and Storage?  I don't have a good CPU or GPU


[04-Aug-18 03:22 AM] codybartfast#9308
Hi @S A L M O N  it should work with low CPU but the chances of mining new blocks seems very roughly to be the product of the how much of the block you store and the amount of CPU  (apparently GPU isn't relevant),   I.e. half the cpu power would half the chances.  Currently bandwidth demands seem low.


[04-Aug-18 03:35 AM] codybartfast#9308
@Joel  - I've been wondering why you had a problem after moving stuff.  One thing I tend to do is only use Linux commands to touch files that Linux is going to use.  e.g. I try to use mv, cp and vi instead of using dos/ps commands or Explorer.


[04-Aug-18 03:38 AM] Joel#5880
Because Windows saw the Priv directory as a file and not a folder, so I just created a folder with the name 'priv'. I'm not exactly sure why this worked, but I received the error that ...\priv... is not a directory... then placed the *.so file inside


[04-Aug-18 03:39 AM] Joel#5880
Ah no, I didn't have a problem after moving stuff... only before


[04-Aug-18 08:49 AM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
@codybartfast oh i think i mined 1 block. thanks for the hint with the base64 format


[04-Aug-18 08:49 AM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
and good to know that it works


[04-Aug-18 08:49 AM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
but i got no reward on my wallet


[04-Aug-18 01:19 PM] tiamat#9131
what is more important, to have more cores/threads or few and very fast?


[04-Aug-18 02:04 PM] tiamat#9131
also can we create/join pools?


[05-Aug-18 05:49 AM] codybartfast#9308
@Goldberg | StakeSquid  There aren't any mining rewards at the moment they're due to start in "about two months" (iirc).  I think it's triggered by the block height.  Occasionally there are some transaction fees but they're very small even when there are any.  The verifying_finder_reward message is currently showing the (transaction?) reward pool is zero.  Even when there is something in the pool I think you need to divide by 10^12 to  convert to AR.


[05-Aug-18 05:58 AM] codybartfast#9308
@tiamat  Personally I don't know, there is benchmark option " ./arweave-server benchmark" but it only tests the performance on a single core but I expect the  per core performance is lower when all/most cores are in use.   Not aware of any pools.


[05-Aug-18 06:01 AM] Joel#5880
Hmm... is there any point in being an individual miner in the project? Realistically?  In a few months, when rewards are given, how much AR is rewarded per block? Me mining for 2 months and getting one block, which gives me 25 AR, doesn't equate...


[05-Aug-18 06:06 AM] Joel#5880
When I say individual, I mean someone with just a standard setup, decent CPU, 4Tb storage


[05-Aug-18 06:10 AM] tiamat#9131
if we run more than 1 miner, do they compete? if yes, then pools are necessary


[05-Aug-18 06:13 AM] codybartfast#9308
I happen to have an under used PC and a spare disk so the marginal cost of mining is very low, and of course it depends on how much those 25 AR are worth (or might be wort in the future).  Or that's 31,000 pages I can archive.   But apart from the slim chance of 'real' financial reward I'm mining mainly because I find it an interesting project.


[05-Aug-18 06:14 AM] Joel#5880
Fair enough  

[05-Aug-18 06:18 AM] codybartfast#9308
@tiamat  That's beyond my limited knowledge/understanding.  I presume pools make an effort to make sure they're not duplicating work?


[05-Aug-18 06:26 AM] Joel#5880
@codybartfast can I ask whether you used all of the peers that were sent in the email? Or just two?


[05-Aug-18 06:26 AM] tiamat#9131
@codybartfast  Generally yes, but I've heard Sam explaining that on Arweave miners work together instead of against each other.


[05-Aug-18 06:27 AM] tiamat#9131
It does not matter about peers, you should use more in case some are down, but even if you use only 1, it will get more peers from it


[05-Aug-18 06:27 AM] Joel#5880
Ahh ok, thanks


[05-Aug-18 06:34 AM] tiamat#9131
Is there a fix block/date for rewards? "2 months" were like a month ago  


[05-Aug-18 06:41 AM] codybartfast#9308
I thought I saw something semi-official estimating it as 2 months about a week ago, and I've vague recollection of it being block based, but that could  all be figments of my imagination. Mañana!

[06-Aug-18 12:42 PM] tadaams#6474
If I start syncing the blocks,  will I be able to mine in approx 10 days ?


[06-Aug-18 01:15 PM] Mike#2447
If you're lucky you might start mining right away.  It just depends if you have the correct recall block downloaded.


[06-Aug-18 03:00 PM] tadaams#6474
I see okay


[07-Aug-18 12:19 AM] codybartfast#9308
Is it just me, or is the weave in a funny state at the moment.  Last night I saw my the value in my mining wallet popping up and down,  and now there seems to be a lack of consensus on the block height.  Currently it seems to bouncing between 39,3xx and 39,4xx.  When I query http://159.65.213.43/info it also is returning different values in consecutive responses (e.g. 39,481 then 39,354).


[07-Aug-18 01:46 AM] Joel#5880
Is there a way to determine the current recall block?


[07-Aug-18 07:04 AM] codybartfast#9308
From the light paper:  "The ‘recall block’
to incorporate into the next block is chosen
by taking the hash of the current block and
calculating its modulus with respect to the
current block height.".


[07-Aug-18 01:05 PM] codybartfast#9308
24 hrs later and the balance in my wallet (per chrome extension) is bouncing between two different values still.    In the space of a couple of minutes the extension has also told me the the Block Era is:
39678
0

I have also observed the Chrome extension reporting erroneous block eras.


[07-Aug-18 03:36 PM] Joel#5880
I've finally started mining. Also I am receiving rewards, albeit very small .0000010950


[07-Aug-18 03:37 PM] Joel#5880
actually .000000010950


[07-Aug-18 03:38 PM] Joel#5880
Does anyone know what the actual reward for a block will be when the soft onboarding ends?


[07-Aug-18 04:23 PM] tierralibre#2740
So far, is  totally not profitable. I have been running a server for 1.5 months. Server cost 24 Euros per month.


[07-Aug-18 04:23 PM] tierralibre#2740
Rewards less than 1 AR


[07-Aug-18 04:23 PM] tierralibre#2740
which is what potentially 0.5 Euros


[07-Aug-18 04:24 PM] tierralibre#2740
we don't even know actually.


[07-Aug-18 04:24 PM] tierralibre#2740
and when people start getting onboard and really mining.


[07-Aug-18 04:24 PM] tierralibre#2740
I mean, how much will the storage cost on arweave, when the distributed cost is so high.


[07-Aug-18 04:25 PM] tierralibre#2740
I really like the technology, the idea and the team is doing a great job. But to me still is not clear, the benefit for the miners.


[07-Aug-18 04:26 PM] tierralibre#2740
I guess if it gets really big the weave. Then other things apply. And this is what the team knows. And they are looking beyond the start and present.


[07-Aug-18 04:35 PM] tierralibre#2740
and we still have to see what happens with the economics of arweave. I mean when it gets listed what is its actual value. Is it speculative, or is it an utility token. And as utility token, how much people are ready to pay for storage.


[08-Aug-18 12:53 AM] codybartfast#9308
This morning the network seems very sick.  The (presumed) arweave machines that support the chrome extension at 159.65.213.43 have been showing a height/era of  39908 for half an hour but occasionally returns  a completely different height, and only 10 out of 52 public peers are returning a non-zero block height and those 10 are returning different heights.

My node which has been completely forked for >24hrs now can't join the network:
    =INFO REPORT==== 8-Aug-2018::06:51:29 ===
        node_not_joining
       reason: cannot_get_full_block_from_peer
       received_instead: unavailable


[08-Aug-18 01:01 AM] tiamat#9131
yes, there seems to be very little consensus


[08-Aug-18 01:08 AM] tiamat#9131
my guess is some nodes are too fast compared to others and the block heights are so different that they just can't sync back


[08-Aug-18 01:08 AM] tiamat#9131
lets say you start a new node now, the answers are so different about a certain block that it just cannot tell who is right


[08-Aug-18 01:15 AM] codybartfast#9308
My guess has been that it might be something to do with there being multiple machine behind the 159...43 address.  If they can see each other and the public address, but we just see public addresses then I wondered if that affects the consensus.  E.g. publicly those machines might have just one vote because they're sharing the same IP, but internally they might have individual votes and in rare circumstances that's enough to stop consensus - but that's complete random speculation  and I don't want to pretend I know what I'm talking about.


[08-Aug-18 06:51 AM] Mike#2447
@arweave-sam  @arweave-kyle  Can you guys weigh in on this discussion?


[08-Aug-18 07:10 AM] tiamat#9131
I see some consensus now, but many peers are down

[09-Aug-18 06:39 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @codybartfast, @Mike yeah you're correct about the 159 extension IP address, it's a load balancer which routes requests to multiple nodes. The nodes themselves do also have external IP addresses which they use for mining and inter-node comms, the 159 IP address is just for the benefit of the web extension so it has one point to talk to.

Yes there were quite a few forks yesterday but they seem to have been resolved now, you're correct that this will have been the cause of fluctuations in block era and wallet balances as different nodes behind the load balancer will not have necessarily agreed in real time on the state of a transaction, wallet, etc


[09-Aug-18 06:41 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
But yes this all seems to be stable today    There were some small adjustments pushed to Github which changed some timeout values which seems to have helped a bit, you can try and pull that from master but it's not at all required/urgent. The node dev team are currently working on a bunch of stability improvements as we speak  


[09-Aug-18 07:02 AM] Mike#2447
Good to hear Kyle.  Thanks for the update!


[09-Aug-18 07:02 AM] Mike#2447

[10-Aug-18 01:00 AM] codybartfast#9308
Thanks for the update Kyle, all's well that ends well.  And the unified network decided on the higher of the two values my wallet was showing so I'm 0.005 AR better off   


[10-Aug-18 01:01 AM] codybartfast#9308
I don't suppose you'll be open sourcing the block explorer code?

[11-Aug-18 05:02 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hi @Goldberg | StakeSquid -- yes please. We pushed some changes that might have caused your node to drop out of sync temporarily


[11-Aug-18 05:02 AM] arweave-sam#9630
A simple git pull and re-join should get you back in the net


[11-Aug-18 06:30 AM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
@arweave-sam done. let's see


[12-Aug-18 10:32 AM] codybartfast#9308
@arweave-sam  I see similar errors but I don't think a "simple pull" is making a difference because  git  has a detached head at 'stable'.  (presumably from the install command: "git -c advice.detachedHead=false checkout stable").


[12-Aug-18 10:36 AM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
@codybartfast right i ignored that and did git checkout master && git pull


[12-Aug-18 10:59 AM] codybartfast#9308
Thanks @Goldberg | StakeSquid, yes that makes sense.


[14-Aug-18 09:44 AM] codybartfast#9308

Hi Scott!


[18-Aug-18 09:23 AM] Dimilian#3620
hi guys . got a question   


[18-Aug-18 09:26 AM] Dimilian#3620
I install 1 miner and steal downloading the blocks 8000 up to now   .  Is it possible to  copy this block and transferred in to my second miner ? And how ?


[18-Aug-18 10:26 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @Dimilian, yup and it’s easy! If you check out the directory you installed the miner to,!you should see two directories, blocks and txs, they’re full of json files with all the blocks and transactions. If you just copy the contents of those directories over to your new miner and start it up you should be good to go  


[18-Aug-18 10:56 AM] Dimilian#3620
Thank you arweave-kyle#4569


[19-Aug-18 01:46 AM] Marcin#0065
running th eminer 3 weeks 24/7, still not all block loaded. 
why its so slow?


[19-Aug-18 04:58 AM] tiamat#9131
What bw do you have? In 1 week I have 2/3 of blocks, probably in the next 3-4 days 100%.


[19-Aug-18 08:28 AM] Joel#5880
Mine is exactly the same... three weeks today and only at 36,000 blocks... what's "bw"?


[19-Aug-18 09:10 AM] Marcin#0065
bandwith is strait 50mbits


[19-Aug-18 09:11 AM] Marcin#0065
i had 2/3 in the first week too, but since then almost not progress, the current block height goes almost in same speed with new blocks written


[19-Aug-18 05:06 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Do we have a date when arweave miming is live?


[20-Aug-18 09:20 AM] Joel#5880
Anyone willing to host the blocks up to 42,000, we can then merge with what we're already downloaded...  


[20-Aug-18 11:05 AM] Marcin#0065
Its sad that the community has to come up with such ideas. I dont get why the arweave team doesnt react to it. Running a system for weeks to not even be up to date just sucks and will surely not encourage others to join


[20-Aug-18 11:22 AM] tiamat#9131
you can still mine even if you don't have all blocks


[20-Aug-18 12:06 PM] Joel#5880
Mine for nothing though...?


[20-Aug-18 12:08 PM] Joel#5880
Yeah ok... "for the community"... reward should be given even if it's smaller than the future full amount.


[20-Aug-18 12:26 PM] tiamat#9131
rewards are given now for transactions only so if you mine a block you may get something if there were transactions in it


[20-Aug-18 04:20 PM] Marcin#0065
If you have 75% of blocks, you can mine only 75% of the time the pc is running. The other 25% is waste of resources.
A huge part in my mind. And an eass solition could be given, whis is not. I truly dont get it


[24-Aug-18 10:49 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hi @Marcin we will be releasing a major implementation upgrade in the coming weeks that will significantly reduce the size of the download (and storage on disk) required in order to join the weave. This is why we are not offering archives of the blocks at this time.


[25-Aug-18 03:17 AM] tiamat#9131
@Joel after 1 month of mining I have around 0.6 AR balance, I will just shut them off, there is no point to keep going like this


[25-Aug-18 06:03 AM] Joel#5880
I know a way to just download the blocks without ever mining, until you have all blocks... if that helps?

what is this?


[27-Aug-18 06:59 AM] codybartfast#9308
Hi @Marcin,  my assumption is that this is the transaction fee pool.  Whenever somebody pays to put data on the Weave (or perhaps transfers AR) then the AR transaction fee gets added to reward pool and a fraction(?) of that pool is awarded to successful miners of new blocks.   The values are not as big as they seem, I think they're  in pico-AR (ie.  10 ^ -12).   If they're aren't many transactions then the pool gets emptied quite quickly, hence the 0 values.


[27-Aug-18 02:20 PM] oca_rhodes#7469
@Joel What is your technique for downloading the blocks more quickly?


[27-Aug-18 03:11 PM] Joel#5880
Not necesarily faster, just download blocks without mining...


[27-Aug-18 03:16 PM] oca_rhodes#7469
How?


[28-Aug-18 12:43 AM] Marcin#0065
till when soft onboarding phase is running?


[28-Aug-18 01:23 AM] tiamat#9131
the soft onboarding does not make much sense, why would miners join if there is no incentive ?


[28-Aug-18 07:34 AM] Marcin#0065
:)
A bit true. But its suppose to be over soon.
Otherwise more and more miners will leave


[28-Aug-18 04:24 PM] Unit#8533
it's probably to make sure the system is working properly


[28-Aug-18 05:52 PM] Vilenarios#8742

[29-Aug-18 03:33 PM] Joel#5880
Not sure if anyone is in the same position as me... I'm at 40,000 and now it's doing about 200 a day, at this rate I'll never catch up... I've been monitoring the folder where the blocks are stored and have noticed something strange while simultaneously monitoring the log... I'm downloading blocks which are appearing in the folder, however, the number of files in the folder are not increasing at the rate of the log... it's as if new ones are being added but older ones are being pushed out... can anyone explain this, or confirm if this is happening to someone else also?


[30-Aug-18 04:37 AM] arthur#6010
I've earned some AR by mining in the beginning but last 2 weeks nothing, what could be the issue?


[30-Aug-18 04:41 AM] arthur#6010
I'm at block 46299 and it's using 100GB of storage, but there's no reward


[30-Aug-18 04:43 AM] codybartfast#9308
@Joel, I can't answer all your questions, but my experience is that I get all the blocks that are mined (by anybody) while I'm running the mine.   E.g. if you start mining on August 1st then you should have every block that's since that date.  The older blocks that are downloaded  are then only needed to fill the gaps before that date.  Also the downloaded blocks  seem pretty random - they're often ones that I have already.  So if I download 200 blocks a lot of those are duplicates.


[30-Aug-18 04:47 AM] codybartfast#9308
@arthur a lot of us updated our mining software version a few weeks back (see discussion above 11th August) when there were a  lot of forking problems.  If you haven't already you might try "git checkout master && git pull".


[30-Aug-18 04:49 AM] rehash#3438
@arthur I feel you, I like the project but without rewards I had to move miners towards other coins,  @arweave-kyle  or @arweave-sam  should give us more details about rewards


[30-Aug-18 04:50 AM] arthur#6010
@codybartfast  I'll try it out. Why wasn't this posted on the miner mailing list?


[30-Aug-18 04:51 AM] codybartfast#9308
@arthur  Good luck, and yes, good question.


[30-Aug-18 06:22 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @Joel, we’re aware of (and fixing) an issue where the backfilling of blocks will sometimes log that it’s requesting a block that’s already held on disk, so you might see a log message but as the block is already on disk you don’t see the directory file count change


[30-Aug-18 06:26 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
There’s also an update coming soon that cuts the block size down by about 90%, so this process should be a lot faster when that’s out


[30-Aug-18 06:27 AM] tiamat#9131
but why no rewards? we the early testers end up wasting resources for nothing


[30-Aug-18 06:28 AM] thegoat19#8424
i have a 140 TB i can toss at the network  


[30-Aug-18 06:34 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
@tiamat we told everyone upfront there would be a soft on boarding period where mining rewards would not be enabled, as our system is different from other cryptos we wanted to give people time to setup and test.


[30-Aug-18 06:36 AM] tiamat#9131
yeah, but it's near 3 months already


[30-Aug-18 06:37 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Yeah we told everyone it would be about 3 months at the time


[30-Aug-18 06:37 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
It’s based on block height so it’ll drift a bit, but they will come online over the next few weeks

140 TB give or take


[30-Aug-18 02:59 PM] Joel#5880
@tiamat I think it's probably because of what Kyle said about a known issue at the moment with duplicate block requests...


[31-Aug-18 01:33 AM] Marcin#0065
As from a subjective feeling, but the teetnetworks did work way better :/


[31-Aug-18 01:34 AM] Marcin#0065
As speaking from download speed of blocks


[31-Aug-18 03:38 AM] Lasse Clausen#6198
@tiamat  probably  just came back to it when rewards are on


[31-Aug-18 03:38 AM] Lasse Clausen#6198
i do like that they're being deliberate and testing things out step by step


[31-Aug-18 05:05 AM] codybartfast#9308
@tiamat , I'm just trying to understand this stuff as I go along , but I _think_  changes in mining rate are normal, as more miners join the network the mining time will get shorter but that will eventually result in the difficulty doubling and the speed being halved.


[31-Aug-18 05:43 AM] tiamat#9131
I still believe early testers should get some rewards, I think  later more miners with strong hardware will join and we might not get anything.


[01-Sep-18 10:30 AM] Lasse Clausen#6198
there's usually enough people who are mainly interested in the technology to test without money rewards at the beginning


[04-Sep-18 05:19 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Did Arweave announce block height of when the soft onboarding ends?


[05-Sep-18 12:16 AM] rehash#3438
For me this "soft" thing is taking too long, I already moved my machines to another project.


[05-Sep-18 04:16 AM] arweave-india#5075
@Vilenarios I have just confirmed for you guys that the specific block height is 65700. As you know I'm not a developer myself, but I understand that from now it will take another few weeks to reach that block height, from the original estimate. I understand that the soft onboarding will still be triggered by the same block height, and this will realistically be reached only after the significant upcoming network 1.5 release.


[05-Sep-18 04:18 AM] arweave-india#5075
We will ensure to give several days' warning to everyone on our mining mailing list ahead of the appropriate block height which will trigger the end of soft onboarding.


[05-Sep-18 04:26 AM] arweave-india#5075
@rehash That's no problem - if you're signed up to our mining mailing list, you'll get an email several days before the soft onboarding stage ends (and block rewards commence) so you have time to get your setup back online, if you so desire.

We anticipated that most people during the soft onboarding stage would establish and tweak their setup, shutting it down until block rewards began, so that's super reasonable.


[05-Sep-18 04:27 AM] arweave-india#5075
I just posted an update in the 'announcements' channel on this server, but just in case people didn't see it, here is the part relating to mining:

- Arweave version 1.5 is nearing release. This version builds considerably on the initial main network release, changing approximately 20% of the codebase and delivering faster data access and a more streamlined and reliable mining experience. This has been the focus on our dev team’s work for a while now, so we’re really excited to get this shipped soon.


[05-Sep-18 09:56 AM] Vilenarios#8742
@arweave-india  thank you for this update!


[05-Sep-18 09:57 AM] Vilenarios#8742
@Marcin  block height is 65700 for soft onboarding completion.

{Reactions}
  

[05-Sep-18 12:58 PM] tiamat#9131
@arweave-india  I don't know how have you calculated but there are approx. 16425 blocks to got until that and we are currently doing only 300 blocks/ day, it will take another 54 days, and if more miners are leaving it will take more


[05-Sep-18 01:08 PM] Mike#2447
It's possible the coming update will change the block time.  We'll have to wait and see.

ETA for the update?


[05-Sep-18 01:59 PM] Mike#2447
No ETA given.
"Arweave version 1.5 is nearing release."
If you check the GitHub, you'll see several developers are making regular updates to the code.


[06-Sep-18 12:34 AM] Marcin#0065
Can someone put in the command to update via git im terminal instead of manually download and replace files?


[06-Sep-18 04:34 AM] arweave-india#5075
@tiamat As @Mike rightly suggested, the upcoming 1.5 release will change the block time, so we're not looking at about 54 days, but realistically more like about 4 weeks after first estimated (so about 4 weeks from now)


[06-Sep-18 04:36 AM] arweave-india#5075
@Marcin  Thanks!


[09-Sep-18 11:23 AM] Joel#5880
So I'm trying a "git checkout master && git pull" but receive an error about Canary.md and src/ar_node.erl needing changes committed... I've tried "git stash -u" to no avail. Any ideas? Thanks in advance!


[10-Sep-18 06:53 AM] codybartfast#9308
Hi @Joel ,   to me that suggests  those two files have been modified locally at some point, assuming you don't want to keep those changes you can reset those files individually with the command "git checkout -- Canary.md  src/ar_mode.erl"  which should reset just those files.  Once they're reset the original command should work.


[10-Sep-18 06:57 AM] Joel#5880
Thank you!


[11-Sep-18 12:54 AM] Marcin#0065
Even i have all blocks on the disk, by restarting the miner its downloading an rewriting 50 blocks. Does it suppose to work that way?


[11-Sep-18 12:56 AM] cryptoscout#3419
Where do we get the miner from?


[11-Sep-18 01:08 AM] codybartfast#9308
I always get the 50 blocks too.   Apart from filling in any gap while a server was down I wonder if it is also helps recover from forks by making the miner start from a common position.   Probably one of those things that could be optimized  significantly but is good enough for now.


[11-Sep-18 01:18 AM] codybartfast#9308
@cryptoscout I think the official way is still to send an email to india@arweave.org and she'll send you the mining guide and add you to the miners mailing list.


[14-Sep-18 02:54 PM] codybartfast#9308
Just in case anybody's interested, I wrote some crude code to discover peers and find the ones that agree on a common height and current hash,  it may not be be very accurate but here's what it says at the moment:

[18-Sep-18 07:05 AM] tiamat#9131
yeah, maybe they have to do with the 1.5 version?


[18-Sep-18 07:52 AM] arweave-sam#9630
That second error looks like somebody asking for a TX from you from a Javascript application, but they have malformed their object to object name conversion.


[18-Sep-18 07:52 AM] arweave-sam#9630
There might be other languages that use that `[object Object]` default printing format, but JS is the one that comes to mind


[18-Sep-18 07:55 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The first message, you rightly observed @tiamat, is a block being propagated by a new 1.5 node.

Yep, in the future we will make a special 'mining summary' log that filters stuff like this.

Wtf? Since today, everytime i run the mining command ubuntu shows a black screen. But active black screen, monitor is receiving signals. 
Besides all working fine, the very moment i run the command, flickering and black screen. wtf? Anyone else? I speculate a defect in internal gpu, but ive been running mining for months and never had problems, and igpu workin fine if not running mining.

Hi Marcin, we haven't experienced any issues of that kind on our machines (we have been running about 40 nodes on Arweave's  test nets then main net for nearly a year now). If you get any more info please can you send it to me?


[19-Sep-18 06:59 AM] Marcin#0065
Yeah, i see the bug on my side too. Ive been running testnet with you too for a very long time. I guess the cpu is going to die slowly now :D has been heating my room for enough time now. :D


[19-Sep-18 07:04 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Do you guys think SSD even benefits the blockweave performance?


[19-Sep-18 07:05 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I would think the network would bottleneck enough to render SSDs not worthwhile


[19-Sep-18 07:20 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Would cheap large 7200 rpm drives be the best?


[20-Sep-18 01:04 AM] codybartfast#9308
@Vilenarios  Just guessing... I would think the first priority for mining performance is having access to as much of the data of possible, if there were a choice between all the data a x1 speed vs half the data at x2 speed I'm pretty sure the first option is best.   Doubling the number of cores looks like it would also be far more beneficial than increasing disk speed.   However, the complicating factor is how the Wildfire protocol will work.  (iirc) it will reward responsive peers and so by inference would punish slow ones, but I doubt SSD is likely to be worth the cost (guess).  I still want one though!


[20-Sep-18 05:34 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Thanks for your thoughts Cody.


[20-Sep-18 05:35 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Good point on cpu being number one followed by network.

Yep, you would need an extremely fast network connection before SDDs would be preferable to HDDs. Optimising for size of disk should be safe for now.


[24-Sep-18 06:39 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We have just tagged the first BETA release of Arweave 1.5! We will be sending out the wider announcement in the next few days, but I figured our community here might appreciate a ‘sneak peek’.

If you want to try it out, please first duplicate your Arweave directory (including the blocks), then run the following command in the new Arweave directory:

`git fetch; git checkout N.1.5.0.0-BETA-1; git pull;`

Please send error reports to myself or @themue, who will get GitHub issues setup.

Thanks!

@excelix Thanks! No, the N.1.5 release (including test release) is independent from when the block rewards begin

New block format is between 500 and 1000 bytes on disk  


[24-Sep-18 08:20 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Wallet lists and block hash lists are now shared between blocks, so the storage efficiency has been dramatically improved.


[24-Sep-18 12:04 PM] Marcin#0065
Is there a "power off" trigger in the blockweave? In case it will be used in a bad way? I know that topic was asked many times. But what i mean is more a worst case scenario, misused, virus spreading or whatever reason which demands to shut it, or pause at least, off.
?


[24-Sep-18 12:06 PM] Marcin#0065
It would be a dream for a hacker to simply infect the weave and having millions of people using and downloading data from it. Dropbox etx have control and all centralized. But the weave? Who is in charge if shit is going on pretty badly?


[24-Sep-18 12:29 PM] tiamat#9131
I guess the same applies for eth, only it would be more expensive, you can store data there and then download from nodes


[25-Sep-18 02:28 AM] codybartfast#9308
@arweave-sam  From the Department of Trivial Comments:  I don't think the `git pull` above will work because N.1.5.0.0-BETA-1 is a tag not a branch. 

On the other hand the code seems to be working just fine, so thank you to you to the team from both me and my disk.  Won't "need" that 100TB SSD quite so soon.


[25-Sep-18 05:08 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hey @Marcin there is no kill switch, per se, it is up to the miners to decide which content they store and serve, however. Adding a malware database to a node's blacklist would alleviate this issue.


[25-Sep-18 04:13 PM] Vilenarios#8742
So will just rerunning the miner update itself?


[25-Sep-18 04:14 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Such awesome news to hear 1.5 is ready!!!


[26-Sep-18 12:36 AM] codybartfast#9308
Hi @Vilenarios,  to get the update you'll need to manually fetch/checkout the code.  After stopping the miner use 

```git fetch 
git checkout N.1.5.0.0-BETA-1```

and restart.


[26-Sep-18 12:49 AM] Marcin#0065
Restart with the same ip adresses?


[26-Sep-18 01:19 AM] tiamat#9131
yes


[26-Sep-18 01:47 AM] Joel#5880
So the blocks that I've previously downloaded are still valid I assume. How is there such a huge difference in size?


[26-Sep-18 01:51 AM] Joel#5880
From @arweave-sam : "Wallet lists and block hash lists are now shared between blocks". So most of the data in the initial version was wallet and hash data, leaving up to 1kb for actual archive data?


[26-Sep-18 02:42 AM] Tommyj#8820

How can I mine with 1.5.0-BETA?
also use git clone https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave.git?


[26-Sep-18 04:39 AM] prk#3209
Currently there are no rewards for mining?


[26-Sep-18 04:50 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hi all! I'll get a member of the dev team to come along as soon as they're free as I can't answer all of these questions myself unfortunately.

@prk - At the moment there are no block rewards, that's correct, but transaction rewards (which are of course very small!) are available.


[26-Sep-18 04:51 AM] arweave-india#5075
@Bill Hi, thanks for joining us here from Telegram   

Like I mentioned over there - Re: git clone, yes you can use git clone, and then git checkout develop which will get you up to date


[26-Sep-18 04:59 AM] prk#3209
@arweave-india any ETA on when the real mining starts?


[26-Sep-18 05:19 AM] arweave-india#5075
@prk It's triggered by a specific block height being reached - though I'm not sure off the top of my head what the height is. The block time will change when N.1.5. comes out of beta, and I believe the last time I spoke to Sam about this he said the block rewards realistically won't begin until after N.1.5. officially launches


[26-Sep-18 05:19 AM] arweave-india#5075

[26-Sep-18 12:26 PM] arweave-india#5075
@Vilenarios when you go to http://127.0.0.1:1984/info (with your node running) does it show 'release:8' in the output?


[26-Sep-18 12:26 PM] arweave-india#5075
@Joel Yep! All the same functionality, just smaller.


[26-Sep-18 12:26 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Yes it does show release:8


[26-Sep-18 12:27 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Is that what it’s supposed to show @arweave-india


[26-Sep-18 12:33 PM] arweave-india#5075
Ah that's great, you are on the 1.5-BETA. The main tag will be bumped for the stable release.


[26-Sep-18 12:41 PM] Joel#5880
Right, so I've had my PC running for 6 weeks getting to 48,000 and now it's starting all over again? It downloads 3 blocks every 2 minutes, even after the Beta. So it will take around 2 weeks to get to 60,000. Just checking that everyone's in the same boat, or am I missing something?


[26-Sep-18 01:33 PM] tiamat#9131
I guess once the beta turns out to be stable, getting blocks will be  much faster since they are so "tiny" now


[26-Sep-18 02:54 PM] arweave-india#5075
You won't need to download all of the blocks again, @Joel , they will slowly be turned into tiny blocks. @tiamat is right that downloading will be much faster as more people start to use the 1.5 software. 1.5 nodes serve tiny blocks to other 1.5 nodes, but big blocks to 1.1 nodes. 1.1 nodes will serve full blocks to 1.5 nodes however, so it is just a matter of the network slowly switching over.


[26-Sep-18 03:21 PM] Joel#5880
Hmm I just don't understand why I can see via my log that blocks are being written to disk every 40 seconds or so. Yet when I monitor the 'Blocks' folder, the file count doesn't increase. Additionally, if I search for the block that has just been written to disk, I can find it, and I see that it was the last block written. However, the number of items in the folder hasn't increased, therefore, surely the block just written has replaced an existing block. Whether it's the same block number or a different one is hard to tell. In the last 2 hours, the file count has risen by about 40 blocks, yet the log shows around 180 blocks being downloaded. This leads me to believe that I've downloaded 40 blocks that I never had, and re-downloaded 140 blocks that I already had, albeit smaller in size.


[27-Sep-18 01:00 AM] Marcin#0065
Same case in my system. Its weird indeed


[27-Sep-18 01:57 AM] Joel#5880
Ok, so I've added the 'Date Created' column and compared against the 'Date Modified' column; now I can definitely see that most of the blocks being written to disk are simply modifying existing blocks. So @arweave-india, you said that I won't have to download all of the blocks again, but I think that's exactly what is happening. Can someone explain what the initial ~100GB we downloaded before the 1.5Beta was for, if the same amount of blocks are now going to be ~60MB? Just trying to understand what's happening  


[27-Sep-18 02:20 AM] Marcin#0065
We should shut off the miner and wait till block 65700 or 1.5. Its a waste of energy for now and totally useless


[27-Sep-18 02:33 AM] Tommyj#8820
I just turned mine off. Can I have a refund for all my electricity wastage?


[27-Sep-18 04:31 AM] Marcin#0065

[27-Sep-18 06:41 AM] Tommyj#8820
Payment is OK in AR.


[27-Sep-18 09:41 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@Joel those blocks are being written to disk again, yes, but they are not being redownload. The system picks a random block, 'gets' it (if on disk already it just reads locally, if not held locally it retreives it from a peer) then writes it to disk with the new format.


[27-Sep-18 09:47 AM] Joel#5880
Perfect, thank you, @arweave-sam  


[27-Sep-18 09:53 AM] arweave-sam#9630
No problem at all :).


[28-Sep-18 01:32 PM] tiamat#9131
what is node_state_latency ?


[28-Sep-18 01:35 PM] Marcin#0065
After the 1.5 launch, will all block afterwards be smaller, or the block before too? 
Will there be any difference between deleti g 150gb of blocks and start over again?


[29-Sep-18 01:16 AM] arweave-sam#9630
> node_state_latency

This refers to the amount of time taken to contact the internal node processes of the host. Because the system is written in Erlang it is actually a large collection of asynchronous processes that handle different tasks. We use this metric to check that access to the core processes is still running smoothly.


[29-Sep-18 01:22 AM] arweave-sam#9630
> will all block afterwards be smaller, or the block before too? 

All blocks, before and after. You will get the new blocks faster if you convert, and subsequently spend some more time actively hashing.

For the Arweave.N.2 release we are working towards having the storage of the wallet lists completely optional for blocks more than 50 blocks old. This will cutdown on the storage overhead of the weave to the point that it is miniscule, freeing up space in the network for storage of actual data. Unlike 1.5 however, this further minification of blocks would not work on the previous blocks in the network, only new ones.


[29-Sep-18 02:15 AM] Marcin#0065
>All blocks, before and after. You will get the new blocks faster if you convert, and subsequently spend some more time actively hashing.

nice. do you plan to bring out some sort of GUI?
Could be used for pasting the mining adress, the number of used cores and the saving path and all other features? Is it hard  to create some sort of gui which takes all options chosen and translates it into the command line for the terminal (for ubuntu eg?)
Would be way more user friendly for noobs like me  


[29-Sep-18 02:16 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep, GUI is definitely on the agenda!


[29-Sep-18 02:16 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We would like it to have stats etc, too, though so it might take a little while

what is ADR%/NODE and POA RATE ?


[29-Sep-18 03:59 AM] arweave-sam#9630
ADR shows average replications of the blockweave (only polling our nodes at the moment -- the network stats on the upcoming site will ping all nodes). 100% implies that every node holds the full weave.

POA rate refers to the effective mining rate of the net in proof of access.

I counted around 70 nodes but arweave.org says 37 , does it report only those of a specific version  or how does it count?


[29-Sep-18 05:28 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I believe that counter is only polling one node


[29-Sep-18 05:28 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I count 55 live nodes on the net right now


[01-Oct-18 05:33 AM] codybartfast#9308
I think both the 70 and 50 are right     There are  about 70 different addresses that get returned as the result of 'peers' requests but only 50-ish are in good standing, the rest are mainly invalid ip addresses or unresponsive addresses:

Nice report, thank you :)

Yes, you are correct about the 50/70 differentiation

what is net-explorer?


[01-Oct-18 06:28 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Is is a network visualisation tool I was working on on Saturday


[01-Oct-18 06:28 AM] arweave-sam#9630
*It is


[01-Oct-18 06:28 AM] arweave-sam#9630
It can build a map of the interconnections between nodes


[01-Oct-18 06:29 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Unfortunately right now it isn't very useful because it doesn't factor in Wildfire communication prioritisation


[01-Oct-18 06:29 AM] arweave-sam#9630
It will only show you 'node A believes nodes B, C and D to be peers' (rather than 'node A will always send data to B first, then C, and will occasionally send data to D' and so on)


[01-Oct-18 06:29 AM] arweave-sam#9630
My new profile picture is actually a first rendering of that  


[01-Oct-18 06:35 AM] tiamat#9131
If a node  serves a lot of files, will this be counted to Wildfire? Do other nodes know when someone serves files?


[01-Oct-18 06:36 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Each node keeps an internal representation of it's known peers and their relative serving speeds


[01-Oct-18 06:39 AM] tiamat#9131
will 1.5 final version come with more features or just like the beta only with some fine tuning&bug fixes?


[01-Oct-18 06:48 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Just bug fixes and fine tuning for the full release


[01-Oct-18 08:00 AM] Mike#2447
Does anyone have experience comparing Ryzen processors to Intel Core in regards to Arweave hash rates?  I'm thinking about picking up either a Ryzen 2700X or Core i7 8700(K) for a dedicated Arweave miner.  I'm leaning towards the 2700X, but have only been running on Intel hardware thus far.

Email india@arweave.org and ask to be added to the mailing list and you should receive the instructions.

Afraid not, but I would love to know! Would be neat to get a community benchmarking site put together at some point


[02-Oct-18 03:45 PM] zempbrand#6893
@arweave-sam I dont believe there is much of a difference between Ryzen and Intel CPUs, other than their compatibility with motherboards. I prefer Intel when mining.

What is the new target block time?


[02-Oct-18 07:27 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Target block time is still 2 minutes, but we enough a minimum difficulty level. We expect it will be back around that mark once the token rewards kick in

there are less and less miners, I've seen yesterday 1h+ between blocks, why everyone backs off?


[04-Oct-18 12:44 AM] codybartfast#9308
From the Department of Wild Speculation:   the nodes we are not seeing are probably those with address `T414mkfW...` which also seems to have faded  away.  That was an early, prolific miner that I assumed was the Arweave team.  Perhaps the Arweave team is taking their miners off the field so they won't be competing for mining reward when they start?


[04-Oct-18 08:40 AM] Mike#2447

[04-Oct-18 02:32 PM] Mike#2447
@arweave-sam On 2 separate miners, it went from daily logs of about 2 MB on average to tens of MB.  I've had a few go over 100 MB.  I will try to DM you some of them later today.

Thanks, we would appreciate that. We haven't seen the same behaviour on any of our nodes.


[04-Oct-18 03:11 PM] Marcin#0065
the biggest logfile i got is 16 MB. 
the mining has stopped for a long time, its just downloading blocks. a restart of the process does help sometimes, but as for now the pc is idle all time. any changes occured lately?


[04-Oct-18 04:04 PM] arweave-sam#9630
None that are particularly important since the 1.5-BETA-1 release. Do you see any errors in your logs after the last instance of accepted_foreign_block, @Marcin ?


[04-Oct-18 11:30 PM] codybartfast#9308
I had large log files start from 29th, a while after updating to 1.5.  Seemed to be caused by a small number of large log entries where the whole of the data is being written to log.  E.g. 900KB long lines.  There's different messages with the big data (badarith, uknown_message_node,  function_clause - ar_util - decode) some are base64 some are decimal  digit lists.  Not seen the issue since yesterday morning.  Perhaps  related to more/larger transactions?


[05-Oct-18 12:22 AM] Marcin#0065
according to the log i didnt have such case, there is no "accepted_foreign_block" in the last 24 hours and longer @arweave-sam .
it only "writing_block_t_disk" and from time to time an "alarm_handler: {clear,system_memory_high_watermark}"

But usually the log look slike that:

could you maybe provide an official mining command with peers and so on?
i  use a mining command with an ip list which is generated with wireshark during upvest time. not th ebest solution so far. thx


[05-Oct-18 12:46 AM] Marcin#0065
around 200 blocks per days coming new to disk in real. 
at the moment its just pure waste of energy to let the systems run for you. Maybe you could start roll out the block rewards sooner? Letting my whole system be in idle all the weeks seems not very smart to me, i dont feel well with that any more


[05-Oct-18 12:50 AM] codybartfast#9308
@Marcin   Any chance there's a network issue?  I've seen that when my miner could reach the network but the network could not reach the miner.  (I've just done my little peer scan thingy so  you might want to check if your public ip is on here:  http://www.codybartfast.com/arw/peer_discovery/20181005.html)


[05-Oct-18 12:53 AM] codybartfast#9308
But I think there might also be an issue with the speed at which blocks are being distributed.  I can't say for sure, but comparing when my block height increases with the block mine time (thank you ViewBlock) it seems it can take 3-4 minutes for me to get a block, so when blocks are being mined every 2minutes and block N is successfully mined I'm still banging away looking for block (N-1) or even (N-2).


[05-Oct-18 12:15 PM] Marcin#0065
My public ip is changing almost daily, i cant say if im on there :)


[05-Oct-18 12:16 PM] Joel#5880

[05-Oct-18 01:11 PM] Vilenarios#8742

[05-Oct-18 01:11 PM] Vilenarios#8742
My block folder is so much bigger


[05-Oct-18 01:12 PM] tiamat#9131
that is uploaded files only, blocks are not included


[05-Oct-18 01:18 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Damn. I hope we get more nodes or else our HDs gonna fill up quick once actual files are uploaded.


[05-Oct-18 02:33 PM] arweave-sam#9630
> My public ip is changing almost daily, i cant say if im on there :)

@Marcin this sounds like the problem. Other nodes won't be able to find you to post new blocks to if your IP consistently switches. You will also lose your wildfire peer score, as (for the purposes of other nodes in the network) your identity has changed.


[05-Oct-18 02:34 PM] arweave-sam#9630
> Damn. I hope we get more nodes or else our HDs gonna fill up quick once actual files are uploaded.

Your blocks directory should shrink dramatically after you leave the 1.5 version running for a while


[05-Oct-18 02:34 PM] arweave-sam#9630
( @Vilenarios )


[05-Oct-18 02:35 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Thanks Sam. I will take another look.


[05-Oct-18 02:37 PM] arweave-sam#9630
NP  


[05-Oct-18 03:03 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Also, an update regarding logging:

The latest development version of 1.5 now makes logging of interface checks optional (default off). This means that the many 'writing_block_to_disk' messages will not normally show, now. You can re-enable these messages (if you desire) by appending `enable disk_logging` to your command line arguments.


[05-Oct-18 03:04 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Further, if you would like to log http requests on the latest development version you can also add `enable http_logging`


[05-Oct-18 03:40 PM] Marcin#0065
@arweave-sam  this sounds like the problem. Other nodes won't be able to find you to post new blocks to if your IP consistently switches. You will also lose your wildfire peer score, as (for the purposes of other nodes in the network) your identity has changed.

cant it just be tracked by the given mining adress?

i cant help that we got shitload old ipv4 connection still in germany and distributors who change my ip daily xD i try to figure out if i can get a static ip


[05-Oct-18 03:41 PM] arweave-sam#9630
> shitload old ipv4 connection still in germany

Haha, this is something the team is learning to live with, too.


[05-Oct-18 03:42 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We considered making reputation bound to addresses, but sometimes people use the same address across multiple miners


[05-Oct-18 03:44 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Also, it gives the potential for a malicious actor with many resources to force reorganisations of the network topology. This wouldn't be too bad even if it were to happen, but we wouldn't like to introduce the possibility of it.


[05-Oct-18 03:45 PM] Marcin#0065
so what can i do? as a consumer im dependant on (in my case o2 provider) who is changing ip adresses. i cant say how often it happens. do you have an idea for such a problem? a workaround?


[05-Oct-18 03:49 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Polling mode was built for this


[05-Oct-18 03:49 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It makes your logs slightly messier (lots of 'starting fork recovery'), but it should allow you to stay in sync with the network.


[05-Oct-18 03:50 PM] Marcin#0065
oh nice. that would help maybe  


[05-Oct-18 03:51 PM] Marcin#0065
is there an official mining command so far? i still use some ip adresses which got wiresharked, but it looks pretty messy. any clean solution to just joing the network without givin specific ip adresses?


[05-Oct-18 03:54 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We don't embed IPs into the build because with Arweave you need to trust the nodes you join on. Making everyone that clones the repo trust our nodes by default is the kind of centralisation that we would like to avoid.


[05-Oct-18 03:54 PM] arweave-sam#9630
So I am afraid that you have to provide an IP, for now


[05-Oct-18 03:56 PM] Marcin#0065
and one more question:
are the file in the "blocks" folders the real blocks? my highest number in the filename is block 66372 (since a file in hte block folder, i assume its the block nr. 66372). But as we all can we its almost 10k ahead, so i get misleas somehow. why is that so?


[05-Oct-18 03:56 PM] Marcin#0065
or what does that number represent?


[05-Oct-18 04:00 PM] arweave-sam#9630
That is indeed the block height. From what I can tell your node must have desynced from the network at some point before the minimum difficulty was enforced. This would make sense given the connectivity issue we were discussing previously. The `polling` command line option should make sure that does not happen again.


[05-Oct-18 04:01 PM] Marcin#0065
where can i find the information about the polling? i tried to look around the folders for some documents explaining it, i remember there was one with the command explanation


[05-Oct-18 04:02 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Just run `./arweave-server` and you will see the help  


[05-Oct-18 04:03 PM] Marcin#0065
:d thx


[05-Oct-18 04:04 PM] Marcin#0065
 


[05-Oct-18 04:06 PM] Marcin#0065
can i just delete all my blocks now and just start over again? would save me some space  


[05-Oct-18 04:09 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Could, do but I believe we have pruner you could run


[05-Oct-18 04:09 PM] arweave-sam#9630
One sec


[05-Oct-18 04:10 PM] Marcin#0065
maybe provide some trusted ip adresses? i got many, but i dont know if u can trust them


[05-Oct-18 04:11 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Hmm, I appear to be wrong. Apologies. Dead block pruner goes on the feature list!


[05-Oct-18 04:11 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Sure, if you trust me you can trust `52.33.231.154`


[05-Oct-18 04:12 PM] arweave-sam#9630
All you need is one node to join the net, then you will find other (untrusted) peers through it


[05-Oct-18 04:12 PM] Marcin#0065
i go tthat ip on my list  


[05-Oct-18 04:12 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Haha, great


[05-Oct-18 04:12 PM] Marcin#0065
my command  


[05-Oct-18 04:13 PM] Marcin#0065
i got to run them all now,


[05-Oct-18 04:13 PM] Marcin#0065
how to they priritize which ip get taken?


[05-Oct-18 04:13 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It is the first IP that is up that will be used


[05-Oct-18 04:13 PM] Marcin#0065
can i give them orders, i would put your to the top then


[05-Oct-18 04:13 PM] Marcin#0065
ahh okay


[05-Oct-18 04:14 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We provided many in the original email in case some went down for some reason


[05-Oct-18 04:14 PM] arweave-sam#9630
(They did)


[05-Oct-18 04:14 PM] arweave-sam#9630
But one is normally enough


[05-Oct-18 04:16 PM] Marcin#0065
okay ill try out


[05-Oct-18 04:17 PM] Marcin#0065
any specific order to put polling in?  its okay to put that command to the end ?


[05-Oct-18 04:17 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep! That is fine


[05-Oct-18 04:18 PM] Marcin#0065
is "port 1984" as command correct?


[05-Oct-18 04:18 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Anywhere is ok, just as long as it is not between a keyword (like 'peers' and the argument)


[05-Oct-18 04:19 PM] arweave-sam#9630
`port xxxx` specifies the local port that other nodes should contact you on, so in this case you can omit it (as you are in polling mode)


[05-Oct-18 04:19 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It will default to 1984, too


[05-Oct-18 04:19 PM] Marcin#0065
okay thx


[05-Oct-18 04:20 PM] Marcin#0065
i renamed the blocks folder and created a new folder "blocks" with "enc" and "invalid" inside. will i get in trouble with that?


[05-Oct-18 04:21 PM] arweave-sam#9630
That should be fine  


[05-Oct-18 04:25 PM] Marcin#0065
looks good i think


[05-Oct-18 04:25 PM] Marcin#0065
the highest block numbers are the correct heights now


[05-Oct-18 04:26 PM] arweave-sam#9630

[05-Oct-18 04:28 PM] Marcin#0065
the very moment 1.5 launches, will there be a block converter available to shrink the size ? will that happen by command?


[05-Oct-18 04:29 PM] Marcin#0065
or will it be easiert to just delete all the block again and start downloading the small one quicker


[05-Oct-18 04:30 PM] arweave-sam#9630

Anytime  


[05-Oct-18 04:35 PM] Marcin#0065
in case to get lucky enough to get a block calculated by my small system, can i let the log track specific cammd like "reward adress: xx"or whatever to see a counter?


[05-Oct-18 04:37 PM] arweave-sam#9630
You will see `accepted_block` in the log in that case


[05-Oct-18 04:38 PM] arweave-sam#9630
(Rather than `accepted_foreign_block`)


[05-Oct-18 04:38 PM] Marcin#0065
okay thx

what reason can there be to prevent mining?

I think you are missing the recall blocks


[06-Oct-18 12:20 AM] tiamat#9131
it should work after you have all blocks

Is there a rough rule for how long it takes to build a WildFire reputation?  I'm running on retail broadband and although it's a dynamic IP it only changes when the modem reboots, which isn't very often (typically weeks).   If rebooting only punished me for a day or so I might continue without polling.


[06-Oct-18 03:54 AM] Marcin#0065
if i have an ipv6 adress, will that solve the problem?


[06-Oct-18 03:57 AM] Marcin#0065
ahh wait, its dynamic too... i hate my provider


[06-Oct-18 04:19 AM] tiamat#9131
for ipv6 I think you could use some tunneling to have it fixed, but that could add some lag


[06-Oct-18 07:14 AM] Joel#5880
Am I realistically ever going to catch up with the network height? I've been about 8,000 behind for about a month now   and have been constantly downloading from the 27th August...currently at 50700. Very frustrating!


[06-Oct-18 09:12 AM] tiamat#9131
I  think once everyone upgrades to 1.5 you will no longer have this issue


[06-Oct-18 09:13 AM] tiamat#9131
I speculate that some settings would be adjusted to get these tiny blocks faster since they won't create so much traffic


[06-Oct-18 11:02 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@tiamat is right: after everyone switches to 1.5, the download speed will be much faster and the network traffic greatly reduced. For reference, currently when you ask for a block about ~2mb of traffic is generated. After 1.5 this generates about 700 bytes of traffic.

This should be fine for now. Wildfire is  a competition, so while the peer count is low and the average network connectivity is not too high you don't have anything to worry about. As the competition heats up you might have to change your configuration.

Is anyone willing to claim the following addresses?  Together they currently account for about 85% of the mined blocks.

[07-Oct-18 12:01 PM] rehash#3438
One of them is mine


[07-Oct-18 12:40 PM] tiamat#9131
83 transactions so far today, does this mean anything?


[07-Oct-18 12:44 PM] Mike#2447
I was curious if any of them were managed by the dev team.  The number of blocks mined generally translates to hashing power and if one individual is controling that much of the network, I would be concerned.


[07-Oct-18 12:46 PM] Mike#2447
@rehash Do you mind me asking what hardware you're using?


[07-Oct-18 12:57 PM] tiamat#9131
I think the number of nodes is more important than hashing power? Did the team ever commented about Sybil attacks and things like this?


[07-Oct-18 12:58 PM] tiamat#9131
I'm also very curious if miners will have to serve files to end users or only to other nodes.


[07-Oct-18 12:59 PM] tiamat#9131
Once we get some adoption, will our nodes end users requests ? and if yes, will those count in mining score?


[07-Oct-18 01:02 PM] arweave-sam#9630
None of those are ours -- we have all of our nodes 'following', not mining at the moment.


[07-Oct-18 01:06 PM] arweave-sam#9630
> 83 transactions so far today, does this mean anything?

It is actually much higher than that, I think the Viewblock graphs are broken.

We are building a decentralised, immutable and censorship-resistant gateway to all of the data (or as much as possible) in the Internet Archive:

http://35.178.129.36:1984/tx/VaNdiDVtIlCbVLJQ97y5G9OhM0kkitOvlPdbLtOTgXI/data.html


[07-Oct-18 01:09 PM] arweave-sam#9630
> Is anyone willing to claim the following addresses?

On a similar note, is anyone here building the https://timehash.org app? If so, please reach out -- we are setting up a developer incentive programme :).


[07-Oct-18 01:10 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We would also be happy to offer integration help


[07-Oct-18 01:11 PM] tiamat#9131
why did you stop mining? is it temporary or it has to do with regulations? it means you are also not storing files?


[07-Oct-18 01:19 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We store and serve all of the data still, we just aren't hashing temporarily. Our goal is for the network to run perfectly without us, so this is a step in that direction.

We also don't want to be accused of pre-mining ;).


[07-Oct-18 01:20 PM] Marcin#0065
Is there any sense to let the miner run, since my ip is changing daily?


[07-Oct-18 01:21 PM] tiamat#9131
Yeah, I've heard voices on telegram that you guys were delaying things so your friends can fill their bags from premine, but those poor voices did not even know that rewards are not on.


[07-Oct-18 01:23 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@Marcin yes, with poll mode on this should be fine for now.


[07-Oct-18 01:31 PM] tiamat#9131
the  censorship-resistant gateway to IA looks very interesting  


[07-Oct-18 01:57 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Thanks! Yeah, we are pretty excited about it


[07-Oct-18 02:20 PM] Marcin#0065
what can the reason be, that the command is downloading blocks only, chilling in almost idle instead of computing?


[07-Oct-18 02:22 PM] tiamat#9131
I suspect you don't have enough blocks, so when recall block is asked you don't have it


[07-Oct-18 02:22 PM] tiamat#9131
check how many blocks you have in blocks directory


[07-Oct-18 02:23 PM] Marcin#0065
i have let run the command the last 48 hours. it hasnt kicked of once,


[07-Oct-18 02:23 PM] Marcin#0065
in that time i got around 10% of blocks


[07-Oct-18 02:23 PM] Marcin#0065
jezz, i hope that 1.5 comes soon, i cant downlaod 150 gb in that snail speed again.


[07-Oct-18 02:24 PM] arweave-sam#9630
You won't have to


[07-Oct-18 02:25 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We have had zero known issues with 1.5 for a couple of weeks now


[07-Oct-18 02:25 PM] Marcin#0065
so ready to launch?  


[07-Oct-18 02:26 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We will tag the develop branch as 1.5-RC-1 very soon, at which point I would recommend it as the default miner.


[07-Oct-18 02:27 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It has basically been ready for launch for a few weeks (a month?) now, we are just moving cautiously with it


[07-Oct-18 02:28 PM] Marcin#0065
i tried it out, it went well. but i pref to wait for a official like statement to move over  


[07-Oct-18 02:30 PM] tiamat#9131
how do know your miner never kicked in? did you grep miner logs/* ?


[07-Oct-18 02:30 PM] Marcin#0065
i follow the logs


[07-Oct-18 02:30 PM] Marcin#0065
and i follow the cpu usage


[07-Oct-18 02:31 PM] Marcin#0065
its chilling around, but i want my room warm  


[07-Oct-18 02:38 PM] tiamat#9131
with 10% of blocks it should definitely start from time to time, like once ever 10 blocks  


[07-Oct-18 02:39 PM] Marcin#0065
ye :/ i have that issue since the last weeks


[07-Oct-18 02:40 PM] Marcin#0065
i can fire up a fresh command, it works for a short while, but after that its just sitting there downloading as hell


[07-Oct-18 02:40 PM] arweave-sam#9630

[07-Oct-18 02:40 PM] Marcin#0065
rarely

Seems fine to me


[07-Oct-18 02:44 PM] tiamat#9131
I'd try without polling


[07-Oct-18 02:44 PM] Marcin#0065
so basicly, if people do not own all blocks, they are likely to ge tless chances to even start mining?


[07-Oct-18 02:45 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I think they get less chances for transactions


[07-Oct-18 02:45 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Depends how you define mining, but yes: fewer blocks, lower chance to take part in the hashing competition


[07-Oct-18 02:47 PM] Marcin#0065
im not here for profit at all, im not into that league. but i let my pc run to heat up the room xD and since im kinda in love with that project already back in 2017 when i started to run test networks too, i really want to let my pc run for arweave and do not bother daily to check if everything works fine


[07-Oct-18 02:48 PM] Marcin#0065
using 1.5 with the small blocks, will if download the block faster? im sry, i do not have much time lately to follow up all information very carefully.
ill try out the beta 1.5 now


[07-Oct-18 02:48 PM] Marcin#0065
i see lot of forkes in the logs too, maybe worth mentioning?

Yes, after everyone upgrades to 1.5 downloading the blocks will be much faster.

The whole weave should be about 500mb


[07-Oct-18 02:50 PM] tiamat#9131
but the wallet_lists is still big


[07-Oct-18 02:50 PM] arweave-sam#9630
If you are using polling you will get lots of those messages


[07-Oct-18 02:50 PM] Marcin#0065
but i need to use polling, since my provider gives me a new ipv4 AND ipv6 adress every 4am in the moring


[07-Oct-18 02:51 PM] arweave-sam#9630
That 500mb includes all of the WLs. But after N.2 you won't need to store the old WLs either.

i see the words, i understand each one of them, but together they are like chinese to me  


[08-Oct-18 02:31 PM] Marcin#0065
i got like 62k blocks which i dont know if worth to overwrite or not, since they seem to be outsynced pretty hard, around 68k the highest block number


[08-Oct-18 02:31 PM] tiamat#9131
after you start the miner, you end up with something like: started_auto_updater
    watch_address:


[08-Oct-18 02:31 PM] tiamat#9131
if you pus enter, you will get a terminal


[08-Oct-18 02:31 PM] tiamat#9131
*push


[08-Oct-18 02:31 PM] Marcin#0065
thx tiamat  


[08-Oct-18 02:32 PM] tiamat#9131
I guess the cleanup with start from the first block and delete duplicates/higher invalid blocks and convert to tiny format


[08-Oct-18 02:33 PM] Marcin#0065
that would be neat


[08-Oct-18 02:35 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Thanks @tiamat


[08-Oct-18 02:35 PM] arweave-sam#9630
The rewrite command will only rewrite the blocks, you will have to run the following afterwards in order to remove the other blocks


[08-Oct-18 02:36 PM] arweave-sam#9630
`ar_cleanup:remove_invalid_blocks(ar_node:get_hash_list(whereis(http_entrypoint_node))).`


[08-Oct-18 02:38 PM] Marcin#0065
1> ar_cleanup:remove_invalid_blocks(ar_node:get_hash_list(whereis(http_entrypoint_node))).
ok
2>


[08-Oct-18 02:39 PM] Marcin#0065
how long may it take? as for now, the highes block number is 66372

[08-Oct-18 02:41 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I have added a function that glues these two pieces of the cleanup together, so running `ar_cleanup:all()` will handle the entire process. It will be in N.1.5-RC-2.


[08-Oct-18 02:41 PM] Marcin#0065
"Rewriting all blocks (this may take a very long time...)

 


[08-Oct-18 02:41 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Indeed


[08-Oct-18 02:41 PM] arweave-sam#9630
For the whole weave we are talking over 24 hours, I expect


[08-Oct-18 02:42 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Depending on the speed of your SSD/HDD


[08-Oct-18 02:43 PM] Joel#5880
So running ar_cleanup:all() will also rewrite old to new, within 24 hours?


[08-Oct-18 02:43 PM] Joel#5880
Over 24 hours*


[08-Oct-18 02:43 PM] Marcin#0065
i got time


[08-Oct-18 02:44 PM] Marcin#0065
as long it will work smooth


[08-Oct-18 02:44 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep, but it is not in the latest tagged release, it will be in the next one.


[08-Oct-18 02:44 PM] Joel#5880
It's cool, I'm just checking that will do the whole thing... I would have done it decades ago if only I'd known  


[08-Oct-18 02:57 PM] Marcin#0065
i dont have the feelin the command:
ar_cleanup:remove_invalid_blocks(ar_node:get_hash_list(whereis(http_entrypoint_node))).
does anything right now. the number of blocks is not changing, nor are the wrong blocks deleted


[08-Oct-18 03:03 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Has the node that you are running it on joined the network already?


[08-Oct-18 03:06 PM] Marcin#0065
think so yes.


[08-Oct-18 03:06 PM] Marcin#0065
its ur ip im using  


[08-Oct-18 03:07 PM] Marcin#0065
wait a moment, i just saw a decrese in space while increase in block number, something is happening


[08-Oct-18 03:08 PM] Marcin#0065
other topic, i got some polling issue maybe? what does it mean?

you seem to be getting into lots of issues, maybe consider restarting with a latest fresh install?


[08-Oct-18 03:19 PM] Marcin#0065
i just did a fresh pull :/


[08-Oct-18 03:21 PM] tiamat#9131
cleanup seems to be working nice, I see a lot of: rewrote_block: <<"cjnka .... in logs


[08-Oct-18 03:26 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Thanks @Marcin , I think that `ar_poller` issue is actually a bug. Thanks for reporting!


[08-Oct-18 03:26 PM] arweave-sam#9630
This will be why your node is falling out of sync in polling mode


[08-Oct-18 03:27 PM] Marcin#0065
probably yes   due to the block number i live in the futre already bois xD


[08-Oct-18 03:28 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Should be fixed in RC-2


[08-Oct-18 03:29 PM] tiamat#9131
meanwhile you should give it a try without polling, I know I repeat myself  


[08-Oct-18 03:29 PM] Marcin#0065
but i felt out of sync without using poll in first place :S


[08-Oct-18 03:29 PM] Marcin#0065
im using poll since 2 days only, never had it in my command line b4


[08-Oct-18 03:29 PM] tiamat#9131
ah, ok


[08-Oct-18 03:30 PM] Marcin#0065
i felt out of sync due to new ip i guess?


[08-Oct-18 03:30 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep, that will just cause the new IP-- exactly


[08-Oct-18 03:30 PM] Marcin#0065
soi i have no choice atm to fall out of sync?  


[08-Oct-18 03:30 PM] tiamat#9131
RC-1 fixed some fork issue


[08-Oct-18 03:31 PM] arweave-sam#9630
You could checkout 'develop' itself, if you would like, but we don't officially support that(!!)


[08-Oct-18 03:32 PM] Marcin#0065
i keep waiting   i just switched back to my almost 70k blocks, the minign is goign on full tiem now and heating is working   ill make a pull when the new version will come out, meanwhile i keep screwing up with some commands.


[08-Oct-18 03:33 PM] tiamat#9131
why would a new ip desync? you only should restart the node when IP changes, maybe use a crontab?


[08-Oct-18 03:33 PM] Marcin#0065
i get a new ip every 4am daily, which is pretty annoying


[08-Oct-18 03:35 PM] Marcin#0065
i do not see any rewrite infos in the log, but somehow my block folder is 200mb slimmer since  20 minutes ago


[08-Oct-18 03:36 PM] Marcin#0065
while 50 block added in sam etime


[08-Oct-18 03:37 PM] arweave-sam#9630
The joiner will slowly rewrite the blocks naturally as it downloads the weave, so that is probably what you are seeing


[08-Oct-18 03:37 PM] arweave-sam#9630
If you are really interested you can run `ar_meta_db:put(disk_logging, true).`


[08-Oct-18 03:37 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Which will show you what is going on with disk writes


[08-Oct-18 03:38 PM] Marcin#0065
im kinda stuck with that command


[08-Oct-18 03:38 PM] Marcin#0065
ar_cleanup:remove_invalid_blocks(ar_node:get_hash_list(whereis(http_entrypoint_node))).

which doesnt allo wme to fire up the next one?


[08-Oct-18 03:38 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Ah, that is true


[08-Oct-18 03:40 PM] Marcin#0065
i restart it


[08-Oct-18 03:42 PM] Marcin#0065
is it:
ar_cleanup:rewrite().

ar_cleanup:rewrite().<enter>


[08-Oct-18 03:42 PM] Marcin#0065
for copy paste reasons


[08-Oct-18 03:42 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Type this `ar_cleanup:rewrite().` then press enter


[08-Oct-18 03:44 PM] Marcin#0065
oh boy it rewriting as hell right now

I need to do that. My miner been running for 7 days straight and only decreased like 10 gb


[09-Oct-18 01:58 AM] Joel#5880
So I've 'git cloned', copied 'txs' and 'Blocks' directories across, then 'git checkout develop' which works fine. Then I run the miner and hit <enter> at the end, which gives me '1>' terminal. At which point I enter 'ar_cleanup:all()' which just gives me another '1>'. When I run 'make log' in another session I'm now getting:

cheers @tiamat copying wallet_lists.  


[09-Oct-18 07:36 AM] Joel#5880
Hi @Marcin, How did you get the rewriting to go so fast? I don't think mine's rewriting locally. Also how are you monitoring this? I'm just using 'make log' :/


[09-Oct-18 08:33 AM] tiamat#9131
I get like 1 conversion/second

with ssd


[09-Oct-18 10:23 AM] Marcin#0065
@Joel If you are really interested you can run ar_meta_db:put(disk_logging, true).


[09-Oct-18 10:24 AM] Marcin#0065
Which will show you what is going on with disk writes


[09-Oct-18 10:24 AM] Marcin#0065
From sam above


[09-Oct-18 10:27 AM] Marcin#0065
Atm i get outsynced every day, so i wait till the polling will work somehow and then ill try over again


[09-Oct-18 11:38 AM] Marcin#0065
sam, when going to :
http://35.178.129.36:1984/  directly i get

{"network":"arweave.N.1","version":3,"release":8,"height":60836,"current":"jACBIfAQiZLYqvk9el85RuYLxH7XbI8oD1tadnazwpboACf9Z0eWSnpYCR9Yw-Wx","blocks":78789,"peers":52,"queue_length":0,"node_state_latency":9132}

why is there 78k blocks already?


[09-Oct-18 11:39 AM] Marcin#0065
is 78789 referring to something else?


[09-Oct-18 12:27 PM] Mike#2447
@Marcin Didn't you say that you were off on your own chain (weave) for a while and got way ahead?  The number given should closely match the number of blocks in your blocks folder.  A bunch of those are likely invalid.


[09-Oct-18 12:36 PM] Mike#2447
@arweave-sam This portion of log seems to indicate the same block (60819) has 2 different reward addresses.  Am I mistaken?  Can you explain what is happening here?

[09-Oct-18 01:46 PM] Joel#5880
@Marcin yeah I saw that, but I wasn't sure where to run it, Erlang or Arweave Server command?...


[09-Oct-18 01:46 PM] Marcin#0065
i think erlang


[09-Oct-18 01:46 PM] Marcin#0065
after u fire up ur mining command


[09-Oct-18 01:46 PM] Marcin#0065
u suppose to press enter

Yeah I tried, but it just returns another "1>"


[09-Oct-18 01:48 PM] Joel#5880

[09-Oct-18 01:48 PM] Marcin#0065
ye


[09-Oct-18 01:48 PM] Marcin#0065

[09-Oct-18 02:06 PM] Joel#5880
Yeah...


[09-Oct-18 02:06 PM] Marcin#0065

Not yet, but it's doing the initial 50 block to write thing first I guess, like it usually does...


[09-Oct-18 02:07 PM] Marcin#0065
oh ye


[09-Oct-18 02:07 PM] Marcin#0065
fire up the rewrite command after the 50 initial block


[09-Oct-18 02:08 PM] Joel#5880
Ahh ok, I'll let you know. Cheers both


[09-Oct-18 02:51 PM] Joel#5880
Working now :)... is it still downloading new blocks as well?


[09-Oct-18 02:51 PM] Marcin#0065
yes


[09-Oct-18 02:51 PM] Marcin#0065
i gave up on mine. it stopped after 40 minutes again


[09-Oct-18 02:51 PM] Marcin#0065
i just run the rc1 freshly xD


[09-Oct-18 02:53 PM] Joel#5880
Ahh lol... well at the moment I've limited my cpu to 10% until the actual release. Maybe running at low resource will allow it to run for longer?


[10-Oct-18 02:39 AM] Joel#5880
Ahh I think "ar_cleanup:rewrite()." goes from Block 0. So if you re-run, it rewrites the tiny blocks again? Can this be changed? Or would it involve too much overhead in processing? Or is it possible to do something temporarily to say <If block is >200KB then rewrite, else skip block>?


[11-Oct-18 12:45 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Thanks, Joel, I will add it to the feature queue  


[11-Oct-18 07:07 AM] Marcin#0065
Can we maybe get a simple gui, where all the commands exist as simple buttons? It cant be too hard to put in a ar adress, click all the setting you need (poling, peers etc.) and press "start". Boom, your pc is joining. Most ico get gui in early stages, while arweave has ass-complicated, non documented, mining procedures. Ofc its working somehow, but i cant imagine many people want to go through all the commands.
Take a look on NOIA, a similar project, but nice gui already.
All after mainnet launch. Ofc i dont want to compare the whole project itselft, and i hate to critisise too much, but without adoption for the masses, that kind of project might die quicker than crypto-cat. And for mass adoption you cant reach ubuntu user after basic informatics classes only.


[11-Oct-18 07:39 AM] tiamat#9131
Actually the process is very easy, 1)get he files with git and 2) start the node


[11-Oct-18 07:39 AM] tiamat#9131
I don't think team should waste valuable time on this


[11-Oct-18 08:03 AM] Marcin#0065
I think ur approaching it wrongly. Let me pls explain what i mean.
By talking all time about an "dropbox-like" feature, arweave starts to compare itself to dropbox. An user interface to use it is a must to even try talk like that. But it all aint working well, if you have few people in the world, who are able to let a miner run (an here we get to the point of decentealization). So speaking of a decentralized storage project you MUST reach a lot miner around the globe who are willing to give disk space for the network. 
And here we start. Using ubuntu you eliminate already some part of the potential miner (but i dont think its a problem in here). Secondly, you type in the code, firstly you may think its working. But small issues like disconnects, may cause getting out of sync. 
But there are a lot people, who do not even know what git is for. 
If a new version comes out, you do not have the new files in the folders automatically. 
The way it is now, its either wont stand, coz too few miners are joined and not enough disk space will be left, or you gonna have very few miner mining and deciding whats in the weave. Not a good point to push adds for decentralized storage. 
We do not have a lot miner today, even weeks after mainnet launch. How do you imagine to stand a chance agains all the people tryying out to use the "dropbox like" feature, when it launches? Im afraid the first impression wont be good, coz it will be slow and expencive. And the first jmpression is very important in my mind. 
So why not having a gui for everyone, let stay in ubuntu. Ubhntu wont he hard to install for everyone. But after that, all there should be is a 1. Gui 2. basic settings like path to storage (why no multiple disk storage management?), adress, max cores, max storage etc. and 3. a simple "start mining" button. Everyone would join the network that way, coz its easier than all that terminal commands. Pls have in mind you want to reach people who never used a terminal nor ubuntu


[11-Oct-18 09:08 AM] tiamat#9131
Of course a GUI can't hurt, but I don't it is a top priority right now. For many, fine tuning is much easier done in console/config files than in GUI.  The number of miners will grow after rewards will be enabled.


[11-Oct-18 09:09 AM] tiamat#9131
Arweave is a revolutionary platform that can only grow organically, not over night.


[11-Oct-18 03:12 PM] Marcin#0065
What about: 
Actually the process is very easy, 1)get he files with git and 2) start the node
??
Ive been mining since back then in 2017, when there were around 15 computer in the network. It has been changing since then constantly and was fun to track the process. If it keeps changing that way in future, we cannot expect from people to rely on terminal codes, especially when it comes to fine tuning.
As the russians said: nobody needs computer woth gui, it costs ressourses only, computer with gui wont success ;)


[11-Oct-18 03:14 PM] Marcin#0065
Im happy to you, that ur fine with that. But i also know the lazy perspective of people wothout it background or interest, and arweave wont reach those people with terminal console only. Thats why im sure there will be a gui sooner or later


[11-Oct-18 04:51 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Certainly in the longer-term we will be building a GUI for the miner, @Marcin , but as @tiamat correctly identified at this stage it is all about priorities.


[11-Oct-18 04:52 PM] arweave-sam#9630
An interesting interim solution might be to have a GUI people can use to generate a configuration or launch script.


[11-Oct-18 04:53 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I will add it to the feature request list, but if anyone is interested in starting a community project this might be a neat one!


[11-Oct-18 04:54 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It could be a simple HTML+JS+CSS page served from the Arweave's permaweb  


[11-Oct-18 05:00 PM] Mazzz#1871
Looking to start mining. What is the approximate profit at the moment?


[11-Oct-18 06:15 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@Mazzz mining rewards are scheduled to start next week! if you would like to keep informed about Arweave mining PM me your email and I will add you to the mailing list.

@Marcin http://52.56.119.91:1984/tx/UoFxfiSEt2iUHexqzpERhsgCq1Uv1_ZIjHMEoBt90U4/data.html


[11-Oct-18 06:16 PM] arweave-sam#9630
The styling is horrible, but it is a start. Would be great if anyone from the community with design skills could take a crack at restyling it (bounty available!) :).


[11-Oct-18 06:24 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I’d hope once arweave mining is turned on for real, and it lists on an exchange, that the community should pick up. Then we can see some of the gaps filled in terms of documentation, best practices and how to posted across the internet.


[11-Oct-18 06:24 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Just like other more commonly mined coins.


[11-Oct-18 06:25 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Get some YouTubers to make some videos on how to set it up and optimize.


[11-Oct-18 06:26 PM] Vilenarios#8742
The end user side of arweave though MUST have a simple interface similar to Dropbox or OneDrive.


[11-Oct-18 06:27 PM] Vilenarios#8742
@arweave-sam miner rewards next week is awesome to hear. Will we have to start with a clean blocks folder or it doesn’t matter?


[11-Oct-18 06:33 PM] arweave-sam#9630
No clean block folder, just continue as normal :(

how do rewards work in arweave?
is it seperated in transaction rewards and block ward as usual? 
or transaction rewardss only? 
how much is a block reward after block 65700, when slow onboarding ends?


[13-Oct-18 03:01 AM] Marcin#0065
hey sam, you mentioned once, that looking for messages like: "accepted block: xxx" calls out a mined block.

i get that message, i check out the block number on the explorer and its totally not matching at all.

why is it so?

may i be out of sync again, even i started all over again, with polling command?


[13-Oct-18 03:05 AM] Marcin#0065
also, everytime i join to your ip adress i get that message, what does it mean?

before slow onboarding ends, could you provide a ready to mine folder with all needed blocks and so on, so everyone can start equally?
since i have some kind of troubles daily, and no solutions in sight, i would appreciate it, thx


[13-Oct-18 03:38 AM] Marcin#0065
and also i dont need to download that mass agains in months snail speed again xD


[13-Oct-18 03:44 AM] tiamat#9131
to see if you are synced or not, open a  browser and check <yourip>:1984


[13-Oct-18 03:44 AM] tiamat#9131
on a different tab, open an ip from the peer list


[13-Oct-18 03:44 AM] tiamat#9131
and compare block heights


[13-Oct-18 03:52 AM] Marcin#0065
i use sams ip only


[13-Oct-18 03:52 AM] Marcin#0065
i think i can trust him to be up to date


[13-Oct-18 03:54 AM] tiamat#9131
you will be connected to more peers anyeay, even if you specify just one in miner, it will query that specific one for more


[13-Oct-18 03:55 AM] Marcin#0065
it cant be that you get outsynced in one day already


[13-Oct-18 03:55 AM] Marcin#0065
i reconnect daily by reloading the command


[13-Oct-18 03:56 AM] Marcin#0065
and already during that day i fired up the command i get block mined which do not show up the same way on the explorer


[13-Oct-18 03:57 AM] Marcin#0065
mining on testnet 2017 was way more less buggy to me than this today to be honest :/


[13-Oct-18 04:00 AM] tiamat#9131
it must be something with your system, is it ubuntu? I don't see any issues following some 3 simple steps: install erlang, grab arweave from github, run the ./arweave-server command


[13-Oct-18 04:00 AM] tiamat#9131
but with polling there could be some lag in getting the latest block


[13-Oct-18 04:02 AM] Marcin#0065
i got a dedicated system for arweave, it always has been since 2017.

i did a complete fresh install of ubuntu with the new hdd i got 2 months ago.

everything works fine, the problems are the outsyncing. at least some auto check up or anything to prevent running a system for long time without even getting alarmed that you mine blocks with higher number than the blockweave has xD


[13-Oct-18 04:03 AM] tiamat#9131
you can not mine higher blocks since the min difficulty enforcing which happened 2 months ago or so


[13-Oct-18 04:04 AM] Marcin#0065
believe mei had blocks with 70-80k already xD


[13-Oct-18 04:04 AM] Marcin#0065
i was wondering for along time, till sam explained me it can be caused by outsyncing and not havin the same diff


[13-Oct-18 04:05 AM] Marcin#0065
afterwards he probably saw a bug in poilling in my error command


[13-Oct-18 04:06 AM] tiamat#9131
what's your current  block height?


[13-Oct-18 04:06 AM] Marcin#0065
what do you mean by "MY" current block height?


[13-Oct-18 04:07 AM] tiamat#9131
the block height of your node


[13-Oct-18 04:08 AM] Marcin#0065

[13-Oct-18 04:09 AM] Marcin#0065

it all looks like im in sync atm, but why the accepted blocks mined by my pc show up under totally different adresses in the explorer is weird to me


[13-Oct-18 04:19 AM] tiamat#9131
maybe because of polling you are not announcing them as fast as needed


[13-Oct-18 04:19 AM] Marcin#0065
that could be


[13-Oct-18 04:20 AM] Marcin#0065
but why stickign that information to ip adresses is a mystery to me still. why not track by ar adresses? you got daily billions of rotations ip adresses, new devices and so on

i shoudl prepare some script for myself to fire up the mining every day in the morning without polling then xD

I guess it's some internal identifier like 127.0.0.1


[13-Oct-18 04:32 AM] Marcin#0065
without polling i do not sync any more. i stay at the block heigh which was newest in the moment


[13-Oct-18 04:43 AM] tiamat#9131
that is because you have some firewall?


[13-Oct-18 04:43 AM] tiamat#9131
either on the router or on the machine itself


[13-Oct-18 04:48 AM] Marcin#0065

[13-Oct-18 05:01 AM] Marcin#0065
i do wonder a bit why Sam has "blocks":76584"

its almost 10k more than current block heigh. how can it come so?


[13-Oct-18 05:05 AM] tiamat#9131
those extra are not valid blocks


[13-Oct-18 05:05 AM] tiamat#9131
they are probably from forks, most likely before the diff enforcement


[13-Oct-18 08:22 AM] Mike#2447
@Marcin Have you considered a static IP VPN as a solution to your problem?  I don't have experience with one, but it might work.


[13-Oct-18 08:28 AM] Marcin#0065
I do not want to pay for it just coz arweave uses this method.


[13-Oct-18 01:39 PM] Marcin#0065
@tiamat  hey, i got a mined block and also in the explorer to see   i guess german internet was fast today and mining stood in sync. 
i needed that, i would quit mining if i had a problem again.

ar_cleanup:rewrite().


[13-Oct-18 02:20 PM] Marcin#0065
have you used the full stop too?


[13-Oct-18 02:21 PM] Marcin#0065
run first:

ar_meta_db:put(disk_logging, true).

so you can see whats going on on the disk in the log.

then run
ar_cleanup:rewrite().


[13-Oct-18 02:25 PM] Vilenarios#8742

thats strange


[13-Oct-18 02:33 PM] Marcin#0065
all i know so far:

firing up the mining command, wait till i see something liek that:

    started_auto_updater
    watch_address: <<"XXXXXXXXXXX

then press enter

then paste command


[13-Oct-18 02:34 PM] Marcin#0065
it worked so far well, but i have thrown my big block away and started freshly with rc1 n1.5 anyway , so pft xD

How profitable is mining? Should I buy a 6 TB hard drive?

[13-Oct-18 02:49 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Is it possible to run multiple miners behind the same public IP address?

[14-Oct-18 01:31 AM] Marcin#0065
vile, maybe you dont have the file from rc1?


[14-Oct-18 01:33 AM] Marcin#0065
in n.1.5.0.0-rc-1 version there are those commands the src folder.

have you checked your src folder for a file which is called: ar_cleanup.erl


[14-Oct-18 01:33 AM] Marcin#0065
?


[14-Oct-18 05:31 AM] Joel#5880
So I've opened the ar_cleanup.erl file in a text editor; there's not too much code in there, however, I have very little programming experience to be able to add a condition into the file. Anyone want a bash? I would say that it would need to be written between line 63 and 79. Logic needs to be: 

"If current block is larger than 200KB, then run the conversion to new format, else skip to next block (in a loop) until it reaches another block that is larger than 200KB."

This would ensure that people still with a lot of old blocks have a better chance of fairer mining with their peers next week.


[14-Oct-18 05:33 AM] Joel#5880
Doesn't have to be 200KB, as new blocks are 1-2KB, 10KB would probably suffice  


[14-Oct-18 06:55 AM] Marcin#0065
More easzier would be to let people download all needed blocks in one quick download.


[14-Oct-18 06:56 AM] Marcin#0065
So everyone can join and not wait weeks before having enough block to be mining most of the time


[14-Oct-18 06:57 AM] Joel#5880
True!


[14-Oct-18 07:33 AM] rehash#3438
On the other hand some people are mining for months without rewards, having the blocks could be like a small reward for them vs new comers, which should wait a week or two to fully onboard.


[14-Oct-18 07:34 AM] rehash#3438
But Marcin, you are one of the most active here, how come you still don't have the blocks?


[14-Oct-18 08:18 AM] Marcin#0065
Im mining since 2017 for arweave. I had a ton of blocks.
But... i got informed few days ago, that i was outsynced since some time. I didnt knew about it all time. So i wiped the whole folder away and let the beta miner run now :)


[14-Oct-18 08:19 AM] Marcin#0065
But i dont care about the blocks, i care about having my cores loaded to produce some warm air during winter, since i heat my room with mining xD
And if i dont have all blocks, the cpu wont start mining that often, and there its cold, which is bad.  :)


[14-Oct-18 08:34 AM] Vilenarios#8742
@arweave-sam will we be able to run multiple miners behind a single public IP? Or is 1984 the only allowable port and I will need to load balance?


[14-Oct-18 10:42 AM] Marcin#0065
there was mentioned the download speed for blocks will be faster too, when will that happend finally?
letting people join the network, but wait 2 weeks at least to have all block finally, is just a really bad idea


[14-Oct-18 10:55 AM] Joel#5880
Lol where do you live @Marcin


[14-Oct-18 11:00 AM] Marcin#0065
what does it matter where i live? :S


[14-Oct-18 11:01 AM] Joel#5880
I'm just curious where it's so cold, that you're using your mining rig for heating  


[14-Oct-18 11:03 AM] Marcin#0065
everyone can do that too. im doing it every winter time   instead of paying heating costs, i just dont use the heater, i let the pc run, and most of the time it returns the costs for heating the room too :D
especially the last winter hype was nice for heating xD


[14-Oct-18 11:04 AM] Joel#5880
Hmm that's a good idea actually!


[14-Oct-18 11:06 AM] Marcin#0065
but i live in a small room, around 20m2. you cant heat up mor ei think with one pc. maybe a full GPU rig could heat more space

[14-Oct-18 09:42 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@Mike We currently expect that 1.5 will become the 'mainline' for mining on or before the mining reward switchover block. I would recommend that you use 1.5-RC-1 for the next few days.


[14-Oct-18 09:42 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Thanks, Marcin, I logged that issue when you mentioned it last week.


[15-Oct-18 12:29 AM] Marcin#0065
thx.

since all mined blocks are dominated by mainly 3-4 Adresses, id ask you to let people download all needed blocks till 65700, when softonboarding ends.
by the given speed which block are downloaded, it takes a  months to be up to date, which is inaceptable. there are a lot people who have been confronted with mining issues like me, even we were connected since 2017. pls consider suchs move


[15-Oct-18 12:33 AM] tiamat#9131
@arweave-sam it seems like the latest update about forks fixed a lot of sync issues    however I was wondering if there is or if there will be a test net where we could do some stress tests?


[15-Oct-18 12:37 AM] Marcin#0065
we had a testnet for a very long time, almost a year


[15-Oct-18 12:38 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We have internal testnets, but not an external one at the moment


[15-Oct-18 12:39 AM] arweave-sam#9630
It might be a good idea to get a public one setup again after 1.5 -- I will talk to the team


[15-Oct-18 12:47 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Also, @Marcin -- I just downloaded 100 blocks from the network between two full 1.5 nodes (transatlantic connection) and at that pace the whole weave would download in 10 hours


[15-Oct-18 12:49 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We will have to re-assess and see where things are after everyone is using 1.5, but if it is not in the order of a few days to download the whole system we can look at some kind of 'snapshot bundling'.


[15-Oct-18 12:53 AM] tiamat#9131
you once said that with 2.0 wallet_lists will get smaller, significantly? could you give a %?


[15-Oct-18 12:59 AM] Marcin#0065
Hey sam. Ive been using rc1 for a complete week almost, got around 20k blocks. Using one peer, which was yours. Pc running 24/7. 
Could there be a portforwarding problem? Ive opened the port 1984 as tcp. Also the miner ist connected to a switch, maybe a direct connection to the router would be besser? Im just looking for possibilites :)


[15-Oct-18 01:55 AM] Joel#5880
@arweave-sam Are you saying that if I run the miner between two different nodes, I should theoretically download the whole weave in around 10 hours?


[15-Oct-18 03:33 AM] codybartfast#9308
@Vilenarios, re running multiple miners on the same address but with different ports, ... I tested this a couple of months back and no, I couldn't use any port other than 1984.   I could bring up the server on a different port by specifying the startup parameter and that part worked fine.  But remote servers just ignored the port you were actually using so I never got responses back from other servers.   I did look at the code and it seemed the server just stored the remote address of peers not remote end-points (the combination of address and port).  Of course it could have been fixed since, but I doubt it's been a priority.


[15-Oct-18 03:44 AM] codybartfast#9308
@Joel, re having ar_cleanup only process larger files,  perhaps open this as a GitHub issue?  This might make a nice easy, low risk job for somebody wanting to make their first contribution to the project.  https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/issues


[15-Oct-18 04:06 AM] Joel#5880
@codybartfast will do, cheers! So I've cloned AGAIN, used @arweave-sam 's peer IP address, which has the lowest latency for me (8550). I'm still downloading blocks every 30 seconds. There's no way I could download the weave in under a month at this rate. Is there something obvious that I'm missing?


[15-Oct-18 04:20 AM] arweave-sam#9630
> you once said that with 2.0 wallet_lists will get smaller, significantly? could you give a %?

@tiamat The plan is that wallet lists older than 50 blocks should be completely optional. So from a space complexity POV we are going from Ospace(n) to Ospace(50).


[15-Oct-18 04:23 AM] arweave-sam#9630
> Of course it could have been fixed since, but I doubt it's been a priority.

Interesting. This *should* work, as when you `POST /peers` on somebody you would like to send data to you in the future, you can specify a port.


[15-Oct-18 04:23 AM] arweave-sam#9630
If it is broken a ticket would be greatly appreciated!  


[15-Oct-18 04:30 AM] arweave-sam#9630
>  Is there something obvious that I'm missing?

Even though you used the IP of a 1.5 node, you will only use that to download the first 50 blocks. After that you use the wider set of nodes that are available to you -- currently including many 1.1 nodes. After the 1.5 release has been deployed we will see how the download times look and go from there.


[15-Oct-18 04:33 AM] tiamat#9131
about port, I see a lot of "1984" in ar_http_iface.erl


[15-Oct-18 04:33 AM] tiamat#9131
maybe that should be replaced with DEFAULT_HTTP_IFACE_PORT ?


[15-Oct-18 04:36 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The references I see in `ar_http_iface` are all in tests which we might want to dissociate from the norm, but definitely a `TEST_HTTP_IFACE_PORT` would be nice

@arweave-sam Thanks again, it is a bit crazy though that since 27th July I have never been at a stage where I have had the whole chain. Ah well, it is what it is. "Smile and wave boys, smile and wave" :p


[15-Oct-18 06:25 AM] Marcin#0065
I have a dream.... that one day... all blocks are downloaded.... ;)
Why not just dump out the old mining and allow rc1.5 or newer? I do not want to connect with peer with older mining version since they slow me down in downloading.
At least a snapshot should be given, otherwise i dont see a point to run behind a months or longer to just keep up with downloading, letting a whole pc system run to be almost all time idle. Come on guys. Maybe someone privately has his arweave folder with most blocks ready for zip?


[15-Oct-18 06:29 AM] Marcin#0065
Is there a way to specify, if an peer uses an older version? And if so, to ignore that peers?


[15-Oct-18 06:31 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Sorry Marcin. I hope your dream turns to reality one day  


[15-Oct-18 06:31 AM] Vilenarios#8742
@codybartfast thanks for the background. Guess I’ll try to play around with it myself and submit a PR if no one else has.


[15-Oct-18 06:53 AM] Vilenarios#8742
@arweave-sam I’m very interested in democratic content policy. Is there more info? How do I access the black list? As miners, how do we see/validate content and actually coordinate the global black list of bad txts? Can content have metadata tags I.e music, pictures, contracts etc?


[15-Oct-18 06:54 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Or who knows maybe as miners we will never decide to black list anything making it fully open...


[15-Oct-18 06:59 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Marcin I could zip up my folder at some point and share if that would help.


[15-Oct-18 07:12 AM] Marcin#0065
Vile, depends on how many blocks you have and if you have the big blocks or the small, new ones.

I think you need not only the block folder, but also the tx folder. But i think the whole "arweave" folder zipped would be the easiest way. 
Im sad that there is no weekly, or monthly snapshot offer by the team itself, since they surely have all blocks.


[15-Oct-18 07:33 AM] tiamat#9131
yes, also very interested in democratic content policy

i quit "mining" (or idling) my pc today for arweave. im sad to leave the project, which i joined over a year ago. But i see it as a waste of energy to see my PC running almost all day in idle doing nothing. i will be back if the mining procedure will mature more. cya soon


[15-Oct-18 08:49 AM] tiamat#9131

Wel there aren’t any rewards anyway. So at least if ur sitting idle ur not wasting energy.

Gpu miners would be better for heating your place anyway. U could mine eth with Gpus and then do arweave with your cpu/disk.


[15-Oct-18 09:09 AM] Mike#2447
@tiamat Do you have the same number of files in your blocks and wallet_lists folders?


[15-Oct-18 09:18 AM] tiamat#9131
yeah, but I think I got the same error when I moved some block files without their wallet_lists pair


[15-Oct-18 09:19 AM] tiamat#9131
Sam said that in the next version(2) this won't be an issue any longer because wallet_lists will have only last 50 blocks


[15-Oct-18 11:00 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hi all, 1.5 RC-2 has now been released.

The key improvement since the RC-1 release is the addition of the `miner's log` on the main console. By default the node will now print to this console when it accepts a foreign block, or you mine a block. This should make it easier for miners to understand what their node is up to, without getting into the 'depths' of the system with the debugging log.


[15-Oct-18 11:00 AM] Mike#2447
Cool!  What is the best way to update?

Git checkout N.1.5.0-RC-2 didn't work for me, I had to do N.1.5.0.0-RC-2 for anyone with same problem. Do we need to do anything for the new logging to start displaying?


[15-Oct-18 11:19 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Ah, thanks Joel


[15-Oct-18 11:19 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I will edit my post


[15-Oct-18 11:20 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The miner logging should be automatically enabled


[15-Oct-18 11:20 AM] arweave-sam#9630
But won't start until after you have joined (downloaded the last 50 blocks)


[15-Oct-18 11:28 AM] Marcin#0065
will there be a snapshot provided after all the questions?


[15-Oct-18 11:29 AM] Marcin#0065
its fair to all the people who want to join

also not nice to see 4 adresses domination all mining calculation so far in the last weeks


[15-Oct-18 11:31 AM] Joel#5880
I guess you can't help that some people are mining with high spec. hardware. GIGO  


[15-Oct-18 11:35 AM] Marcin#0065
high spec hardware will help you only with few people in the circle, it gets unimportant when more people join. also cpu hash rate aint the only key to get rewarded, its just one of many and not even the highest priority. 
what i do not understand how you possibly can reach people by saying: "come join the network, let your pc run for 1 month untill you have all blocks, then ur in"


[15-Oct-18 11:36 AM] Marcin#0065
ofc, you can try to multiply many cpus into one adress, but the scaling is always present. im talking about the "normal one pc miner at home" scenario


[15-Oct-18 11:42 AM] Joel#5880
I'm back to only having 30,000 after re-cloning. But I figure I have more blocks than someone mining from today. Yeah, but you get out what you put in. When you actually think about it. If this was a fully functioning product; thousands of people archiving hundreds of MB's of data every minute. You would need macho miners with their high spec. hardware to cope with demand. The lonely single PC miner at home, is still contributing, albeit a small amount. He will get out what he puts in, I guess. In your case, heating your room and getting a few AR in the process  


[15-Oct-18 11:43 AM] Marcin#0065
following your idea, we can just join dropbox and amazon strait away?


[15-Oct-18 11:44 AM] Marcin#0065
if we are here for profit only, i think we are in the wrong place in the first place


[15-Oct-18 12:08 PM] arweave-sam#9630
> will there be a snapshot provided after all the questions?

Hey Marcin, I hear your position on this one, but as stated earlier we will see what the block downloading speed is like post-1.5. There is every reason to believe that will dramatically improve the speed, as noted from my experiment earlier.


[15-Oct-18 12:09 PM] Marcin#0065
but tell me the reason, why not allowing the people to downlaod a simple zipped folder?


[15-Oct-18 12:10 PM] Marcin#0065
which containd rc2 already


[15-Oct-18 12:45 PM] Mike#2447
@arweave-sam The new feature seems to be working.   


[15-Oct-18 01:47 PM] tiamat#9131
good to see you back Marcin  


[15-Oct-18 01:48 PM] Joel#5880
☺️


[15-Oct-18 01:52 PM] Joel#5880
I just co-mined my first block... Only had .01 AR for it though. What's the explorer url again?


[15-Oct-18 01:52 PM] tiamat#9131
viewblock.io/arweave


[15-Oct-18 01:52 PM] Joel#5880
Thanks


[15-Oct-18 05:45 PM] patrick#8648
@Marcin  i only have about 13K blocks, I can put it up for someone to download, but it's hardly close to the 64k there are now


[15-Oct-18 11:20 PM] NewbieFT#9201
I came back to try mining but geez the downloading of blocks is still the killer


[15-Oct-18 11:20 PM] NewbieFT#9201
so slow


[15-Oct-18 11:29 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Congrats @Joel !


[15-Oct-18 11:30 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@NewbieFT Yep, the block downloading will be quite slow until the network adopts 1.5 properly. Should only be a few days now.


[15-Oct-18 11:37 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@Marcin As well as the fact that we expect the issue will resolve itself in a few days, the main concern I have is this:

Data distribution in the Arweave network is incentivised. If we (the Arweave project) get involved with producing and distributing blocks off-weave we could inadvertently tip the scales for miners in ways that we have tried very hard to avoid. I am happy to be pragmatic about it if we find that 1.5 does not sufficiently solve the block download problem, but until then I ask for your patience. Thanks.


[16-Oct-18 01:19 AM] Vilenarios#8742
In the latest release you only need last 50 blocks right?


[16-Oct-18 01:20 AM] tiamat#9131
you will never need only 50 blocks, you will always be asked for a recall block if you want to mine


[16-Oct-18 01:23 AM] tiamat#9131
and yeah, since recall block is a condition of mining, I don't think it's in the decentralization spirit, not fair if the team would get involved in spreading zipped blocks, all they should do is to improve block distribution


[16-Oct-18 01:23 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Very good point.


[16-Oct-18 01:23 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Plus at some point this zip file would be veeeeeery large


[16-Oct-18 01:24 AM] tiamat#9131
we are lucky to have direct communication with the team, very few projects have this, so I don't think it's wise to put pressure


[16-Oct-18 01:24 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I wonder... will data be compressed or deduplicated on the blockweave?


[16-Oct-18 01:26 AM] tiamat#9131
you mean deduplicated between nodes, like sharding? probably only hosted files


[16-Oct-18 01:26 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Hmm yeah I guess I’m not sure what I mean exactly. Just trying to think of storage saving methods


[16-Oct-18 01:27 AM] tiamat#9131
if wallet_lists will contain only last 50 blocks in version 2, and since we already have tiny blocks, the data will be much smaller, but the stored files should grow


[16-Oct-18 01:28 AM] tiamat#9131
and at that point, each miner will choose what to keep


[16-Oct-18 01:28 AM] tiamat#9131
btw, version 2 is not RC2, we are still on 1.5


[16-Oct-18 01:29 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I guess blockshadows are similar to a dedup


[16-Oct-18 01:33 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Dedup/compression is an interesting one.

The approach we have gone with is essentially: It is down to the user to decide what is worth storing (even if their file is a duplicate), and it is also the user's responsibility to efficiently compress their data.


[16-Oct-18 01:33 AM] arweave-sam#9630
They just pay for what they use


[16-Oct-18 01:33 AM] Vilenarios#8742
True. I guess compression could be a function of the dapp (or regular app) being built.


[16-Oct-18 01:33 AM] Vilenarios#8742
So they pay less cuz a smaller file


[16-Oct-18 01:34 AM] arweave-sam#9630
This also opens up another avenue of competition between miners in the later stages -- making the most of their storage space by finding efficient compression mechanisms for their data


[16-Oct-18 01:35 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Ah yes. I’ll setup my miner with a 3par storage array.


[16-Oct-18 01:35 AM] Vilenarios#8742
 


[16-Oct-18 01:35 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Sam I really appreciate your response. As Tiamat said, we are lucky to have such close interaction with the team.


[16-Oct-18 01:37 AM] arweave-sam#9630
No problem at all! As the founder of the project it is extremely exciting to see people getting involved

[16-Oct-18 01:37 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I could chat here all day  


[16-Oct-18 01:38 AM] Vilenarios#8742
So regardless of the file uploaded to the weave, it’s represented as a json?


[16-Oct-18 01:38 AM] arweave-sam#9630
At the moment, but that will change quite soon


[16-Oct-18 01:39 AM] Joel#5880
So I've mined a few blocks over night, but can't see any of them on the block explorer...


[16-Oct-18 01:39 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I am not sure where it will fit on the timeline because we would like to replace all of the JSON disk stuff with a nicer database backend.


[16-Oct-18 01:39 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Change as in, if a gif is uploaded, I will see a gif in my blocks folder?


[16-Oct-18 01:40 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Nope


[16-Oct-18 01:40 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Ah right I see what you are saying, like a mdl sql database file


[16-Oct-18 01:40 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We won't let the user write data in its final representation onto miner's disks


[16-Oct-18 01:41 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We haven't decided on the exact architecture yet


[16-Oct-18 01:41 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Sounds complex... so miners won’t ever really know what the content is


[16-Oct-18 01:41 AM] arweave-sam#9630
They will be able to decode it


[16-Oct-18 01:41 AM] arweave-sam#9630
If they want to


[16-Oct-18 01:42 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The important thing though is that a malicious user won't be able to write malware onto the disks of miners  


[16-Oct-18 01:42 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Haha yeah good point. Or so we hope  


[16-Oct-18 01:42 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We build so as not to have to hope  


[16-Oct-18 01:43 AM] arweave-sam#9630
...hopefully


[16-Oct-18 01:43 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Haha


[16-Oct-18 01:44 AM] Vilenarios#8742
It’d be a good test though...


[16-Oct-18 01:44 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Pen test the hell out of it. Better find vulnerabilities on purpose.


[16-Oct-18 01:44 AM] tiamat#9131
It's very important if things work well on the protocol layer so to speak, how files look on disk is not that important, like you said, miners could change the way they are at some point.


[16-Oct-18 01:44 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep


[16-Oct-18 01:45 AM] arweave-sam#9630
At some point it would be nice (and I expect we might be pushed) to support 'pluggable' backends for the storage


[16-Oct-18 01:45 AM] arweave-sam#9630
So people can implement their own engines for it


[16-Oct-18 01:46 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Similar to community built miners for PoW cryptocurriences


[16-Oct-18 01:47 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Just need to intercept all the requests to the node and store/retrieve the data the way you want. As if that’s so easy to code...


[16-Oct-18 01:47 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hahaha


[16-Oct-18 01:48 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We will make an easy interface to interact with  


[16-Oct-18 01:48 AM] Vilenarios#8742
But yeah you could write to any traditional dB at that point.


[16-Oct-18 01:48 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Should just be a case of 

GET tx
POST tx
GET block
POST block


[16-Oct-18 01:48 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Exactly


[16-Oct-18 01:48 AM] tiamat#9131
yeah, in the later stages I'd probably like to keep files which are not often accessed in a big slow hdd, while the high traffic data would be on ssds


[16-Oct-18 01:49 AM] arweave-sam#9630
That would be very neat


[16-Oct-18 01:49 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Most enterprise SANS do that automatically


[16-Oct-18 01:49 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Could even use ... tapes(???) for the very low utilisation stuff


[16-Oct-18 01:50 AM] Vilenarios#8742
SSD won’t benefit the blockweave I don’t think though.


[16-Oct-18 01:50 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Not at the beggining


[16-Oct-18 01:50 AM] arweave-sam#9630
It is all relevant to the competition in the rest of the network


[16-Oct-18 01:51 AM] Vilenarios#8742
So many goddamn variables!


[16-Oct-18 01:51 AM] Vilenarios#8742
It’s not like “buy gpu x”


[16-Oct-18 01:51 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Makes this so much more interesting imo


[16-Oct-18 01:53 AM] tiamat#9131
I'm very excited by this project because the value is directly linked in the coins. For instance Ethereum is a great project, but you can run smart contracts and use the network at highest potential with only a tiny amount of ETH.


[16-Oct-18 01:54 AM] tiamat#9131
with AR if you have only a tiny amount, you won't be able to store much, so you will need more


[16-Oct-18 01:54 AM] tiamat#9131
however, it will be a challenge to keep it well balanced


[16-Oct-18 01:56 AM] Vilenarios#8742
What’s the current AR/Mb rate?


[16-Oct-18 01:59 AM] yemboy#6783
How long does it take for a new node starting mining now to hit present height?


[16-Oct-18 01:59 AM] yemboy#6783
Present block height


[16-Oct-18 02:45 AM] Andy T#3460
Hi mates!


[16-Oct-18 02:45 AM] codybartfast#9308
@Joel  I hope some of your mined blocks made it to the block explorer.  Only about half the blocks I mine survive.  I think it's quite common for two mines to mine a block at approximately the same time and ultimately only one will be chosen by the network,  if you lose the 'vote' then I think you'll see a fork recovery process kick off as your miner incorporates the other block.  I think the flip side of this is the "ignoring_block_below_current" message which is  when  somebody else has mined a block and you ignore it because you've already got a block from another mine.

@yemboy   the  height shown on you the info page of your mine (127.0.0.1:1984/info) should match the network quite quickly, e.g. a couple of minutes  after you download the 50 latest blocks.   If it doesn't, it may mean you have a network/firewall issue.   As for how long it will take to download all those blocks, that's a subject of some discussion above (I don't know I've not had to do it for long time).


[16-Oct-18 03:17 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep, I am going to add joining progress reports to the `miner_logging` feature today so that this is clearer


[16-Oct-18 03:37 AM] yemboy#6783
@codybartfast my Miner still N.1 and I tried git checkout N.1.5.0.0-RC-2 but not updating or how do I run it? Thanks


[16-Oct-18 03:51 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hi @yemboy


[16-Oct-18 03:51 AM] arweave-sam#9630
What output do you get when you try to checkout the new version?


[16-Oct-18 04:01 AM] yemboy#6783
I reinstall the Miner ..am getting head is now at 208342e. Is this correct?


[16-Oct-18 04:02 AM] yemboy#6783
Out of 127.0.0.1:1984 gives version:3,release:9..is this okay?


[16-Oct-18 04:10 AM] yemboy#6783
@arweave-samam seeing my network as N.1, version: 3, release:9


[16-Oct-18 05:15 AM] arweave-sam#9630
That looks good!


[16-Oct-18 05:15 AM] arweave-sam#9630
release 9 is 1.5-RC-2


[16-Oct-18 05:44 AM] yemboy#6783
@arweave-sam okay thanks. What will be the reward per block from height 65700?


[16-Oct-18 05:44 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The reward decreases for every block, but in the first year 5.5m AR will be released, 2.25m AR the year after that, etc


[16-Oct-18 05:56 AM] Mike#2447
I recall finding the rewards formula in the code a while back, but when I tried to find it again the other day I couldn't remember where it was.


[16-Oct-18 06:58 AM] yemboy#6783
@arweave-sam do you have to synch the whole 64800 block so far before your node can start to mine?


[16-Oct-18 06:58 AM] yemboy#6783
Download


[16-Oct-18 07:19 AM] Mike#2447
No, only the last 50.  However you will need as many of the older blocks as possible to maximize your mining potential.


[16-Oct-18 07:38 AM] yemboy#6783
Thanks


[16-Oct-18 08:17 AM] ivhturp#3325
Hi


[16-Oct-18 08:18 AM] ivhturp#3325
what is a decent benchmark score? And where to find the current total hash power being used ?


[16-Oct-18 08:19 AM] ivhturp#3325
https://viewblock.io/arweave doesnt seem to show the info w.r.t this


[16-Oct-18 08:59 AM] tiamat#9131
It seems like the number of miners is growing


[16-Oct-18 08:59 AM] tiamat#9131
100+ already


[16-Oct-18 10:26 AM] yemboy#6783
@Mike how do I know if it's mining? Am seeing accepted foreign block nusxxxxxx on my terminal..is that okay?


[16-Oct-18 10:26 AM] yemboy#6783
@Mike if it's mining


[16-Oct-18 10:28 AM] Mike#2447
That sounds correct.


[16-Oct-18 10:28 AM] Mike#2447
You can open a second terminal in your arweave folder and enter 'make log' to see additional info.  You should see something like this:
=INFO REPORT==== 16-Oct-2018::11:27:43 ===
    node_starting_miner: <0.843.0>
    recall_block: 59956

=INFO REPORT==== 16-Oct-2018::11:27:44 ===
    node: <0.843.0>
    started_miner: <0.23313.0>


[16-Oct-18 10:30 AM] Mike#2447
I also have a monitor to indicate CPU usage.  When it sits around 100%, I know it's mining.


[16-Oct-18 10:32 AM] yemboy#6783
Okay thanks...seen


[16-Oct-18 10:32 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep, @yemboy -- looks good!


[16-Oct-18 10:32 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@tiamat `app_net_explore:get_live_nodes()` gave me 81 a moment ago


[16-Oct-18 10:33 AM] arweave-sam#9630
But yep, certainly increasing!


[16-Oct-18 10:47 AM] yemboy#6783
@arweave-sam closing terminal = shutting down Miner?


[16-Oct-18 10:58 AM] arweave-india#5075
@yemboy I think there is a way to continue the miner running if you close the window- as taken from our mining guide FAQ section "We recommend starting the miner in a screen session, you can then safely disconnect from the screen session and close your terminal with the miner still running."


[16-Oct-18 11:01 AM] yemboy#6783
@arweave-india yes, just read it but what command do I use to disconnect without shutting Down the mining session..sorry


[16-Oct-18 11:02 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hi @yemboy


[16-Oct-18 11:02 AM] arweave-sam#9630
If you run `screen`


[16-Oct-18 11:02 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Then execute your Arweave join command


[16-Oct-18 11:03 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Then press `Ctrl+a` followed by `d`

You will be able to shut the terminal


[16-Oct-18 11:03 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Then to get back to it simply run `screen -rd`

@arweave-sam thanks..will try it out now


[16-Oct-18 11:16 AM] Joel#5880
So if I want to archive a web page using the Chrome addon, I would need to pay the fee, which would then be queued for mining and then be available on the weave?


[16-Oct-18 11:45 AM] kaifovo#8334
is there a guide on how to setup miner ?


[16-Oct-18 12:00 PM] Dentechr#5213
you can receive it if you are in the mailing list


[16-Oct-18 12:00 PM] arweave-india#5075
Yep I can email you a copy now if you want @kaifovo ? Just drop me a PM with your email address and I'll send you the latest version


[16-Oct-18 12:01 PM] arweave-india#5075
@Joel Yes, that's right! That's what I do daily  


[16-Oct-18 12:02 PM] rg#6034
@arweave-india  can i PM you for a copy of the guide as well?


[16-Oct-18 12:02 PM] Joel#5880
@arweave-india Haha, I'm sure you do, but I'm sure you have a lot of AR to help you do it  


[16-Oct-18 12:03 PM] arweave-india#5075
@rg Of course, everyone's welcome to do so if they want  


[16-Oct-18 12:04 PM] arweave-india#5075
@Joel It's true - I can use some of the project's AR tokens to archive things onto the weave


[16-Oct-18 12:06 PM] Joel#5880
Silly question maybe, but I assume everything on the weave is transparent? So if I wanted to archive something private, the arweave isn't the place to do it?


[16-Oct-18 12:06 PM] patrick#8648
encrypt it


[16-Oct-18 12:06 PM] arweave-india#5075
You can archive something you've encrypted - patrick's right


[16-Oct-18 12:07 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Ya put it in an encrypted zip file or something


[16-Oct-18 12:08 PM] Joel#5880
I see, but currently, with the Chrome addon, you couldn't encrypt say my bank statement web page?


[16-Oct-18 12:08 PM] arweave-india#5075
Yes - the extension doesn't auto-encrypt anything


[16-Oct-18 12:08 PM] Joel#5880
Ok cool, thanks ☺️

Try a different IP address. If you don't have many blocks, then I wouldn't worry about the error, as it just means you don't have the recall block - I think :p

[16-Oct-18 12:58 PM] flamesx#4524
Hi Sam, should I restart the mining to get more block or just leave it running?


[16-Oct-18 12:59 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Working on a Windows 2016 server core miner. Will share my hash rate when it’s all done.


[16-Oct-18 01:31 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Nice @Vilenarios !


[16-Oct-18 01:31 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Just leave it running @flamesx


[16-Oct-18 01:58 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Hmm... I can get to my 1984/info page from my server itself, and the miner is all joined with no issues, but I can’t connect to 1984/info via my servers public Ip


[16-Oct-18 01:59 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Sounds like a port forwarding issue?

is there an example of what i should see (to know i'm doing things right setting up the miner)

@Vilenarios Amazing!

@rg Which version are you running?

ubuntu in windows subsystem


[16-Oct-18 02:04 PM] arweave-sam#9630
If you have followed the instructions in the recent mining email you should not see any output on the console for about 15 minutes then you will start to see 'accepted foreign block' messages


[16-Oct-18 02:04 PM] arweave-sam#9630
This indicates that you have joined the weave successfully


[16-Oct-18 02:05 PM] arweave-sam#9630
You can open another terminal in the Arweave directory and run `make log` to see a more detailed view of what your node is doing


[16-Oct-18 02:10 PM] rg#6034
ah it's syncing blocks


[16-Oct-18 02:11 PM] Ivan#5016
Hello, Community! I need some help, please. I have installed Arweave server on my dev/sda1 = A. Also I have a two disks for storage (dev/sdb1 = B and dev/sdc1 = C). Can I store Aweave blocks on disks B and C? If yes, how can I do it?


[16-Oct-18 02:14 PM] tiamat#9131
@Ivan  a quick fix would be to use symbolic links, like for sdb1 blocks + wallet_lists and the hosted files on sdc1, but for something more advance you would have to write a solution yourself at this point


[16-Oct-18 02:16 PM] Joel#5880
My bad, thought you meant run Ubuntu on one disk and store Arweave blocks etc on another


[16-Oct-18 02:17 PM] Ivan#5016
@Joel, no-no, all works on Ubuntu.


[16-Oct-18 02:20 PM] Ivan#5016
Okay, got it. So, I will use symbolic links. However, I can only use one of the two disks.

@arweave-sam  I have same issue @flamesx ," could_not_start_mining ,stored_recall_block_for_foreign_verification" but i see that log is not updated afer this message( 2 hours ago). How can i know if server is working?


[16-Oct-18 02:25 PM] Joel#5880
@Pacobits | stakely.io on the miner window, hit enter so you get Erlang terminal, which will look like this:

Please can you run `rm ebin/*` in your arweave directory, then retry?


[19-Oct-18 11:57 AM] patrick#8648
ok i changed my command to have only one peer (sam) and it's woirking now


[19-Oct-18 11:57 AM] patrick#8648
before i was getting weird errors, i think i had old peers that had bad blocks


[19-Oct-18 11:57 AM] patrick#8648
now joining the network takes 100 blocks, any particualr reason?


[19-Oct-18 11:58 AM] ATLAS#7218
I'm still stuck :(


[19-Oct-18 11:58 AM] arweave-sam#9630
This would be my recommended peer list:

`./arweave-server peer 52.56.119.91 peer 34.216.88.202 peer 54.93.54.173 peer 18.130.126.49 peer 13.231.142.3 peer 18.179.119.203 peer 54.159.24.25 peer 54.175.114.204 mine`


[19-Oct-18 11:58 AM] ATLAS#7218
Is there any way to see more detailed log?


[19-Oct-18 11:59 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Sometimes getting started joining the net can be slow if you have offline peers on your list


[19-Oct-18 11:59 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@baz `make log`


[19-Oct-18 11:59 AM] Vilenarios#8742
So how do i continually have the best list of peers?


[19-Oct-18 11:59 AM] ATLAS#7218
Yeah I am using make log.


[19-Oct-18 12:00 PM] Vilenarios#8742
i guess i could add my own peers to my own list as well...


[19-Oct-18 12:00 PM] arweave-sam#9630
You could indeed


[19-Oct-18 12:00 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Im still conflicted on how to get multi-node, single punblic ip to work


[19-Oct-18 12:00 PM] ATLAS#7218
Do I have to give peers as argument every time I start the server?


[19-Oct-18 12:01 PM] arweave-sam#9630
baz, you can also add `enable disk_logging enable http_logging` to the command line


[19-Oct-18 12:01 PM] arweave-sam#9630
You do indeed


[19-Oct-18 12:01 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Ah


[19-Oct-18 12:01 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Did you omit a `peer xxx` from the command line? That won't join the network


[19-Oct-18 12:01 PM] ATLAS#7218
No i didnt


[19-Oct-18 12:01 PM] ATLAS#7218
just curious


[19-Oct-18 12:02 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We don't offer default peers because with Arweave you _trust_ those peers while joining


[19-Oct-18 12:02 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Having a default peer list would lead to centralisation


[19-Oct-18 12:02 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I see


[19-Oct-18 12:06 PM] ATLAS#7218
I used the previous peers I got from email and that was the reason it seems


[19-Oct-18 12:06 PM] ATLAS#7218
I ran with your recommended peer and it joined in a sec


[19-Oct-18 12:07 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Ah ok


[19-Oct-18 12:07 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Interesting


[19-Oct-18 12:08 PM] arweave-sam#9630
So with the very long list of peers it will try and time sync you with every node


[19-Oct-18 12:08 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Which would take a very long time, given some of the nodes have since gone offline (meaning you will wait for the timeout).


[19-Oct-18 12:08 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Thanks for bringing this up, I will write a ticket.


[19-Oct-18 12:09 PM] ATLAS#7218
I gave only 6 peers tho


[19-Oct-18 12:09 PM] ATLAS#7218
./arweave-server peer 35.178.129.36 peer 18.130.126.49 peer 52.56.119.91 peer 52.33.231.154  peer 34.216.88.202 peer 54.159.24.25 mine


[19-Oct-18 12:10 PM] ATLAS#7218
was the command I've used


[19-Oct-18 12:10 PM] tiamat#9131
original list was a NO for me also, but with this it joined in no time


[19-Oct-18 12:11 PM] ATLAS#7218
Holy sh*t. Its writing 16 blocks per sec. Damn


[19-Oct-18 12:11 PM] ATLAS#7218
This is some huge improvement


[19-Oct-18 12:12 PM] arweave-sam#9630
 


[19-Oct-18 12:12 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Is that during the joining period (initial 100 blocks), or after?


[19-Oct-18 12:12 PM] ATLAS#7218
initial 100


[19-Oct-18 12:13 PM] Marcin#0065
still stuck xD


[19-Oct-18 12:13 PM] ATLAS#7218

[19-Oct-18 12:15 PM] Marcin#0065
it all showed up at once the momenti aborted the miner in terminal xD


[19-Oct-18 12:15 PM] Marcin#0065
its way longer, but i cant paste so much here


[19-Oct-18 12:16 PM] arweave-sam#9630
The sending block and tx, scanned_object, and joining messages all seem normal


[19-Oct-18 12:16 PM] Marcin#0065
okay cool


[19-Oct-18 12:16 PM] Marcin#0065
so i think its working


[19-Oct-18 12:16 PM] Marcin#0065
but the speed hasnt increased much still  


[19-Oct-18 12:18 PM] arweave-sam#9630
> Holy sh*t. Its writing 16 blocks per sec. Damn


[19-Oct-18 12:18 PM] arweave-sam#9630
You are not seeing an increase in speed?


[19-Oct-18 12:18 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@Marcin


[19-Oct-18 12:18 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Please can you let me know your average per hour download rate after the initial join is complete, Marcin?


[19-Oct-18 12:19 PM] Marcin#0065
i get one block in 1 minute?


[19-Oct-18 12:19 PM] Marcin#0065
okay i will test later the speed


[19-Oct-18 12:21 PM] arweave-sam#9630

Ah I see


[19-Oct-18 12:37 PM] arweave-sam#9630
So @baz was getting 16 blocks per second on those nodes, and you got 6.25 blocks per minute


[19-Oct-18 12:37 PM] Mike#2447
I would say that is about the same speed I saw before.

That is very interesting


[19-Oct-18 12:41 PM] Mike#2447
Typically the two ISP networks are comparable in speed.  So I agree, that is interesting.

Mike please can you try on the slow connection with just the first peer?

I started a brand new WSL instance and Arweave installation and this is what I got.  Almost 40 minutes to join.  Perhaps overall compute ability has something to do with the download time?  This installation is running in the background of a computer I'm already working on.  I also ran speedtest.net and came back with a 31 ms ping and 26.31 Mbps download speed.

Could just be coincidence, but I haven't found a block since moving to RC3.  Previously I was finding a few blocks per hour.  Has anyone else had block finding issues?

[19-Oct-18 09:56 PM] ATLAS#7218
In the lightpaper, discussion about storage pool is a bit off. It says that if such pools exist, incentive to store rare blocks increase by others. But in such case, how do you determine the rarity of a block.


[19-Oct-18 09:59 PM] ATLAS#7218
@arweave-sam as we've discussed before there is no network-wide instance counting, but even if that's implemented the blocks in storage pool will be accessed by number of nodes, and hence, appear popular instead of rare.


[19-Oct-18 10:01 PM] ATLAS#7218
Also, when I don't have the recall block, I retrieve it but then why doesn't it try to start miner again?


[19-Oct-18 10:05 PM] ATLAS#7218
It is only used to verify the new block if I understood correctly. Is there any particular reason that it doesn't try to start mining?


[19-Oct-18 10:07 PM] ATLAS#7218
Another question, after downloading the first 100, does it only retrieve recall block and new block? Is there a way to force download every block?

My account has not had any tx out. And it's "missing" AR which was mined at least 8+ hours ago.


[19-Oct-18 11:13 PM] patrick#8648
Which the only explanation for me is a powerful miner making their own history and then merging it to the main network


[19-Oct-18 11:13 PM] patrick#8648
Which means bravo miner but at the same time makes it vulnerable to attack.

any idea why my "log terminal" is not updating itself with the new entries? when i abourt the mining i get all log reports at once. but its not showing live whats going on. any idea how it works in ubuntu wsl ?

[20-Oct-18 05:43 AM] Dentechr#5213
@Mike I found a block on rc3. Just one so far


[20-Oct-18 05:43 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@Dentechr That will be because you are running a powerful miner but are in `polling` mode


[20-Oct-18 05:44 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You need to have port forwarding and firewall rules setup correctly in order to properly keep in sync with the network


[20-Oct-18 05:45 AM] arweave-sam#9630
If other nodes can't notify you of new blocks, you will spend time mining on your own fork


[20-Oct-18 05:47 AM] Dentechr#5213
@arweave-sam So my port forwarding is still not working properly?


[20-Oct-18 05:48 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I still cannot access port 1984 at the address you provided me with yesterday


[20-Oct-18 05:48 AM] Mike#2447
I ended up mining a few blocks overnight, so it seems my concerns were invalid.


[20-Oct-18 05:48 AM] Dentechr#5213
Hmm that a strange. I forwarded that port and put firewall to low


[20-Oct-18 05:50 AM] Dentechr#5213
Let me just try some things again and I will ask you to check it again if that is oke


[20-Oct-18 05:54 AM] ATLAS#7218
@arweave-sam can you answer my questions above?


[20-Oct-18 05:55 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@Dentechr You should be able to test it yourself by attempting to access http://[your external ip]:1984 in your browser


[20-Oct-18 05:55 AM] Joel#5880
Why does my upvest wallet not reflect http://127.0.0.1 balance?


[20-Oct-18 06:01 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I am not sure that the Upvest wallet will show your mining rewards in real time. Because of the way they have engineered their system. As I understand it, it will always resync the balance that it shows to you to the network eventually, but it might take a while.


[20-Oct-18 06:01 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The web extension wallet would be a better choice for miners at this stage.


[20-Oct-18 06:03 AM] Joel#5880
Cool fair enough  


[20-Oct-18 06:11 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@baz: I am afraid that I do not have time to go into the details today, but here is a quick answer: This is an off-net affair. In a theoretical situation in which mining pools have become common, miners would socially be able to see this (in the same way we all have awareness of the existence of Bitcoin pools by people using and talking about them), and the effect that it has on the weave. If a number of pools then shut down, we could see that blocks are becoming rarer again and subsequently the incentive to store them increases.


[20-Oct-18 06:26 AM] Dentechr#5213
@arweave-sam could you try it one more time ? i think it was my firewall


[20-Oct-18 06:27 AM] arweave-sam#9630

In the literal sense that their are no blocks in your `blocks` folder, or you are not seeing the `block_written_to_disk` message anymore?


[20-Oct-18 06:48 AM] cromulon#5411
both


[20-Oct-18 06:48 AM] cromulon#5411
i haven't seen "block_written_to_disk"


[20-Oct-18 06:50 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We disabled those messages by default a while ago, as there were too many


[20-Oct-18 06:50 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You can re-enable them if you like using `enable disk_logging` on the command line


[20-Oct-18 06:50 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Or even `ar_meta_db:put(disk_logging, true).` on the Arweave console of a running node.


[20-Oct-18 07:14 AM] yemboy#6783
@arweave-sam like how many blocks do you need to have before stop seeing could_not_start_mining?

The proportion of time that you see that message is (probabilistically) equal to the proportion of the total number of blocks that you have.


[20-Oct-18 07:27 AM] yemboy#6783
@arweave-sam I still have a long way to..just have about 3111 now


[20-Oct-18 07:27 AM] arweave-sam#9630
What version are you running, @yemboy?


[20-Oct-18 07:29 AM] yemboy#6783
@arweave-sam RC-3B.. started mining 7pm gmt yesterday evening...I guess it will be like 6000 - 7000 per day at this rate.. probably have all downloaded in next 10 - 12 days


[20-Oct-18 07:30 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Sounds about right, there is a comparatively large number of nodes downloading the weave right now


[20-Oct-18 07:30 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Many people joined just before the rewards kicked in and still need to get the first 65k blocks


[20-Oct-18 07:34 AM] yemboy#6783
@arweave-sam will the speed / rate of download increase over time because future miners yet to join can get discouraged if they realise they have to use 1 month or more to download before they can start mining  or will there be a way to download from present miners?


[20-Oct-18 07:35 AM] yemboy#6783
I guess present miners can decide to trade that as well..trade their arweave downloaded block to new miners


[20-Oct-18 07:37 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The speed has improved and will continue to do so. The bottleneck now is that there is a comparatively small group of nodes with all the blocks, and many nodes attempting to get them.


[20-Oct-18 07:38 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Once the net 'levels out' a bit, the weight of new miners joining the net will be split across a larger group, so the speed will be faster.


[20-Oct-18 07:38 AM] Vilenarios#8742
And aren’t the big blocks still getting converted to small blocks?


[20-Oct-18 07:39 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Indeed


[20-Oct-18 07:39 AM] arweave-sam#9630
There are still a bunch of nodes serving the old format


[20-Oct-18 07:39 AM] arweave-sam#9630
But that will slowly fade over time


[20-Oct-18 07:40 AM] Vilenarios#8742
And Sam you don’t see any issues continually merging blocks/txs/wallet_lists across nodes right?


[20-Oct-18 07:41 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Without overwrite. So it only copies new unique blocks


[20-Oct-18 07:43 AM] arweave-sam#9630
That should be fine, just as long as the permissions are maintained


[20-Oct-18 07:43 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Roger that.


[20-Oct-18 07:44 AM] arweave-sam#9630
And that you don't end up with some blocks whose wallet list did not copy correctly, etc


[20-Oct-18 07:44 AM] Vilenarios#8742
If that ever happens I can selectively delete the wallet list/block right


[20-Oct-18 07:45 AM] arweave-sam#9630
That will happen automatically


[20-Oct-18 07:45 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Even better.


[20-Oct-18 07:45 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The block will be moved to the 'blocks/invalid' directory


[20-Oct-18 07:46 AM] arweave-sam#9630
And you will see a 'wallet list not found' (or similar) message in the logs


[20-Oct-18 07:47 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I still haven’t done a load balancer yet... will attempt that later. Hoping I can use Windows NLB


[20-Oct-18 07:49 AM] Mike#2447
So the wallet list not found message is not a bad thing?


[20-Oct-18 07:52 AM] arweave-sam#9630
It means that at some point you didn't write a WL for a block that you stored, but it can be safely ignored


[20-Oct-18 07:53 AM] tiamat#9131
hmm... I think I was not able to mine blocks for which I did not have the WL


[20-Oct-18 07:53 AM] tiamat#9131
recall


[20-Oct-18 07:53 AM] Mike#2447
No impact on mining or network communications?


[20-Oct-18 07:56 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Indeed -- if you do not have the wallet list, you essentially don't have the block so you can't mine*


[20-Oct-18 07:56 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You will redownload these blocks naturally over time though


[20-Oct-18 07:57 AM] arweave-sam#9630
*Until 2.0, when storing wallet lists older than 50 blocks will become optional.


[20-Oct-18 07:58 AM] Vilenarios#8742
So would there be an issue having multiple nodes load balanced behind a single public vIP?


[20-Oct-18 07:58 AM] Mike#2447
Should all peers have identical wallet lists?


[20-Oct-18 07:59 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@Vilenarios This is interesting, I am not sure anyone has tried it in practice.


[20-Oct-18 08:00 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You will need all of the nodes behind the public IP to receive `POST /block` requests


[20-Oct-18 08:00 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Which an LB would not do by default


[20-Oct-18 08:01 AM] Vilenarios#8742
They would be able to but the sessions that other nodes initiative may not have session affinity


[20-Oct-18 08:01 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Hmm so I guess it may not be poissble to run multiple miners at home then  


[20-Oct-18 08:02 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@Mike They just need to have the WLs for the blocks that they hold. As they can hold different sets of blocks, they don't need to all have the same set of WLs.


[20-Oct-18 08:02 AM] tiamat#9131
you should run on different ports, that there might be some small issues with that that need to be fixed


[20-Oct-18 08:03 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@Vilenarios If you are feeling adventurous you could try setting up a Distributed Erlang session with multiple miners and an internal network


[20-Oct-18 08:03 AM] Mike#2447
Ideally though if you have all the blocks, you want all the wl on all machines.


[20-Oct-18 08:03 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Nobody has done this yet, but it is how we see big farms being set up in the future


[20-Oct-18 08:04 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Different ports would be good as well but I heard that wouldn’t work either


[20-Oct-18 08:04 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Yeah without a load balancing mechanism it will be hard for big farms


[20-Oct-18 08:04 AM] arweave-sam#9630
An alternative is to peer one of the internal nodes off the external facing node


[20-Oct-18 08:04 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Ooo very interesting.


[20-Oct-18 08:05 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Have like my “DMZ” node act as the proxy for all other internal nodes


[20-Oct-18 08:05 AM] arweave-sam#9630
So you start one node in the usual way, set up port forwarding to that internal IP, then start another node --


[20-Oct-18 08:05 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Exactly  


[20-Oct-18 08:05 AM] Vilenarios#8742
If my internal node mines a block...


[20-Oct-18 08:05 AM] arweave-sam#9630
It posts to the DMZ node


[20-Oct-18 08:06 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Which posts to the wider net


[20-Oct-18 08:06 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Seems like a single point of failure still but it could maybe be a workaround d


[20-Oct-18 08:06 AM] tiamat#9131
Sam, with internal nodes, aren't we getting some issues? like our nodes trying to connect to inexistent IPs?


[20-Oct-18 08:06 AM] tiamat#9131
*unreacheable


[20-Oct-18 08:07 AM] arweave-sam#9630
There was an issue a while ago with peers adding themselves (including with internal network IPs) to their peer list


[20-Oct-18 08:08 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Is that what you are referencing?


[20-Oct-18 08:08 AM] tiamat#9131
yeah


[20-Oct-18 08:08 AM] tiamat#9131
peer lists with IPs from private networks


[20-Oct-18 08:14 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We fixed that back before 1.5-BETA-1, I believe.

Anyone else see a massive reduction in rewards?  I went from finding a few blocks per hour before yesterday to just a few blocks in the last 24 hours.  It would be cool if the system could report hash rates to the public.

[20-Oct-18 01:36 PM] ATLAS#7218
@tiamat I think there is still a big advantage for early starters. Only way to get an old block which you don't have is when there is a new block which requires that block as recall block if I understood correctly. So even after running for a month, I don't think I'll still have all the block. If I knew this would happen, I would have started mining long time ago. One of my deepest regrets

    stored_recall_block_for_foreign_verification

I think this is due to the fact that I have a few downloaded blocks.
Q: Can I download all blocks manually? And what to do after this message - restart the server or just wait?


[20-Oct-18 02:06 PM] ATLAS#7218
It is downloading blocks


[20-Oct-18 02:06 PM] ATLAS#7218
If you dont have the recall block, you can't compete for mining the new block


[20-Oct-18 02:07 PM] ATLAS#7218
So it only downloads the recall block for verification and does not competing for the new block


[20-Oct-18 02:08 PM] ATLAS#7218
@Mike I don't think it changed anything. Its just that there is a lot more people mining. I love this rc3b. Now I am downloading 6 blocks per minute which is like 7k per day. Way faster than the previous one.


[20-Oct-18 02:10 PM] Mike#2447
Yeah, it's just wishful thinking on my part.


[20-Oct-18 02:21 PM] patrick#8648
I think there is a memory leak somewhere


[20-Oct-18 02:23 PM] patrick#8648
looked at the graph of memory usage and is on a positive incline, typical of mem leaks


[20-Oct-18 02:34 PM] Pacobits | stakely.io#9147
after reinstall and copy the blocks  , it works . Thanks @ATLAS


[20-Oct-18 02:38 PM] ATLAS#7218
Glad it worked ^^


[20-Oct-18 02:38 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Does anyone here actually have all blocks?


[20-Oct-18 02:40 PM] Mike#2447
Hard to say for certain, but I should be pretty close to having them all.


[20-Oct-18 02:40 PM] ATLAS#7218
If you have the same number of blocks in your blocks folder as current height, you have them all ^^


[20-Oct-18 02:47 PM] Mike#2447
Well I have 3 installations and they all have more blocks than the current block height.  I don't care to double check them all for invalids.  It would be nice if there was a quick prune function to quickly remove the invalids.


[20-Oct-18 03:06 PM] Vilenarios#8742
mike if you go to your info page, you should be able to see how many blocks


[20-Oct-18 03:06 PM] Vilenarios#8742
thats why i deleted all my blocks and started fresh with the latest RC


[20-Oct-18 03:06 PM] Vilenarios#8742
had a bunch of weird stuff there


[20-Oct-18 03:18 PM] Mike#2447
I'd rather not take down a miner, but since I'm not finding any blocks anyway, it's probably not a big deal.  I was trying to do a fresh install on WSL, but couldn't get it working right.  I'm going to try one more time on a new machine.


[20-Oct-18 03:18 PM] Vilenarios#8742
hey what u mean you couldnt get it working right?


[20-Oct-18 03:18 PM] Vilenarios#8742
you need a certain version of windows


[20-Oct-18 03:19 PM] Vilenarios#8742
version 1709 or above


[20-Oct-18 04:42 PM] Marcin#0065
@Mike i can help you, or at least try to, if u like. I did struggle myself a bit, but now its working like a charm


[20-Oct-18 07:42 PM] patrick#8648
@arweave-sam  i can share with you some graphs on the possible memory leak


[21-Oct-18 01:33 AM] patrick#8648
Anyone seeing what's happening on viewblock?


[21-Oct-18 01:36 AM] ATLAS#7218
It has no block from last 3 days?


[21-Oct-18 01:38 AM] Marcin#0065
it working now i think
but
it showing 0 AR on my miner acxcount? WTF? xD hope its getting fixed soon


[21-Oct-18 01:43 AM] Marcin#0065
okay, now its seems to be fixed, shows AR again

is the system memory low ?because its a 16GB ram


[21-Oct-18 02:09 AM] ATLAS#7218
I think there is some memory leakage. No way it is not enough.


[21-Oct-18 02:10 AM] yemboy#6783
what memory size is adequate?


[21-Oct-18 02:11 AM] ATLAS#7218
8gb should be enough


[21-Oct-18 02:11 AM] ATLAS#7218
4gb is fine also but 8gb is recommended


[21-Oct-18 02:12 AM] yemboy#6783
i have more than needed then..am using a 16gb system


[21-Oct-18 02:13 AM] ATLAS#7218
Yup. It is enough. If that message persists, just restart your miner.


[21-Oct-18 02:14 AM] yemboy#6783
okay..thanks


[21-Oct-18 02:14 AM] yemboy#6783
does the miner use all available cpu or just 1 cpu


[21-Oct-18 02:15 AM] yemboy#6783
it looks like its using just 1 cpu of the available 4


[21-Oct-18 02:15 AM] yemboy#6783
what comman can be used to specify use all cpu or number of cpu to use


[21-Oct-18 02:26 AM] tiamat#9131
when it is mining it will use all cpus unless you specify to use less with maxminers option


[21-Oct-18 02:34 AM] yemboy#6783
maxminers = 2 or - maxminers 2?


[21-Oct-18 02:35 AM] tiamat#9131
without =


[21-Oct-18 02:35 AM] tiamat#9131
also note it's per core or hyperthread


[21-Oct-18 02:35 AM] tiamat#9131
not per cpu


[21-Oct-18 02:35 AM] tiamat#9131
if you have 2 cpus, each with 4 cores you may want to start 8 mining processes

[21-Oct-18 04:50 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@patrick Yes, please! The graph would be interesting.

We have memory usage logging across all of our nodes and there does not appear to be a sustained incline. The system is pretty memory hungry in general, though. It seems that the Erlang VM is quite lazy about reclaiming memory from processes that are no longer using it, so we very quickly reach the memory high water mark level, but then the unused memory is reclaimed.


[21-Oct-18 05:48 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Viewblock still shows 0 AR for me.


[21-Oct-18 05:49 AM] Vilenarios#8742
My AR balance went up 14 overnight but viewblock has no transactions or anything new about my wallet address other than the balance. Shouldn’t I see a transaction at least?


[21-Oct-18 05:57 AM] Marcin#0065
the balance on my minign adress get added without a transaction, do you meant that?


[21-Oct-18 06:28 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Yes that’s exactly what I mean. I assume it’s a viewblock issue.


[21-Oct-18 06:45 AM] Mike#2447
I believe it's common that mined tokens don't register as a transaction.  I've seen this with other crypto as well.


[21-Oct-18 07:02 AM] Dentechr#5213
Don't they ? I mined some blocks last night but none of them show up in viewblock. Neither did I receive a reward.

someone with that too?


[21-Oct-18 07:50 AM] Mike#2447
@Dentechr If you're going off what is printed in the console, I have found it unreliable.  I routinely see that I have found a block only to discover that it was invalid.  If you check  your blocks folder, you should see the block you mined next to another block of the same number.


[21-Oct-18 07:52 AM] tiamat#9131
I don't think it means it's invalid, I think someone found that block number before you and you simply didn't know about it. And his block was accepted by the majority of the peers.


[21-Oct-18 07:53 AM] Mike#2447
@Marcin I'm sure I've seen that error before.


[21-Oct-18 07:53 AM] Mike#2447
@tiamat I thought that was the definition of invalid block.


[21-Oct-18 07:53 AM] tiamat#9131
but if this happens very often, I think the communication between peers should be improved


[21-Oct-18 07:54 AM] tiamat#9131
Well, I think the definition is like you did something wrong when you created it or you tried to cheat with the puzzle solution  


[21-Oct-18 07:57 AM] Mike#2447
I believe the problems I was having with WSL were due to me having copied files to the installation from Windows using the Windows file explorer.  From what I subsequently read, that action can corrupt a WSL instance.


[21-Oct-18 08:50 AM] Dentechr#5213
oke so this does not mean you mined a block and received a fee at all

[21-Oct-18 11:58 PM] Marcin#0065
Whats the technical reason to have 0 real mined blocks of all messages shown? Just too late mined? Being behind too much? 
At least as far i see from the block heigh, im in sync pretty good. 
I did let the miner run for testing in native ubuntu and had 0 problems. 
I got multiple messages about mined blocks, but none of them is existing. So i assume its calculatiin blocks too late?

Can we have those messages not in the terminal then? Or maybe a note behind like: "you mined that block, but u were too slow, more luck next time" ? XD :D


[22-Oct-18 12:50 AM] tiamat#9131
the thing is you don't know right away that your block was not accepted


[22-Oct-18 01:28 AM] Marcin#0065
But when i check for the blocks, it says "block not found" :/ so i assume its not existing. Furthermore my adress aint popping up in the list. And i have a easy to remember beginning of my mining adress :)


[22-Oct-18 01:45 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The issue regarding blocks being mined locally, but then not showing up on VB (etc), will be that the block you mined has not been accepted by the wider network. This is essentially because the connectivity based (Wildfire) part of the competition happens after that block mined message is shown. I will make a ticket for logging 10 blocks after one of your blocks has been mined that it was actually accepted by the network.


[22-Oct-18 01:46 AM] arweave-sam#9630
In order to optimise the number of your mined blocks being accepted, you need to compete with your connectivity. The faster your node replies to requests from others, the higher the likelihood that your block will be the one chosen by the network.


[22-Oct-18 01:48 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Improving the 'settlement time' of new blocks in the network (as we are planning to do so) will lower the randomness in this aspect of mining, but the core connectivity competition will remain.

@arweave-sam   http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_20.1.tar.gz   this is the one used as per the install.sh from  arweave.

Ok

Do you have another version installed locally, perhaps?

@yemboy Using F4s_v2, which is 4cpu/8gb ram.  Originally i was doing 2cpu/4gb ram with the B2s but they kept hitting RAM issues


[22-Oct-18 07:08 AM] yemboy#6783
@Vilenarios thanks..I just set up on azure as well , I have joined arweave network successfully but not seeing accepting foreign job and make log isn't progressing at all. But I can see download blocks increasing..any idea what could be wrong?


[22-Oct-18 07:13 AM] Vilenarios#8742
did you open up port 1984 in the network security group?

yous hould be3 able to browse to the public ip address of your m,achine over port 1984

the error report seems different  @tiamat  before there  some beam file error with erlang 20.1, so i installed 21.1


[22-Oct-18 07:56 AM] Mike#2447
@awkweird I believe Sam has indicated that it is an Erlang info message and not anything to be concerned with.


[22-Oct-18 07:57 AM] tiamat#9131
yeah, a peak in memory usage, not necessarily concerning


[22-Oct-18 07:58 AM] tiamat#9131
@woombash so you upgraded Erlang,  now I'd try to get a new clean Arweave from github

Thanks @tiamat


[22-Oct-18 07:59 AM] arweave-sam#9630
That is what I would have suggested  


[22-Oct-18 07:59 AM] woombash#1763
okay, i would try that with a  new clean clone from github, thanks @tiamat


[22-Oct-18 08:00 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Thanks @Mike, too


[22-Oct-18 08:00 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Those memory messages indeed are not important (unless you really are on a low memory machine)

what is your start command line?

@woombash you should uninstall erlang20. 1

Why does beam use so much ram now? That seems to be new.


[22-Oct-18 08:29 AM] tiamat#9131
yes, @Vilenarios I also noticed an increase, I wonder if it is because the network has more nodes or if it's something else

[22-Oct-18 08:43 AM] tiamat#9131
you should choose a peer that you trust and that has the  same  version as you  


[22-Oct-18 08:44 AM] tiamat#9131
but trust is much more important when you do operations with AR like using your wallet, when running a  node I don't think you can get much harm

I had peered my miners to 34.216.88.202 based on a post of Sam's a couple days ago.  Today I found that the current block on some of my machines was way behind the proper network.  If you check the stats for 34.216.88.202, its current block is 68076, while the actual current block is 68225.

http://52.56.119.91:1984/info


[22-Oct-18 09:10 AM] tiamat#9131
@Mike if you select a peer when connecting, you will get from it a bigger list of peers and you will connect with those, so if your starting peer enters a fork by itself, you should be ok, were you also 200 blocks behind?


[22-Oct-18 09:12 AM] Mike#2447
@tiamat I was behind.  I find it odd that the different block height IPs still show up as peers.


[22-Oct-18 09:14 AM] Mike#2447
If you check http://52.56.119.91:1984/peers you can see that it lists 34.216.88.202 even though they are at different block heights.


[22-Oct-18 09:14 AM] Vilenarios#8742
oh snap, i didnt know about /peers


[22-Oct-18 09:20 AM] ATLAS#7218
Is there any way to get the peers in order of wildfire score?


[22-Oct-18 09:21 AM] ATLAS#7218
@Mike Probably it is a peer with a  low reputation. I mean thats the point of wildfire right?


[22-Oct-18 09:31 AM] Mike#2447
My understanding was that the peers are listed per wildfire ranking.  @arweave-sam can tell us for sure.


[22-Oct-18 09:53 AM] Pacobits | stakely.io#9147
two blocks mined and no rewards


[22-Oct-18 10:09 AM] Dentechr#5213
same here, i think there are only a couple peers with high wildfire ranking which mine all the blocks a.t.m. correct ?


[22-Oct-18 10:15 AM] Marcin#0065
Not very ideal, decentralized politics ;)


[22-Oct-18 10:15 AM] Pacobits | stakely.io#9147

[22-Oct-18 10:37 AM] ATLAS#7218
can we not get list of peers on the make log? It takes a lot of space and in the future, peers will get much more.


[22-Oct-18 10:48 AM] arweave-sam#9630
> can we not get list of peers on the make log? It takes a lot of space and in the future, peers will get much more.

Are you asking for peers not to be listed in the log in the future?


[22-Oct-18 10:48 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Sorry, not quite sure I understood


[22-Oct-18 10:48 AM] ATLAS#7218
yeah


[22-Oct-18 10:50 AM] ATLAS#7218
In `make log`, it is listing ~80 peers when starting fork recovery.


[22-Oct-18 10:50 AM] ATLAS#7218
Also, is it possible to get your nodes wildfire stats?


[22-Oct-18 10:53 AM] tiamat#9131
you could open a github issue ticket and request different log level option


[22-Oct-18 10:57 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep, just showing one peer there or a count would be fine for now


[22-Oct-18 10:59 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Regarding seeing WF score, there isn't one single number that defines your score in the system, so we can't expose it directly. One of the three things we are working on this week to improve miner experience is publishing regular 'maps' of the WF network, so you can see where you are in reference to other nodes.


[22-Oct-18 11:01 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The other two things are a nice infographic that explains the different stages of mining an Arweave block, how you can optimise mining, and common pitfalls, as well as an improved miner log.


[22-Oct-18 11:02 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The new miner log will make it clear that just having mined a block is not enough -- it needs to be accepted, too. Where is where being a good citizen with WF is rewarded.


[22-Oct-18 11:03 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Not sure when the 'mining infographic' or new mining log will be out, but the first network maps should be with you later this week.


[22-Oct-18 11:06 AM] tiamat#9131
how about the memory ?  few days/weeks ago beam was sitting below 5% now jumping often to 30%


[22-Oct-18 11:06 AM] tiamat#9131
and many complained about this


[22-Oct-18 11:06 AM] tiamat#9131
any reason?


[22-Oct-18 11:10 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Erlang likes to hold memory until it runs low to avoid reallocs/frees. The console message is harmless unless you actually have a low memory machine (less than 8gb) -- it just frees memory only when it needs to. This  should not be a problem if you are using other programs on the system either, as Erlang will just be forced to garbage collect more frequently.


[22-Oct-18 11:11 AM] arweave-sam#9630
If this is an issue long term we can look at ways to constrain the memory of the Erlang VM.


[22-Oct-18 11:12 AM] tiamat#9131
To me it's concerning because I found it once with 100 blocks behind and a high watermark alert, the system has 32 GB


[22-Oct-18 11:13 AM] tiamat#9131
and it was pretty stuck, if it happens again I will take a closer look


[22-Oct-18 11:15 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Being 100 blocks behind is definitely concerning, but the high watermark is fair normal. By default the memory allocators seem very greedy (taking until they run out, then freeing as necessary).


[22-Oct-18 12:23 PM] yemboy#6783
Saw a block mined..got the reward and later disappeared


[22-Oct-18 12:41 PM] patrick#8648
@arweave-sam  sorry about the confusion on the memory leak. It seems that as you said, erlang takes a large amonut of memory, and then all of a sudden garbage collects it and it goes back down. No problematic memory leak on my end


[22-Oct-18 05:08 PM] Silkapil#1153
guys, is it mandatory to have port 1984 opened to the world? I hope not...


[22-Oct-18 05:35 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Yes, it is


[22-Oct-18 05:35 PM] Vilenarios#8742
How would you think other nodes can connect to you?


[22-Oct-18 05:36 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Conversely, you could have 1 machine with port 1984 opened, and other machines on your internal network peered with your single, internet facing machine


[22-Oct-18 06:38 PM] patrick#8648
Well how would other nodes talk to you?


[22-Oct-18 06:38 PM] patrick#8648
That's how you sync with the network


[22-Oct-18 07:32 PM] Mike#2447
It seems no matter what I do, all my miners are always one block behind the current block.  I'm not sure where the bottleneck is occurring, but I'm thinking that it's the reason I can no longer mine effectively.  Any creative ideas on how to increase throughput or reduce latency?


[22-Oct-18 07:33 PM] Mike#2447
To clarify, I am still mining blocks all the time, but they are all too old to get accepted by the network.

It used to be 80~100 but now it just hovers around 30.

Also is it ok if my node latency spikes when it's mining?

By how much does it spike, baz?


[23-Oct-18 02:08 AM] Marcin#0065
Baz, reduce the amount of cores. Set "max_miners" a round 2-4 Cores less from ur max amount of ur system
I had the same problem as you, then i did it and it helped me.


[23-Oct-18 02:09 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep, that will work. You should only be concerned if the node latency spikes massively though.


[23-Oct-18 02:31 AM] ATLAS#7218
its usually 10k but when its mining, it goes to 70k


[23-Oct-18 02:38 AM] ATLAS#7218
How do you set max_miners()?


[23-Oct-18 02:44 AM] Marcin#0065
"max_miners 8" 

Gives you max 8 cores (or it suppose to)


[23-Oct-18 02:44 AM] Marcin#0065
But im not sure how the OS manages it itself


[23-Oct-18 02:45 AM] Marcin#0065
I see all my fores working still, even i reduced by 4 cores. But i dont have any problems since the


[23-Oct-18 03:01 AM] ATLAS#7218
Hmm changes nothing. Every cores are being used and latency spike is as usual


[23-Oct-18 03:04 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hmmm. If you try with 'max_miners 0' on your command line does it chance anything?


[23-Oct-18 03:06 AM] ATLAS#7218
Yup. No change


[23-Oct-18 03:07 AM] ATLAS#7218
Ok I restarted the server with the max_miners 6 option and now its using only 6 cores


[23-Oct-18 03:07 AM] ATLAS#7218
But the latency spike is as usual


[23-Oct-18 03:35 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I would only be concerned if the latency spikes above around ~500,000 or if the `queue_length` jumps dramatically.

```kernel: [1620150.200760] Out of memory in UB 44763: OOM killed process 11385 (beam.smp) score 0 vm:8560964kB, rss:3944004kB, swap:0kB```


[23-Oct-18 05:33 AM] 2072 [ANFRA]#9291
Is there any way to make erlang more aggressive on its memory management to avoid this?


[23-Oct-18 05:40 AM] woombash#1763
@tiamat  it was an accidental power failure. But I again tried with a fresh ubuntu copy. Same error. I tried two times after that with fresh ubuntu installations.  With the fresh codebase clone and erlang.


[23-Oct-18 05:48 AM] yemboy#6783
@arweave-sam what if queue_lenght always @ 0?


[23-Oct-18 05:58 AM] yemboy#6783
@arweave-sam what could be the reason..I mined a block, gets recorded on viewblock but llater gets awarded to someone else


[23-Oct-18 06:05 AM] yemboy#6783
Make log output don't display again

@2072 [ANFRA] i have the same issue with 4 gb RAM: IT restart continusly s after 6 hours running. I have 8 gb swap but the process doesn't use it. Anyone knows  how to run it more effecient? or almost that the process use the swap memory


[23-Oct-18 06:26 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Ya my 4gb tests didn’t go well with the exception of win server core 2016 with WSL. Running 8gb now.


[23-Oct-18 06:42 AM] Mike#2447
Setting the max_miners flag seems to have fixed my lag.  When I checked htop during mining, all cores/threads were at 100%, so it appears the default n-1 cores/threads was not being enforced.  Also, like baz, I had to restart the miner a couple times for the setting to take effect.


[23-Oct-18 06:43 AM] Mike#2447
@tiamat  I was not polling.


[23-Oct-18 06:46 AM] Mike#2447
Speaking of polling, for miners that cannot be placed in DMZ or have port 1984 forwarded, does the polling flag really allow them to mine successfully?  I recall not having issues when mining with polling months ago, but now with all the added hashing power, I wonder if it's still a viable option.  What is the down-side to polling?


[23-Oct-18 06:46 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I wonder if the miner catches some settings.


[23-Oct-18 06:46 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Mike my internal miner lists my dmz miner as it’s peer. Sam was saying that should work. I’m not using polling on my internal miner.


[23-Oct-18 06:49 AM] Mike#2447
I briefly tried the internal-external peering yesterday, but didn't have much luck.  I will experiment more today.


[23-Oct-18 06:49 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Mine joins the network just fine, downloads blocks with no issues


[23-Oct-18 06:49 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Whether it actually can mine a new block successfully is another story...


[23-Oct-18 06:51 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Hmm my dmz miner is showing 0 peers now... but my internal is showing 80+


[23-Oct-18 06:59 AM] ivhturp#3325
A quick question - When a block is downloaded, is the recall block also downloaded?


[23-Oct-18 06:59 AM] arweave-sam#9630
No


[23-Oct-18 06:59 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Apart from when you are joining


[23-Oct-18 06:59 AM] arweave-sam#9630
In which case you download the block and its recall


[23-Oct-18 07:00 AM] arweave-sam#9630
> Also, like baz, I had to restart the miner a couple times for the setting to take effect.

This is strange. We use `max_miners` all the time for our peers.


[23-Oct-18 07:00 AM] arweave-sam#9630
To be clear, this is with appending `max_miners 5` (or whatever) to the command line you run to start the node?


[23-Oct-18 07:00 AM] arweave-sam#9630
> I briefly tried the internal-external peering yesterday, but didn't have much luck.  I will experiment more today.

I would be interested to hear how this goes.


[23-Oct-18 07:02 AM] Mike#2447
Yes.  I stopped the miner, set the flag and it started back up still using all cores.  I stopped the miner again and started again with the same settings and then it took effect.


[23-Oct-18 07:02 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Wow


[23-Oct-18 07:02 AM] ivhturp#3325
@arweave-sam Do you mean the 50 blocks that are downloaded  initially? I have increased it to download all the blocks. However, i noticed that recall blocks are not being downloaded


[23-Oct-18 07:02 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Interesting


[23-Oct-18 07:02 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@ivhturp You don't want to do that -- you will end up being blacklisted by other peers


[23-Oct-18 07:02 AM] arweave-sam#9630
So your blocks won't be accepted


[23-Oct-18 07:03 AM] arweave-sam#9630
If you run RC-3b unmodified there is a very short delay, but the download speed is fast enough and you won't trigger DDoS protection


[23-Oct-18 07:04 AM] ivhturp#3325
Ah, I am not aware of it. What are the blacklisting conditions?


[23-Oct-18 07:04 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The one that may catch you here is simply a request/time period count


[23-Oct-18 07:04 AM] ivhturp#3325
Okay!


[23-Oct-18 07:05 AM] ivhturp#3325
So what are the options to download all the blocks ?


[23-Oct-18 07:05 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Running RC-3b normally will go and download all the blocks for you


[23-Oct-18 07:05 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You just have to let it run


[23-Oct-18 07:06 AM] ivhturp#3325
okay, trying it. Can I run the same code on the current blocks/wallets data. Hope it won't corrupt them


[23-Oct-18 07:08 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Please can you rephrase that question?


[23-Oct-18 07:14 AM] ivhturp#3325
Sorry for the confusion. 
I already have some blocks downloaded using stable release. Can I copy this blocks directory  and run RC-3b code on it.


[23-Oct-18 07:16 AM] arweave-sam#9630
When you run your current version and go to http://127.0.0.1:1984


[23-Oct-18 07:16 AM] arweave-sam#9630
What release number does it give you?


[23-Oct-18 07:21 AM] ivhturp#3325
"version":3,"release":9


[23-Oct-18 07:21 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Thanks


[23-Oct-18 07:22 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You will be able to upgrade smoothly now. However....


[23-Oct-18 07:22 AM] Mike#2447

Hi everyone,

`RC-4` is now out. There are a couple of minor fixes in here that resolve the problem with joining on peers running older versions of the software, and slightly increase block download speed.

Thanks to @Marcin for some testing help!


[23-Oct-18 07:23 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You can grab the new version with `git fetch ; git checkout N.1.5.0.0-RC-4`.


[23-Oct-18 07:24 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@Mike Thanks, I will make a Github ticket


[23-Oct-18 07:30 AM] Mike#2447
It crashes during the 100 block write.  I keep trying to join on both machines and it gets a little further each time before crashing.  Weird.


[23-Oct-18 07:32 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Which peer, @Mike ?


[23-Oct-18 07:32 AM] arweave-sam#9630
(Ticket is now created)


[23-Oct-18 07:32 AM] Mike#2447
Are you asking which peers I'm trying to join to?


[23-Oct-18 07:35 AM] ATLAS#7218
@Mike What did max_miners fix for you?


[23-Oct-18 07:38 AM] ATLAS#7218
Afaik, it didnt change anything for me


[23-Oct-18 07:38 AM] ATLAS#7218
And I still didnt find any block, mining 2 i7 in the last 2 days


[23-Oct-18 07:38 AM] Mike#2447
I was using 8 on a 12 thread CPU.


[23-Oct-18 07:41 AM] ATLAS#7218
I mean how did lowering your threads affect your miner?


[23-Oct-18 07:43 AM] ATLAS#7218
You said you have improvements


[23-Oct-18 07:43 AM] Mike#2447
I stopped lagging.  When I check the stats, it matches the rest of the network instead of being 1+ blocks behind.


[23-Oct-18 07:44 AM] ATLAS#7218
How much was your node latency?


[23-Oct-18 07:44 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Did you guys get the latest RC?


[23-Oct-18 07:44 AM] Mike#2447
It varied, but typically around 100,000 or more.


[23-Oct-18 07:45 AM] Mike#2447
I bumped the miner count to 10/12 and it's lagging again.


[23-Oct-18 07:45 AM] ATLAS#7218
Hmm. Mine is usually 10k. But it spikes to 70~100k when it starts mining


[23-Oct-18 07:45 AM] ATLAS#7218
even with half the core, it still spikes


[23-Oct-18 07:46 AM] Mike#2447
I'm always mining, so I don't know what the non-mining metric is.


[23-Oct-18 07:47 AM] Mike#2447
Trying 9/12 now.


[23-Oct-18 07:47 AM] ATLAS#7218
So now your latency stays low even when mining?


[23-Oct-18 07:47 AM] ATLAS#7218
Does it fluctuate a lot? How much is your latency?


[23-Oct-18 07:49 AM] Mike#2447
Well I stopped the miner, so I can't say for sure, but at 8/12 I recall it was much lower.


[23-Oct-18 07:49 AM] Mike#2447
I'll report back on what 9/12 does.


[23-Oct-18 07:49 AM] ATLAS#7218
Ok thanks a lot.


[23-Oct-18 07:54 AM] ATLAS#7218
How does this latency work? I used 8/8 cores and I was down 5 blocks from the other nodes. But it still showed 50k latency


[23-Oct-18 07:54 AM] Vilenarios#8742
So what happens if i upgrade to the latest, but my mining peer is not? Is that a problem?


[23-Oct-18 07:56 AM] Mike#2447
I'm all over the place with latency.  One minute I'm 150k, the next I'm 50k.


[23-Oct-18 07:58 AM] ATLAS#7218
How do you easily compare your heights to other peers? Just check each of their info?


[23-Oct-18 07:59 AM] Vilenarios#8742
ya, thats what i do


[23-Oct-18 07:59 AM] Vilenarios#8742
just load em up in a browser


[23-Oct-18 08:00 AM] ATLAS#7218
Yeah haha. Its just I'm not sure if the peers I'm checking is also late or not.


[23-Oct-18 08:00 AM] Mike#2447
Yeah, I check a few peers and/or viewblock.


[23-Oct-18 08:02 AM] arweave-sam#9630
> So what happens if i upgrade to the latest, but my mining peer is not? Is that a problem?

No, that is fine


[23-Oct-18 08:02 AM] arweave-sam#9630
`RC-4` is actually _more_ tolerant of older version than `RC-3b`


[23-Oct-18 08:02 AM] Vilenarios#8742
sweet!


[23-Oct-18 08:03 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Just curious Sam, how do you guys test these releases?


[23-Oct-18 08:03 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Im assuming you run some QA/UAT on them before releasing it to the masses


[23-Oct-18 08:06 AM] Mike#2447
So with max_miners 9, I was still lagging.  I went back to max_miners 8 and I'm staying current.


[23-Oct-18 08:07 AM] ATLAS#7218
Damn. With 5/8 threads I'm lagging but the other 3 threads are barely used


[23-Oct-18 08:07 AM] Mike#2447
Latency still around 50k.


[23-Oct-18 08:07 AM] Mike#2447
Better than 150k though!


[23-Oct-18 08:07 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I wonder if its splitting the cpu usage


[23-Oct-18 08:07 AM] Vilenarios#8742
meaning mining is actually using most of the threads


[23-Oct-18 08:07 AM] Vilenarios#8742
but we need to reserve other threads for things like the web components


[23-Oct-18 08:07 AM] Vilenarios#8742
so if all threads are in use for mining, the system cant post web requests


[23-Oct-18 08:08 AM] ATLAS#7218
Yeah and 1 thread is reserved by default


[23-Oct-18 08:08 AM] ATLAS#7218
But why does it require that many threads


[23-Oct-18 08:08 AM] ATLAS#7218
Even with 3 empty threads, I'm still lagging 2 blocks behind


[23-Oct-18 08:08 AM] ATLAS#7218
Latency is 10-50k


[23-Oct-18 08:10 AM] ATLAS#7218
Isn't it the issue with your peers? It should stop mining when you receive external blocks right? But mine just keeps mining until its late by 1-2 blocks already


[23-Oct-18 08:14 AM] Mike#2447
htop is a bit hard to read.  It appears all threads are still being used, but a constantly rotating few of them take small breaks.  Overall it still appears that more than 8/12 (2/3) of the compute power is being utilized.


[23-Oct-18 08:15 AM] Mike#2447
I would need a graph that logged over time to know for sure.


[23-Oct-18 08:18 AM] Mike#2447
I have another 6 core miner that I flagged with max_miners 5 and it's still using all cores 100%.


[23-Oct-18 08:21 AM] ivhturp#3325
`RC-4` looks great in terms of block download speed 🤘


[23-Oct-18 08:22 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Ya, so far so good  


[23-Oct-18 08:41 AM] ATLAS#7218
@Mike Its only lagging behind when trying to recover from fork now. Everything looks fine and I tried with 6/8 and it has no lag if it didn't fork


[23-Oct-18 08:42 AM] ATLAS#7218
Usually my 2 thread is below 10% usage when mining with 6 thread. 7 was too much I guess. It often went all 100%.


[23-Oct-18 08:48 AM] Marcin#0065

Has the team ever done a survey on the mining community like how much storage, network bandwith, resources etc.?

Just thinking ahead here - if AR actually gets on an exchange, gets adopted by dapps, gets built into multiple clients to upload data - then the need for the network capacity gets bigger


[23-Oct-18 09:22 AM] ATLAS#7218
40gb received in last 4 days


[23-Oct-18 09:22 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Does the team have the tools to know the capacity/limits of the network? Or because this is truely decentralized, its kind of up to the miners?


[23-Oct-18 09:23 AM] Vilenarios#8742
viewblock has 107.4MB of data stored


[23-Oct-18 09:25 AM] ATLAS#7218
I have like 30k blocks but the size of arweave folder is 15gb already

never seen this before but it just appeared twice in last 20 minute

Node is running without problem. Just curious what this is about


[23-Oct-18 09:35 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I havent seen that one


[23-Oct-18 09:36 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yeah, it will pretty much dump all of the virtual memory on the server


[23-Oct-18 09:36 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Thanks for posting bad, looking into it


[23-Oct-18 09:37 AM] arweave-sam#9630
*baz!


[23-Oct-18 09:40 AM] ATLAS#7218
now i got the same error as awkweird


[23-Oct-18 09:42 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Baz are you on windows subsystem for linux?


[23-Oct-18 09:42 AM] ATLAS#7218
linux


[23-Oct-18 09:42 AM] ATLAS#7218
dual boot


[23-Oct-18 09:43 AM] ATLAS#7218
18.04LTS. Never seen those errors before. So probably there is some problem with RC4


[23-Oct-18 09:43 AM] ATLAS#7218
Except those messages, its running smooth


[23-Oct-18 09:43 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Please can you send me your peer list @ATLAS and @awkweird ?


[23-Oct-18 09:46 AM] arweave-sam#9630
It looks like there is an errant node on it that has not updated for a very long time. RC-4 spreads your download requests across many peers, so it hits the old ones more frequently (causing this error message). It is mostly harmless.


[23-Oct-18 10:10 AM] arweave-sam#9630
For those testing `RC-4`, please run the `git fetch ; git checkout N.1.5.0.0-RC-4` and restart your node. Thanks!


[23-Oct-18 10:11 AM] Marcin#0065
working fine so far


[23-Oct-18 10:13 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Okay Sam - all restarted


[23-Oct-18 10:15 AM] Pacobits | stakely.io#9147
updated, and restarted. ok.


[23-Oct-18 10:16 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@Vilenarios you asked an interesting question earlier about our testing structure:

We start with a battery of ~125 tests that range from unit tests to 'tiny network tests'. The tiny network tests spawn many nodes inside the Erlang VM, manipulate the network into many different [often unusual] situations, then test the behaviour of the network. We then also have simulations of very large networks inside a single node, including network failure states, etc.

Once we are comfortable with the operation inside the machine, depending on the size of the update we might start a private inter-node network across a few machines. Once that is not displaying issues, we add a single node to the main network and monitor its activity for between 12 hours and 3 days. After that we have a set of canary nodes that we deploy to, again monitoring for errors. If it is a really big update (like `1.5-BETA-1`) we will deploy it to a further group of nodes, and continue monitoring.

Finally, after that we tag the release :).


[23-Oct-18 10:19 AM] arweave-sam#9630
In terms of monitoring, we have central log submission, so we can see what all of our nodes are doing, all the time. We then have a separate system that produces statistics and graphing based on those logs. In parallel, we have a graphing system for many 'vital signs' across the network -- from VM memory usage, to number of HTTP errors, etc.

[23-Oct-18 10:23 AM] Mike#2447
Where does ViewBlock get their data?


[23-Oct-18 10:24 AM] arweave-sam#9630
They have a node


[23-Oct-18 10:25 AM] arweave-sam#9630
(Maybe a few)


[23-Oct-18 10:25 AM] arweave-sam#9630
And they just ping it through the HTTP API  


[23-Oct-18 10:25 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Awesome, thank you for the background Sam.


[23-Oct-18 10:26 AM] arweave-sam#9630
No worries at all


[23-Oct-18 10:26 AM] Mike#2447
Are they mining?  They are routinely ahead of other nodes on block height.


[23-Oct-18 10:26 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Testing for something like this is a pretty interesting topic


[23-Oct-18 10:26 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Not mining, I don't think


[23-Oct-18 10:26 AM] arweave-sam#9630
They follow like our nodes


[23-Oct-18 10:27 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I am wondering whether what you are talking about is actually an off-by-one error in the reporting logic. Have you checked the hashes?


[23-Oct-18 10:29 AM] Mike#2447
I see VB is reporting block 68886 6 minutes ago, but when I check all the recommended peers, they are at 68883 or 68884.


[23-Oct-18 10:29 AM] patrick#8648
ya i had the same


[23-Oct-18 10:30 AM] arweave-sam#9630
And the hashes?


[23-Oct-18 10:30 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Because that does seem pretty odd


[23-Oct-18 10:30 AM] patrick#8648
well it seems that most people in the recommended list were mining on a fork


[23-Oct-18 10:30 AM] patrick#8648
that lost out


[23-Oct-18 10:31 AM] patrick#8648
wait 9 mins since last block on viewblock


[23-Oct-18 10:31 AM] patrick#8648
maybe there wiill be a reorg


[23-Oct-18 10:31 AM] Mike#2447
Sorry, which hashes?


[23-Oct-18 10:34 AM] ATLAS#7218
Yup. I'm behind 3 blocks.


[23-Oct-18 10:34 AM] patrick#8648
mmmm most of my miners are still trying to mine fdrom 68881


[23-Oct-18 10:34 AM] patrick#8648
is the netowrk splittting? seems liek those blocks dont get propagated


[23-Oct-18 10:34 AM] ATLAS#7218
Its possible that VB is on a fork


[23-Oct-18 10:34 AM] patrick#8648
but the blocks should sitll propagate


[23-Oct-18 10:34 AM] patrick#8648
this is 6 blocks


[23-Oct-18 10:35 AM] patrick#8648
the only way we can win is if we're longeer


[23-Oct-18 10:35 AM] ATLAS#7218
I mean we are all forked. So majority will likely win. VB will rollback. probably


[23-Oct-18 10:35 AM] patrick#8648
so we're on the losing one


[23-Oct-18 10:35 AM] ATLAS#7218
It happened a lot


[23-Oct-18 10:35 AM] tiamat#9131
VB is generally behind, not ahead


[23-Oct-18 10:35 AM] ATLAS#7218
VB gave me block reward and took it back a lot of times :(


[23-Oct-18 10:35 AM] patrick#8648
well seems like the other one wins, it's got bigger miners


[23-Oct-18 10:36 AM] ATLAS#7218
How do you check them all?


[23-Oct-18 10:36 AM] tiamat#9131
it can take your reward back only if it was on a fork


[23-Oct-18 10:36 AM] ATLAS#7218
And how do you know its bigger? All I can do is ping


[23-Oct-18 10:36 AM] patrick#8648
look at the miners that win it, T1G, wine, G5


[23-Oct-18 10:36 AM] patrick#8648
they're the ones winning most of the time


[23-Oct-18 10:36 AM] patrick#8648
and now they're ahead bby 6+ blocks, i assume a reorg is in order for us


[23-Oct-18 10:37 AM] ATLAS#7218
@tiamat exactly, they show the forked info a lot of times. So VB probably has very few nodes


[23-Oct-18 10:37 AM] patrick#8648
@arweave-sam  at what point does the software change which fork to work on?


[23-Oct-18 10:38 AM] Mike#2447
Is it possible to see which IP has mined a block?


[23-Oct-18 10:40 AM] ATLAS#7218
Yeah. It would be nice to have the major ones as a peer.


[23-Oct-18 10:41 AM] Mike#2447
Or at least see who they are peered with.


[23-Oct-18 10:41 AM] ATLAS#7218
I'm behind 7 blocks :(


[23-Oct-18 10:48 AM] Mike#2447
Every since I raised the issue, all the recommended peers and VB are now in sync LOL.


[23-Oct-18 10:49 AM] Mike#2447
Perhaps this is just due to the small size of the network at this point.


[23-Oct-18 10:49 AM] ATLAS#7218
Yeah. Fork will happen a lot when the network is this small.


[23-Oct-18 10:51 AM] Vilenarios#8742

hey guys, do you get ur json output over your ip adress still?

i get it only over local 127, not over ipv4 any more. port is open for sure, tested it. any idea?


[23-Oct-18 11:28 AM] ATLAS#7218
Your router should forward the 1984 port


[23-Oct-18 11:29 AM] Marcin#0065
it is


[23-Oct-18 11:29 AM] Marcin#0065
i never had problems with that, i often check on mobile outside the status


[23-Oct-18 11:29 AM] Marcin#0065
it worked fine

Hey Sam - will there be a roadmap update at some point soon?  Wondering when I should really pour the gas on the mining fire so to speak...


[23-Oct-18 12:19 PM] Mike#2447
Woohoo!  Let's see what it can do.


[23-Oct-18 12:32 PM] Vilenarios#8742
So whats the trick to getting max_miners to work?


[23-Oct-18 12:34 PM] ATLAS#7218
Add it as option when running arweave-server


[23-Oct-18 12:34 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I did - i put it as my last option - it doesnt limit my cores though


[23-Oct-18 12:34 PM] Vilenarios#8742
stopped/restarted several times...


[23-Oct-18 12:34 PM] ATLAS#7218
It might be not observed


[23-Oct-18 12:35 PM] ATLAS#7218
Try making it lower


[23-Oct-18 12:35 PM] ATLAS#7218
Like 4-5 threads lower than your number of threads


[23-Oct-18 12:35 PM] Vilenarios#8742
i did -2


[23-Oct-18 12:35 PM] Vilenarios#8742
ill try -4


[23-Oct-18 12:36 PM] Vilenarios#8742
seems like maxed processors was causing my latency to be super high


[23-Oct-18 12:36 PM] ATLAS#7218
If it is all 100%, it will probably be left behind even though the latency is low


[23-Oct-18 12:37 PM] ATLAS#7218
Lowering max miners didn't change my latency but I am always at the networks height


[23-Oct-18 12:38 PM] Vilenarios#8742
hmm setting it to 4 didnt do anything either... ill just have to wait for an update or something


[23-Oct-18 12:39 PM] ATLAS#7218
how about 1?  


[23-Oct-18 12:41 PM] ATLAS#7218
`./arweave-server peer 0.0.0.0 max_miners 6 mine`


[23-Oct-18 12:41 PM] Vilenarios#8742
i wonder if it goes by cores instead of logical processors


[23-Oct-18 01:41 PM] Vilenarios#8742
@arweave-sam I dont see any foreign block accepted messages on my "internal" node.  i only see those messages on dmz nodes.  Any particular reason you think?


[23-Oct-18 03:47 PM] paulcrypto#3698
how do i start mining?


[23-Oct-18 03:54 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Message arweave-india to be added to the mailing list.  They have some instructions to get you started.


[23-Oct-18 03:55 PM] Vilenarios#8742
You can use Ubuntu 18.0.4 or Windows Subsystem for Linux on Windows 10 with the Ubuntu app deployed from the Microsoft store

@Vilenarios Hmmm


[24-Oct-18 03:05 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Does your DMZ node list the internal node on /peers?

Hi guys, just some thoughts on cores:

My experience is that Erlang sees logical cores.  I.e., with 6 physical cores Erlang sees 12.  

I had to reduce it to 8 cores to get it consistently under 100% cpu (I think others have said the same).

I suspect consumer chips may be quite different from server chips. In my limited experience 'enterprise' chips can handle sustained heavy load much better than consumer chips, so high end chips might run more than 66% of the cores continuously.

But once I got the CPU below 100% my mine seems less erratic - but that might be taking credit away from team's improvements to the code.

Happy mining.


[24-Oct-18 03:33 AM] codybartfast#9308
@WILL ,  to set the wallet address for mining rewards add ` mining_addr  --your-wallet-address-here-- ` to the startup command.  But my guess is that is not related to the log message you quoted.

[24-Oct-18 04:46 AM] yemboy#6783
What could be the reason for loosing mined block..my Miner keeps loosing blocks mined?


[24-Oct-18 04:49 AM] ATLAS#7218
Most probably latency


[24-Oct-18 04:55 AM] yemboy#6783
Too high too low


[24-Oct-18 05:08 AM] Pacobits | stakely.io#9147
I want to notice the Arweave team that there is a major problem in the mining system. There are 10 wallets that are mining all the blocks, this is centralized mining and will have many problems for the project. As you know, when a coin is concentrated in a few wallets, this will have many problems, such as the lack of use, dump price, reduction of the community  members ... I think this is the most important issue to be resolved


[24-Oct-18 05:10 AM] Silkapil#1153
Good point Ppot, seems hard to believe that the rest of the miners don't have enough hash power to get results as well


[24-Oct-18 05:31 AM] Vilenarios#8742
ive only mined about 100AR so far across 28 cores


[24-Oct-18 05:31 AM] yemboy#6783
@ATLAS will that be because latency is too high or too low? I lost more than 4 blocks I see mined so far


[24-Oct-18 05:31 AM] Vilenarios#8742
but i started with 0 blocks


[24-Oct-18 05:32 AM] Vilenarios#8742
@arweave-sam Yes, the DMZ node lists internal node via the internal ip address (192.168.1.154)


[24-Oct-18 05:33 AM] Vilenarios#8742
My internal node managed to mine a couple candidate blocks last night - still no accepted foreign block.


[24-Oct-18 05:33 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I did set it to Polling enabled though... not sure if that helped


[24-Oct-18 05:35 AM] ATLAS#7218
@yemboy too high


[24-Oct-18 05:57 AM] Marcin#0065
I tried already to make a fair start for everybody guys, no chance in here :D ;)


[24-Oct-18 06:09 AM] ATLAS#7218
How do you expect the team to solve it? Nothing can stop them from mining with 100s of cores or whatever they have. This is the decentralized network. No regulation. Stronger ones will dominate. There is no equality or fairness in it.


[24-Oct-18 06:10 AM] Vilenarios#8742
As long as you have all the blocks, you shoudl be able to mine, so in theory it should even out once everyone has the blocks


[24-Oct-18 06:11 AM] ATLAS#7218
But people can have more hash power. Its not just the matter of having recall block.


[24-Oct-18 06:12 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I do notice that most blocks are mined by a single miner back to back


[24-Oct-18 06:12 AM] Vilenarios#8742
that happened to me as well


[24-Oct-18 06:12 AM] ATLAS#7218
So it just means they have a huge hash power


[24-Oct-18 06:14 AM] ATLAS#7218
They probably spent fortune on setting up all that hash power, and now its paying them back. This is how every PoW works.


[24-Oct-18 06:26 AM] yemboy#6783
@ATLAS any advice on how latency can be reduced


[24-Oct-18 06:28 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Is it a dedicated miner or shared? If you do a network speed test what’s your upload/download?


[24-Oct-18 06:40 AM] ATLAS#7218
Can you check you latency first? Just to make sure the cause is really latency


[24-Oct-18 06:41 AM] ATLAS#7218
`JoinEXCEPTION: {error, {1250973,invalid_string}}`


[24-Oct-18 06:42 AM] ATLAS#7218
Got this. Anyone know the reason?


[24-Oct-18 06:48 AM] yemboy#6783
@ATLAS node_state_latency: 15635


[24-Oct-18 06:48 AM] ATLAS#7218
It should be fine if that's the case


[24-Oct-18 06:48 AM] Mike#2447
15k is pretty good.  I'm regularly around 100k.


[24-Oct-18 06:49 AM] ATLAS#7218
You might be using up too much of your cpu so it takes long time to send your block to the network. Try lowering your max thread


[24-Oct-18 06:54 AM] ATLAS#7218
@arweave-sam I think we need to publicize IPs of the nodes


[24-Oct-18 06:55 AM] ATLAS#7218
This is getting out of hand. Most nodes are behind 10minutes


[24-Oct-18 06:55 AM] ATLAS#7218
We need better peers than the recommended ones. I think thats the bottleneck for most of us miners.


[24-Oct-18 06:56 AM] tiamat#9131
@ATLAS yes, PoW can be somehow centralized, but the same applies for PoS where the richest in coins, not in hardware make the most. Masternodes model is even more centralized.  Proof of Authority also.


[24-Oct-18 06:57 AM] ATLAS#7218
I didn't say any other Proof algorithms are better. I meant equality is impossible in the first place.


[24-Oct-18 06:59 AM] tiamat#9131
even if a coin is centralized around miners, like many say about Bitcoin, I don't think that is necessarily a problem, because if miners mess up the network, their business is gone, so they have to do their best to make things work well


[24-Oct-18 07:00 AM] ATLAS#7218
Umm that was my point?


[24-Oct-18 07:01 AM] tiamat#9131
ah, sorry


[24-Oct-18 07:01 AM] tiamat#9131
it was not you complaining about centralization  


[24-Oct-18 07:02 AM] tiamat#9131
the  thing is, once the Arweave gets traction, we won't be able to mine, because there will be datacenters dedicated to do this  


[24-Oct-18 07:03 AM] ATLAS#7218
Yup. But I find it odd too. I think the big miners blocked the recommended peers to make most of us fall behind


[24-Oct-18 07:03 AM] ATLAS#7218
Even viewblock gets the block 10 minutes after it got mined.


[24-Oct-18 07:04 AM] ATLAS#7218
So they go ahead, with less competition.


[24-Oct-18 07:04 AM] tiamat#9131
I think viewblock waits for one extra confirmation? I often see it behind


[24-Oct-18 07:04 AM] ATLAS#7218
Recommended peers also fall behind very often


[24-Oct-18 07:05 AM] ATLAS#7218
No I dont think they do confirmation. I often see them rolling back


[24-Oct-18 07:05 AM] Mike#2447
I think the 100 block download is too much.  It sometimes takes me several minutes to accomplish this and by the time it finishes, I end up joining the network 1-3 blocks behind.  Perhaps the miner can download 100 blocks and then download the most recent 5 blocks afterward.


[24-Oct-18 07:06 AM] ATLAS#7218
Even so, it should not take long to catch up with the fork. Its just that the new block is taking long route to come to us.


[24-Oct-18 07:06 AM] tiamat#9131
I think this is also because many nodes don't have all blocks, once the majority of nodes have everything, maybe things go smooth?


[24-Oct-18 07:06 AM] tiamat#9131
If a node keep asking for blocks, it probably loses WF score?


[24-Oct-18 07:07 AM] ATLAS#7218
I don't think so. I think the bottleneck is at recommended peers. Major miners block them, and all of us are left behind


[24-Oct-18 07:08 AM] Mike#2447
@ATLAS The catching up part is very inconsistent, at least for me.


[24-Oct-18 07:08 AM] ATLAS#7218
For me it is also inconsistent, but it is consistent in normal times.


[24-Oct-18 07:08 AM] ATLAS#7218
Now its not normal.


[24-Oct-18 07:09 AM] ATLAS#7218
Even arweave-sam said it before. They didn't want to provide recommended peers because it will be point of centralization.


[24-Oct-18 07:09 AM] ATLAS#7218
If so, they should provide all the IPs


[24-Oct-18 07:10 AM] tiamat#9131
you can get all the IPs yourself


[24-Oct-18 07:10 AM] tiamat#9131
just connect to each peer and check for /peers


[24-Oct-18 07:10 AM] tiamat#9131
someone here even had a script for this, he was showing us stats


[24-Oct-18 07:11 AM] tiamat#9131
I think fork recoveries should be quicker, it's normal and logical to wait for blocks when you have very few, but when you are 5 blocks behind you should be able to sync as quick as possible


[24-Oct-18 07:12 AM] Mike#2447
Maybe a purposeful delay should be inserted into the block submission algorithm?  Once a certain percentage of peers announce that they agree on block height/hash, then they all move forward at the same time.


[24-Oct-18 07:12 AM] ATLAS#7218
To sync, your peers should be in sync


[24-Oct-18 07:12 AM] ATLAS#7218
The thing is most of the peers you have is also forked


[24-Oct-18 07:12 AM] Mike#2447
Does anyone know if the weave operates on a tallest block method?


[24-Oct-18 07:12 AM] Mike#2447
Where whoever is furthest ahead just keeps driving the weave?


[24-Oct-18 07:12 AM] ATLAS#7218
@Mike That sounds interesting


[24-Oct-18 07:13 AM] ATLAS#7218
Now it seems so to me


[24-Oct-18 07:13 AM] tiamat#9131
but @Mike, if that block will be accepted, what will prevent a miner to already begin the search so he has a chance to be faster? he has nothing to do anyway while waiting


[24-Oct-18 07:14 AM] ATLAS#7218
Actually yeah.


[24-Oct-18 07:15 AM] tiamat#9131
all these things have to be enforced on Protocol layer, not on client, it would be so easy if it was on client


[24-Oct-18 07:15 AM] Mike#2447
Isn't computer science fun?  🙃


[24-Oct-18 07:16 AM] ATLAS#7218
Ok I guess I'll go through every peer


[24-Oct-18 07:16 AM] ATLAS#7218
That is the only option to make the leading one closer to me. So I can be in sync with them


[24-Oct-18 07:18 AM] Mike#2447
@ATLAS That's what I did.  Only after the 100 block, download I'm behind and can't catch up.  I have to think it's due to my latency being so much higher.


[24-Oct-18 07:19 AM] ATLAS#7218
So do you have the list of peers?


[24-Oct-18 07:20 AM] ATLAS#7218
My node even tried to mine a block when it was like 4 blocks behind. So only reason is that its peers were also fallen behind.


[24-Oct-18 07:21 AM] Mike#2447
Fixing this was supposed to be the purpose of the wildfire network, but it doesn't seem to be working.


[24-Oct-18 07:21 AM] ATLAS#7218
While most of the blocks are fallen behind so this is the opportunity to find the best peers


[24-Oct-18 07:21 AM] Mike#2447
arweave-samLast Friday at 12:58 PM
This would be my recommended peer list:

./arweave-server peer 52.56.119.91 peer 34.216.88.202 peer 54.93.54.173 peer 18.130.126.49 peer 13.231.142.3 peer 18.179.119.203 peer 54.159.24.25 peer 54.175.114.204 mine


[24-Oct-18 07:22 AM] tiamat#9131
somehow it does fix things, a few fast nodes are leading, only if we could be among them  


[24-Oct-18 07:26 AM] ATLAS#7218
Some of them are offline. But 18.179.119.203 seems to be good


[24-Oct-18 07:27 AM] ATLAS#7218
Finally catched up with the network


[24-Oct-18 07:27 AM] ATLAS#7218
ty


[24-Oct-18 07:28 AM] tiamat#9131

[24-Oct-18 07:29 AM] tiamat#9131
5 AR and I give you the best node

Hey @Mike

[24-Oct-18 07:47 AM] Mike#2447
Hi Sam!


[24-Oct-18 07:48 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Following up on something you mentioned earlier


[24-Oct-18 07:49 AM] arweave-sam#9630
When you join the network you download the 100 blocks, you find yourself behind by a few (this is normal) then you start to fork recover. But to be clear you are finding that you cannot fork recover fast enough to actually catch up with the tip?


[24-Oct-18 07:49 AM] Mike#2447
That's how it seems.


[24-Oct-18 07:50 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Ok, what hardware are you using?


[24-Oct-18 07:50 AM] Marcin#0065
It took me yesterday around 30 minutes to join and another 1 hours to fork around and finally catch up. Guess its normal


[24-Oct-18 07:51 AM] Mike#2447
LOL, like magic again, I've been behind for hours and now I'm suddenly current.


[24-Oct-18 07:51 AM] Marcin#0065
But once cought up the miner stay up to date, if no errors occur :D


[24-Oct-18 07:51 AM] arweave-sam#9630
No, our nodes will typically join in ~5 minutes, then fork recover for a couple of minutes


[24-Oct-18 07:51 AM] Mike#2447
My fastest machine is a Ryzen 2700.


[24-Oct-18 07:52 AM] arweave-sam#9630
So 8 cores with 2 threads each?


[24-Oct-18 07:52 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Also, how much memory?


[24-Oct-18 07:52 AM] Mike#2447
I've got the miners turned down to 8 from the 15 it should be using.


[24-Oct-18 07:52 AM] ATLAS#7218
I think its mainly because of the peers.


[24-Oct-18 07:53 AM] Mike#2447
8 GB of memory.


[24-Oct-18 07:53 AM] Marcin#0065
Is there a possibility to automaticly roam around the network and pick up peers with the same version only?


[24-Oct-18 07:53 AM] ATLAS#7218
If your peer are up to the height, it will recover fast. I first tried with the recommended peers given by sam and it took 10 minutes and didnt recover anything. So I found some decent peer and gave it as the only peer then it recovered in like a minute


[24-Oct-18 07:54 AM] arweave-sam#9630
With RC-4 after the first 100 you do 'roam' between known peers


[24-Oct-18 07:55 AM] ATLAS#7218
what is the known peers? does it go in depth?


[24-Oct-18 07:55 AM] ATLAS#7218
If so how far?


[24-Oct-18 07:55 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The peers that the node has been told about (by other peers), or found by itself


[24-Oct-18 07:56 AM] Marcin#0065
Some peers tale ages to send blocks, others give me some in seconds. Id like to limit out those slow ones :D


[24-Oct-18 07:56 AM] ATLAS#7218
*found by itself*


[24-Oct-18 07:56 AM] ATLAS#7218
what does it mean?


[24-Oct-18 07:57 AM] arweave-sam#9630
When it asks for peers of peers


[24-Oct-18 07:57 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Once every ~5 minutes


[24-Oct-18 07:57 AM] ATLAS#7218
When I try mining with 1 recommended peer given by you, the maximum peer is around 30


[24-Oct-18 07:58 AM] ATLAS#7218
I tried the peer I found, and now I have 80


[24-Oct-18 07:59 AM] ATLAS#7218
30 peer was the maximum after running for 2 days straight with no problem. If it asks peers of peers every 5 minutes, after some time it should have all the possible peers. Isnt it?


[24-Oct-18 07:59 AM] arweave-sam#9630
No, you rank peers by connectivity (latency and bandwidth) then drop the bad ones


[24-Oct-18 07:59 AM] arweave-sam#9630
More peers isn't necessarily better


[24-Oct-18 07:59 AM] ATLAS#7218
Yeah.


[24-Oct-18 07:59 AM] Mike#2447
Is there any trick to reducing latency?


[24-Oct-18 08:00 AM] ATLAS#7218
But all that 30 was fallen behind. So I couldnt recover. Thats when I decided to change the initial peer I give.


[24-Oct-18 08:00 AM] Mike#2447
If all the top miners are located in the same data center or even country, is that going to negatively affect the miner that's on a different continent?


[24-Oct-18 08:01 AM] ATLAS#7218
I think it is even better. Because you will have less ping with those data centers


[24-Oct-18 08:01 AM] ATLAS#7218
So you will be noticed faster when those data centers find a new block


[24-Oct-18 08:06 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I can see from our internal tooling that it is not the case that all 30 have seriously fallen behind at any point.

Yes, the data centers will distribute new blocks very quickly across the globe. We see, for example, that some Digital Ocean nodes in Europe prioritise some DO nodes in North America, which helps the network get the blocks around geographically quickly.


[24-Oct-18 08:07 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Also, somebody mentioned earlier that VB tend to be a little behind. IIRC, they only show blocks after they have been buried by at least one (maybe 2).

Not just less ping but also less distance which means faster upload/download speeds


[24-Oct-18 08:13 AM] Vilenarios#8742
We are dealing with next to no data here...


[24-Oct-18 08:13 AM] Vilenarios#8742
If there is any real usage of this network it must be geo distributes


[24-Oct-18 08:13 AM] ATLAS#7218
less distance correlates to propagation delay ~ ping


[24-Oct-18 08:13 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Maybe wildfire can incentivize that...


[24-Oct-18 08:14 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I guess the dapp developer can choose peers closer to their target audience? Idk


[24-Oct-18 08:15 AM] ATLAS#7218
@arweave-sam Is the list of peer ordered?


[24-Oct-18 08:21 AM] Marcin#0065
Is it better to pick one trusted peer or as much you can pickup?


[24-Oct-18 08:23 AM] Marcin#0065
And also, is there a website you can see what peers are connected and which version is running?
Sam, yoh showed once a graphocs of node in a picture visualised. The source for such graphics must be some kind of db or list of peers running. Why is not such list publicly opnlen to anybody? 
It wouldnt priotire anything and keep it decentralised. But seeing what peers are online, and how theirs stats are, would be handy.


[24-Oct-18 08:25 AM] Marcin#0065
I still dont know which peers to picl actually as trusted ones. Id like to pick my own peer lol xD


[24-Oct-18 08:28 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You can run the stats yourself using `app_net_explore`


[24-Oct-18 08:28 AM] arweave-sam#9630
It is all public, but we haven't made it as easy as we would like to generate the graphs, so we haven't given out the instructions.

@arweave-sam 
I find my benchmark results troubling.  It makes me believe the code may not optimized for AMD hardware.  Is this possible?

Intel 6600K (inside VM)  1.85 Mh/s
Intel G3220  1.23 Mh/s
AMD 2600X (overclocked to 4.1)  1.43 Mh/s
AMD 2700 (stock)  1.46 Mh/s
AMD 1090T  0.925 Mh/s


[24-Oct-18 10:00 AM] ATLAS#7218
It depends on the hashing algorithm I think


[24-Oct-18 10:01 AM] tiamat#9131
intels have hyperthreading


[24-Oct-18 10:01 AM] tiamat#9131
yes, they are faster but they don't work as good when all cores are used


[24-Oct-18 10:02 AM] tiamat#9131
on intel you can have 4 cores lets say and 8 vcpus


[24-Oct-18 10:03 AM] tiamat#9131
but when you start using your 5th vcpu, it will not work as good as the first 4


[24-Oct-18 10:03 AM] tiamat#9131
because it does not have a dedicated core


[24-Oct-18 10:03 AM] Mike#2447
The 2600 and 2700 both have multithreading as well.  The 2600 has 6 cores/12 threads and the 2700 has 8 cores/16 threads.


[24-Oct-18 10:04 AM] Mike#2447
I feel like my 6600K in a VM shouldn't be outperforming AMD's top of the line desktop parts.


[24-Oct-18 10:05 AM] tiamat#9131
it does not if the 2700 has 16 threads  and the 6600k only 8


[24-Oct-18 10:09 AM] Mike#2447
I suppose I can turn off multithreading and see how it compares.


[24-Oct-18 10:11 AM] tiamat#9131
on many operations the threads lock the core, so if you have 2 ht doing the same things they will split the resources


[24-Oct-18 10:11 AM] tiamat#9131
turning it off should not help overall, you will just have less vcpus but the speed of them will be more consistent


[24-Oct-18 10:43 AM] Marcin#0065
Ht gives an overall boost of 30% only.
Nothing can replace real cores :) threadrippers kill it


[24-Oct-18 10:45 AM] Marcin#0065
Doin a benchmark gives u a one core score only. U cant interpolate now and tell all sour thread will reach that hash power


[24-Oct-18 11:45 AM] Vilenarios#8742
@Dentechr which xenon? How much ram you got? You on Ubuntu or Windows? I’m documenting your hashrate so this info helps.


[24-Oct-18 11:49 AM] Mike#2447
If everyone posted their specs and benchmarks, it would be helpful.

I got a spreadsheet mike. I’ll post it when I get home.


[24-Oct-18 11:58 AM] Marcin#0065
1,4mhs on 1920x, 10k-20k latency when idle (sometimes 10-20 "No-k"), over 100k when mining


[24-Oct-18 11:59 AM] Marcin#0065
The less cores i put, the lower the latency while mining


[24-Oct-18 11:59 AM] tiamat#9131

[24-Oct-18 12:01 PM] tiamat#9131

[24-Oct-18 12:02 PM] Marcin#0065
Hmm weird


[24-Oct-18 12:02 PM] Marcin#0065
Maybe they are too busy mining? :D


[24-Oct-18 12:02 PM] tiamat#9131
haha


[24-Oct-18 12:21 PM] Mike#2447
So my 2700 seemed to have mined it's first block moments ago.  69534.  It showed up on VB and I received the reward.  Then old aE1A comes along and rewrites the front page of VB so that they have mined the last 8 blocks, including the one I had previously mined.  This super fishy.


[24-Oct-18 12:22 PM] Mike#2447
My reward is still in the wallet, but will that disappear as well?


[24-Oct-18 12:23 PM] tiamat#9131

[24-Oct-18 12:23 PM] tiamat#9131
on that block


[24-Oct-18 12:24 PM] Marcin#0065
Coz aE1A has more swag i think. ;)


[24-Oct-18 12:25 PM] Marcin#0065
No sry. Its really weird what u describe.


[24-Oct-18 12:25 PM] Mike#2447
That was it.  For me it shows aE1A having mined blocks 96532 - 69539.


[24-Oct-18 12:25 PM] Marcin#0065
Material for rumors :D


[24-Oct-18 12:26 PM] Mike#2447
I have both blocks in my blocks folder, but why would VB change it's mind after having already posted the info.


[24-Oct-18 12:26 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Hmmm, I think VB themselves appeared to have just fallen behind


[24-Oct-18 12:27 PM] arweave-sam#9630
VB runs a node like anyone else -- they fork recover like our nodes do too


[24-Oct-18 12:27 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Did you end up FRing away from the fork, Mike?


[24-Oct-18 12:28 PM] Mike#2447
All the peers I check show 0 balance at that address, although VB continues to show 7.2349415195 AR.


[24-Oct-18 12:28 PM] arweave-sam#9630
That does sound broken


[24-Oct-18 12:29 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Please can you DM me the address so I can bring it to their attention?


[24-Oct-18 12:29 PM] arweave-sam#9630

[24-Oct-18 12:32 PM] Mike#2447
What is driving the network consensus?  Who's to say that I wasn't main chain and they forked, but then the big miner comes along and says "Nope, we're going this way instead."


[24-Oct-18 12:33 PM] tiamat#9131
VB has buggy wallet balances, I think they don't update well from forks


[24-Oct-18 12:33 PM] Mike#2447
I wonder if the BTC developers had these experiences during their early time.


[24-Oct-18 12:34 PM] tiamat#9131
like if there are more blocks on the same height they randomly pick


[24-Oct-18 12:34 PM] tiamat#9131
or something


[24-Oct-18 12:34 PM] arweave-sam#9630
No


[24-Oct-18 12:34 PM] arweave-sam#9630
If they are on the same height and diff, they always choose the one they saw first


[24-Oct-18 12:35 PM] arweave-sam#9630
('saw' here meaning were sent a block shadow for)


[24-Oct-18 12:35 PM] tiamat#9131
well, they have wrong balance on KYi-WkdbVo92pJVTZ4MzM7l1b_WB_BlZXNOXKG4ZcME and I can show you another example if you wish


[24-Oct-18 12:35 PM] Mike#2447
Who is "they"?  VB?


[24-Oct-18 12:36 PM] tiamat#9131
VB


[24-Oct-18 12:36 PM] Vilenarios#8742
So if I mine a new block successfully then I can start mining the next one before anyone else. Would this be why we see streaks of successful block mining?


[24-Oct-18 12:36 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Sorry, I was talking about consensus, not VB


[24-Oct-18 12:36 PM] arweave-sam#9630
If any node is sent two valid blocks at height N+1, it always adopts the first it received


[24-Oct-18 12:36 PM] tiamat#9131
so VB either does not sync their web DB with their node or they are buggy when there are more blocks saved for the same height


[24-Oct-18 12:37 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It is quite possibly the latter, @tiamat


[24-Oct-18 12:38 PM] arweave-sam#9630
> I wonder if the BTC developers had these experiences during their early time.

@Mike I recently went back and read some of the early BTC release notes. Indeed they did. Even 18 months in they were issuing fixes like 'Non-standard transactions accepted on testnet' and 'move may take account balances negative'


[24-Oct-18 12:38 PM] tiamat#9131
@Mike you wonder about BTC? I tell you only projects that use ERC20 and no product don't have issues  


[24-Oct-18 12:38 PM] Mike#2447
This seems to go back to my comment about having some miners in the same location driving consensus, while miners far away are out of luck due to latency.


[24-Oct-18 12:38 PM] arweave-sam#9630
ETH was the same, from what I hear


[24-Oct-18 12:39 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Thank you all for your patience while the node software matures.


[24-Oct-18 12:40 PM] Mike#2447
Thank you for interacting with the community.


[24-Oct-18 12:45 PM] tiamat#9131
Maybe a faster fork recovery would be good, I understand some nodes should be delayed when they keep asking for old nodes, but when there is a fork and some part of the network is 3 blocks ahead, things should happen much faster


[24-Oct-18 12:45 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Indeed


[24-Oct-18 12:46 PM] arweave-sam#9630
There are quite a few performance related fixes we have in the works which will speed up block propagation and fork recovery


[24-Oct-18 01:27 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Regarding VB: The issue was a corner case with new wallets that are created through mining, show up in the wallet list for a while, then are removed. The instance is fixed and the class of instances should not recur.


[24-Oct-18 01:30 PM] Mike#2447
LOL my wallet was fixed.  Great.


[24-Oct-18 01:31 PM] Mike#2447

just let the client run and it will download blocks


[24-Oct-18 09:35 PM] patrick#8648
and sometimes youll be able to mine. You'll only be able to mine *all the time* when you have 100% of the blockes

But the download is slow

To put it simply, when you don't have much blocks, you will see that message often. After a few days, when you have a lot of blocks, it will mine more intensively

Everything is okay.
Your computer didnt start mining, because u dont have many blocks i think. The more blocks you have, the more often the computer starts mining

@ATLAS


[25-Oct-18 04:34 AM] Marcin#0065
U dont need a minimum number. Before next block mining a random block (so called "recall block") is chosen. If u have that recall block in ur folder, ur "allowed" to mine


[25-Oct-18 04:38 AM] awkweird#6550

@awkweird If you go to http://127.0.0.1:1984/info while your node is running you can see hw many blocks you have

Did it continue correctly after that message? If so, it is not a concern

Is there any other way to give multiple peers easily?


[25-Oct-18 08:32 AM] ATLAS#7218
@yemboy I think it just means that you have received external block and going to gossip it


[25-Oct-18 08:53 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@ATLAS other than the `peer A peer B peer C` on the command line, you mean?

Also the fork process


[25-Oct-18 10:53 AM] arweave-sam#9630

[25-Oct-18 12:29 PM] ATLAS#7218
@arweave-sam it doesn't 'remember' the previous WF scores after restart right?


[25-Oct-18 12:31 PM] ATLAS#7218
Isn't it better if it saves the previous instances peers and their relative WF scores so it can load them on restart?


[25-Oct-18 02:32 PM] Vilenarios#8742
So the best WF score is for the node with highest continual uptime?


[25-Oct-18 08:25 PM] ATLAS#7218
I think you misunderstood my question. Upon restarting arweave-server, it seems to lose all informations about its peers including their WF score. So I asked if its better to save them locally and load it.

@awkweird do you have your port 1984 open to the public?

nice infographic, but I my thoughts are on the following: with no pools to mine, who's going to claim the rewards? Most likely people with nice servers and the like, not the amateur miner o the likes


[26-Oct-18 06:13 AM] Silkapil#1153
who's going to compete with people that runs dual xeons, etc.?


[26-Oct-18 06:14 AM] ATLAS#7218
TRIPLE XEONS


[26-Oct-18 06:15 AM] Silkapil#1153
yeah I'm ordering some Intel KNL now


[26-Oct-18 06:15 AM] Silkapil#1153
I'll put them under the bed, you know, there's plenty of room there


[26-Oct-18 06:16 AM] Silkapil#1153
and I'll be cozy on winter


[26-Oct-18 06:24 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Intel knl?


[26-Oct-18 06:27 AM] Silkapil#1153
xeon phi


[26-Oct-18 06:36 AM] Vilenarios#8742
The coprocessor boards?

Pretty heavy duty...


[26-Oct-18 07:03 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Overkill for a web server IMO but looks like a fun piece of hardware to mess with prolly gets some crazy hash


[26-Oct-18 07:53 AM] vveljk#9869
Hi evryone!!!


[26-Oct-18 07:53 AM] vveljk#9869
I have few simple questions since I am thinking to start mining!!!


[26-Oct-18 07:53 AM] vveljk#9869
 


[26-Oct-18 07:54 AM] vveljk#9869
What is the reasonable space to offer, how much cores and what bandwith is OK?


[26-Oct-18 07:59 AM] Vilenarios#8742
The blockweave right now is less than 20gb but storage is key.


[26-Oct-18 07:59 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I’d go with 8TB 7200k drives


[26-Oct-18 07:59 AM] vveljk#9869
OK


[26-Oct-18 08:00 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Or just start with OS SSD drive and buy other HDs later


[26-Oct-18 08:00 AM] vveljk#9869
so we all store same data from all users?


[26-Oct-18 08:00 AM] vveljk#9869
or is there a split between miners?


[26-Oct-18 08:00 AM] vveljk#9869
at the moment max I can offer is 1TB


[26-Oct-18 08:01 AM] vveljk#9869
bandwith I have is 100/100 Mbit, but would like to lock it to 50/50


[26-Oct-18 08:01 AM] vveljk#9869
Is 50/50 still OK to offer?

[26-Oct-18 08:06 AM] vveljk#9869
just one more question....how many CPU cores should I give to vritual


[26-Oct-18 08:06 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@vveljk That config seems fine


[26-Oct-18 08:06 AM] arweave-sam#9630
More cores the better


[26-Oct-18 08:06 AM] vveljk#9869
I will use our server in company and most of 16 cores are doing nothing...


[26-Oct-18 08:06 AM] vveljk#9869
the same goes for bandwith and storage  


[26-Oct-18 08:06 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Nice!  


[26-Oct-18 08:07 AM] vveljk#9869
So first step is to install Ubuntu?


[26-Oct-18 08:07 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I would set `max_miners N` on the command line, where N is the number of cores you would like to use minus 2 or 3


[26-Oct-18 08:07 AM] vveljk#9869
than I proceed with the manual I got on email


[26-Oct-18 08:07 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yes


[26-Oct-18 08:07 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Just installing Ubuntu and running the install.sh script should be enough


[26-Oct-18 08:10 AM] vveljk#9869
Is it important to have as many cores as possible or is it OK to offer just 2 cores for mining?


[26-Oct-18 08:10 AM] vveljk#9869
is there any diference if I give more cores?


[26-Oct-18 08:23 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Max miners seems to require minus 4 at least to have a stable network latency


[26-Oct-18 08:23 AM] Vilenarios#8742
You want as many cores


[26-Oct-18 08:23 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Because when it comes time to mine you need that hash power


[26-Oct-18 08:23 AM] Vilenarios#8742
BUT you dont want to overload your web server components....


[26-Oct-18 08:24 AM] vveljk#9869
what do you mean by minus is that like -4  


[26-Oct-18 08:24 AM] vveljk#9869
minus is something negative  


[26-Oct-18 08:24 AM] Vilenarios#8742
i mean like if i have 16 cores, ill do max_miners 12


[26-Oct-18 08:24 AM] vveljk#9869
aha ok


[26-Oct-18 08:24 AM] vveljk#9869
I can not share all 166 cores, but I will give 8 cores


[26-Oct-18 08:25 AM] vveljk#9869
so I will give 4 cores for mining


[26-Oct-18 08:25 AM] vveljk#9869
all 16 cores


[26-Oct-18 08:25 AM] vveljk#9869
sorry for mistyping  


[26-Oct-18 08:50 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Unfortunately, the max_miners doesnt seem to actually limit cores, rather limits overall Erlang usage of your compute power.  Or at least thats what it seems like it does.  Its not like i see 12 cores pegged at 100% and 4 cores just chilling... its more like all cores at 90ish percent


[26-Oct-18 08:50 AM] vveljk#9869
no problem in my case, because I will deploy virtual machine just for that reason


[26-Oct-18 08:51 AM] vveljk#9869
so I don't mind if all cores are used at 90%


[26-Oct-18 09:06 AM] vveljk#9869
one more question  


[26-Oct-18 09:07 AM] vveljk#9869
I plan to make iscsi connection to VmWare esxi and than use this drive for Ubuntu VM


[26-Oct-18 09:07 AM] vveljk#9869
what happens in case my NAS restarts and iSCSI connection is lost


[26-Oct-18 09:08 AM] vveljk#9869
will database become corrupted?


[26-Oct-18 09:22 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Nah


[26-Oct-18 09:22 AM] Vilenarios#8742
You can force stop the miner without issues


[26-Oct-18 09:22 AM] Vilenarios#8742
the blocks are very tiny


[26-Oct-18 09:47 AM] tiamat#9131
but having a block, means you need  to have the associated tx as well, where the uploads are actually stored, not just the tiny blocks, is this correct @arweave-sam  ?


[26-Oct-18 09:51 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yes


[26-Oct-18 09:51 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You need the block structure itself, its wallet list and the associated transactions


[26-Oct-18 10:33 AM] Vilenarios#8742
The only issue I’ve seen with corrupting blocks is if you try to use compression.


[26-Oct-18 11:25 AM] awkweird#6550
What is the configuration if not using a static ip?

what am I doing wrong?  


[26-Oct-18 11:36 AM] vveljk#9869
I guess the weekdn started


[26-Oct-18 11:36 AM] vveljk#9869
okay....monday it is then  


[26-Oct-18 11:36 AM] vveljk#9869
wish you all nice weekend


[26-Oct-18 12:48 PM] Goldfinger#4647
try restart your pc, I have had same problem last week, now started fine


[26-Oct-18 01:29 PM] vveljk#9869
I reinstalled machine and it started, but I don't see any network traffic as I don't see any CPU usage


[26-Oct-18 01:29 PM] vveljk#9869
I also did dst-nat for port 1984 and forward it to my machine


[26-Oct-18 01:30 PM] Vilenarios#8742
can you browse to your public IP over port 1984?


[26-Oct-18 01:31 PM] vveljk#9869
should there be all the time some new text in console or is that OK that it stopped with yes


[26-Oct-18 01:31 PM] vveljk#9869
ups


[26-Oct-18 01:31 PM] vveljk#9869
sorry


[26-Oct-18 01:31 PM] vveljk#9869
wanted to write first something


[26-Oct-18 01:32 PM] vveljk#9869
but than entered yes as answer at the end  


[26-Oct-18 01:32 PM] vveljk#9869
so yes I can browse to public IP and port 1984


[26-Oct-18 01:32 PM] vveljk#9869
I get following response: {"network":"arweave.N.1","version":3,"release":11,"height":0,"current":"not_joined","blocks":0,"peers":82,"queue_length":0,"node_state_latency":140}


[26-Oct-18 01:33 PM] Vilenarios#8742
ya thats expected


[26-Oct-18 01:33 PM] Vilenarios#8742
the console sometimes wont show info for a while


[26-Oct-18 01:33 PM] vveljk#9869
any reason why it is not syncing?


[26-Oct-18 01:33 PM] vveljk#9869
ok


[26-Oct-18 01:33 PM] Vilenarios#8742
you can open a second console, go into your arweave directory, and do a "make log"


[26-Oct-18 01:33 PM] vveljk#9869
when I do "make log" I get some errors


[26-Oct-18 01:34 PM] Vilenarios#8742
hmm


[26-Oct-18 01:34 PM] Vilenarios#8742
what errors?


[26-Oct-18 01:37 PM] vveljk#9869

this is completely freshly installed ubuntu


[26-Oct-18 01:40 PM] vveljk#9869
all I did is sudo ./install.sh


[26-Oct-18 01:41 PM] vveljk#9869
and than I run arweave-server with all the peers and mine wallet parameter and max_miners parameter


[26-Oct-18 01:56 PM] Vilenarios#8742
take out all the peers


[26-Oct-18 01:56 PM] Vilenarios#8742
and just try with like 52.56.119.91


[26-Oct-18 02:07 PM] vveljk#9869
ok


[26-Oct-18 02:08 PM] vveljk#9869
for stopping server I just do ctrl+c or is there some better way


[26-Oct-18 02:11 PM] vveljk#9869
looks like it is working now


[26-Oct-18 02:11 PM] vveljk#9869
I got now Joining the arweave network...  


[26-Oct-18 02:12 PM] vveljk#9869
and I already see some CPU usage and network transfers  


[26-Oct-18 02:13 PM] arweave-india#5075
Thanks @Vilenarios !


[26-Oct-18 02:20 PM] vveljk#9869
yes....thx Vilenarios


[26-Oct-18 02:23 PM] vveljk#9869
How do I know when it will be fully synced?


[26-Oct-18 02:24 PM] vveljk#9869
make log is working now  


[26-Oct-18 02:24 PM] vveljk#9869
niiiiiice  


[26-Oct-18 02:26 PM] vveljk#9869
how often are rewards distributed?


[26-Oct-18 02:28 PM] vveljk#9869
Sharing 8 cores of Xeon E5620, storage 1,5TB and bandwith 100/100Mbit (later will be 50/50Mbit)  


[26-Oct-18 02:28 PM] vveljk#9869
Hope I am helping the community  


[26-Oct-18 02:34 PM] vveljk#9869
All is working perfect now...thanks...wish you all nice weekend...


[26-Oct-18 02:44 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Nice spec, i would think that should be pretty good.  Rewards are distributed if you mine a block...


[26-Oct-18 02:46 PM] Vilenarios#8742
So maybe with that you could get a block or two a day? I dunno really... its hard to measure


[26-Oct-18 02:48 PM] vveljk#9869
Nice...hope to see some block soon  


[26-Oct-18 02:48 PM] Vilenarios#8742
What is your benchmark for that?


[26-Oct-18 02:48 PM] vveljk#9869
can I run it now while it is running?


[26-Oct-18 02:48 PM] Vilenarios#8742
no i wouldnt


[26-Oct-18 02:48 PM] Vilenarios#8742
do it another time


[26-Oct-18 02:48 PM] vveljk#9869
okey


[26-Oct-18 02:48 PM] Vilenarios#8742
dont stop now that you joined the weave  


[26-Oct-18 02:48 PM] vveljk#9869
for today I just want to hang out with my better half  


[26-Oct-18 02:49 PM] vveljk#9869
I will check it on monday or when I will need some maintenance  


[26-Oct-18 02:49 PM] vveljk#9869
thank you for support


[26-Oct-18 02:49 PM] vveljk#9869
cheers  


[26-Oct-18 02:49 PM] vveljk#9869
over and out  


[26-Oct-18 02:49 PM] Vilenarios#8742
your welcome


[27-Oct-18 03:52 AM] ATLAS#7218
Is there a way to blacklist blocks from downloading?


[27-Oct-18 03:53 AM] ATLAS#7218
There should be right? In the future, we will have to prioritize blocks if the weave size becomes enormous


[27-Oct-18 04:19 AM] Vilenarios#8742
No idea baz. There is supposed to be a democratic content filtering process that we as miners should have...


[27-Oct-18 05:11 AM] yemboy#6783
With 20% blocks downloaded so far..what's a fair guesstimate of block you can mined daily with a lantency less than 50,000 and CPU benchmark of 1.6mhs


[27-Oct-18 05:11 AM] yemboy#6783
1 core only


[27-Oct-18 05:13 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Dunno... have you mined one yet?


[27-Oct-18 05:15 AM] Vilenarios#8742
i would think like one every few days, maybe one a week


[27-Oct-18 05:17 AM] yemboy#6783
Get like 1 per day now..two days running


[27-Oct-18 05:19 AM] Vilenarios#8742
nice   yeah i wish there was a better way to determine the rate


[27-Oct-18 05:19 AM] yemboy#6783
Looking forward to see if it wld increase in 4 days time when 100% block shld have been downloaded


[27-Oct-18 05:24 AM] Vilenarios#8742
whats your network connection? im having a hard time getting consistent sub 50k network latency


[27-Oct-18 05:27 AM] yemboy#6783
It's vps on digital ocean


[27-Oct-18 05:33 AM] Vilenarios#8742
and you are running ubuntu?


[27-Oct-18 05:42 AM] yemboy#6783
Yes 18.04


[27-Oct-18 05:42 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Hmm i wonder if Windows 10 w/ WSL has network latency disadvantages.


[27-Oct-18 05:50 AM] woombash#1763
@yemboy  you on that cpu optimized DO droplet ?


[27-Oct-18 05:52 AM] yemboy#6783
@woombash don't have access to that yet. It's the 8GB, 4vcpu


[27-Oct-18 05:52 AM] Vilenarios#8742
how much does the VPS you are running cost per month?


[27-Oct-18 05:56 AM] yemboy#6783
$40


[27-Oct-18 06:04 AM] Vilenarios#8742
ugh i dont understand why my 1 internal node would ever be behind the block height of my dmz node.  less than 1 ms latency between the two, yet they get out of sync


[27-Oct-18 06:13 AM] Mike#2447
Is the internal node peered with other outside nodes or only the DMZ node?


[27-Oct-18 06:31 AM] Vilenarios#8742
only the dmz node, and its in polling


[27-Oct-18 06:46 AM] Mike#2447
Yeah, that doesn't make sense.


[27-Oct-18 06:56 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Nope sure doesn’t. I can’t figure it out. Not sure if it’s too much load on cpu or something else.


[27-Oct-18 06:56 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Maybe the dmz node is just a watcher and doesn’t mine. And only the internal nodes mine.


[27-Oct-18 07:11 AM] Mike#2447
I've tried that arrangement and it wasn't different for me whether the DMZ node was mining or not.  The latency was lower when it wasn't mining, but I still had sync issues.


[27-Oct-18 07:13 AM] Vilenarios#8742
yeah im thinking i should just run everything with all cores, instead of limiting with max_miners


[27-Oct-18 07:13 AM] Vilenarios#8742
since its got high latency regardless during mining and forks


[27-Oct-18 07:27 AM] Mike#2447
Occasionally I get this error and while the CPU is still working, the system stops downloading blocks.

[27-Oct-18 08:19 AM] vveljk#9869
Hi ya all....


[27-Oct-18 08:19 AM] vveljk#9869
I got one simple question  


[27-Oct-18 08:19 AM] vveljk#9869
Where can I check if I have mined or how many blocks have I already mined?


[27-Oct-18 08:20 AM] vveljk#9869
I already see some balance on my wallet  


[27-Oct-18 08:20 AM] vveljk#9869
so I guess I already mined some blocks  


[27-Oct-18 08:22 AM] Mike#2447
I would like to see ViewBlock updates to include this information with the address stats.  I'm not aware of a way to view all blocks mined by an address.


[27-Oct-18 10:21 AM] ATLAS#7218
@Vilenarios Probably your DMZ is not prioritizing your internal node because it has low WF score compared to others due to its dynamic IP or any other reasons.


[27-Oct-18 10:36 AM] Vilenarios#8742
hmm i hadnt considered WF score for the internal nodes...


[27-Oct-18 10:36 AM] Vilenarios#8742
i have 2 internal nodes, 1 is totally fine, and the other is always behind it seems


[27-Oct-18 10:39 AM] ATLAS#7218
Your internal nodes have only 1 peer right?


[27-Oct-18 10:40 AM] ATLAS#7218
Maybe make the 2 internal node peer each other


[27-Oct-18 10:41 AM] ATLAS#7218
1 good internal node will have only 2 peers so WF scores won't matter and it can help syncing the lagging one.


[27-Oct-18 10:44 AM] ATLAS#7218
It seems they don't share storage. If so what's the advantage of having a DMZ?


[27-Oct-18 10:44 AM] ATLAS#7218
Isn't it better if your internal is also connected to other peers?


[27-Oct-18 10:48 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Well I have 3 miners but only one public IP


[27-Oct-18 10:48 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Good point, I should peer the two internals with each other as well as my dmz.


[27-Oct-18 10:50 AM] Vilenarios#8742
If this isn’t necessary then I’m open to different configs. I just though I had to put my internal nodes as “polling” and then peer them to my dmz node which has port forwarding externally on 1984


[27-Oct-18 10:50 AM] ATLAS#7218
Why do they have dynamic ips?


[27-Oct-18 10:50 AM] ATLAS#7218
They dont have local network?


[27-Oct-18 10:51 AM] ATLAS#7218
I mean the internals


[27-Oct-18 10:51 AM] Vilenarios#8742
They do. They don’t have dynamic ips they are static.


[27-Oct-18 10:51 AM] ATLAS#7218
Ah ok. Misunderstood.


[27-Oct-18 10:53 AM] ATLAS#7218
What does polling mode do?


[27-Oct-18 10:55 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Idk exactly but I think you need it if you can’t do 1984 port forwarding.

[27-Oct-18 11:57 AM] tiamat#9131
@arweave-sam what is with hash_lists folder? can we regenerate it?


[27-Oct-18 12:49 PM] ATLAS#7218
It seems my port 1984 is open. But it has dynamic ip and running on polling mode. log keeps showing could_not_retrieve_joining_block


[27-Oct-18 12:49 PM] ATLAS#7218
How do I fix it?


[27-Oct-18 03:45 PM] yemboy#6783
Looks like the more blocks you have downloaded..more attempt you have at mining


[27-Oct-18 03:50 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Yes - every new block has a reference to an existing block


[27-Oct-18 03:50 PM] Vilenarios#8742
if you dont have that existing block, you cant mine


[27-Oct-18 04:03 PM] yemboy#6783
Is it random or reference previous block?


[27-Oct-18 04:03 PM] Vilenarios#8742
random


[27-Oct-18 04:45 PM] Mike#2447
This the foundation of Arweave.  Miners are incentivised to hold as much data (blocks) as possible.


[27-Oct-18 04:52 PM] Silkapil#1153
Miners with low/mid-end cpus will desist from mining, when they see that they get no reward at all


[27-Oct-18 04:53 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Until someone has mastered the art of providing a shared storage pool with split payments


[27-Oct-18 04:53 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Similar to other mining pools.


[27-Oct-18 04:53 PM] Silkapil#1153
except that this one also holds data, not like the others


[27-Oct-18 04:53 PM] Silkapil#1153
if someone finds the way to pool that as well, then awesome


[27-Oct-18 08:47 PM] Vilenarios#8742
ugh why does my make log auto scroll on some terminals but not others... sooo frustrating


[27-Oct-18 08:50 PM] ATLAS#7218
wdym autoscroll?


[27-Oct-18 08:50 PM] ATLAS#7218
always at the bottom?


[27-Oct-18 08:50 PM] Vilenarios#8742
yeah, like if i do make log on some terminals, as the log gets written, the terminal updates


[27-Oct-18 08:51 PM] Vilenarios#8742
other ones, make log just spits out a few lines and thats it.  i have to ctrl+c then do make log again to view it


[27-Oct-18 08:51 PM] ATLAS#7218
yeah. It happens occasionally to me alsi


[27-Oct-18 08:51 PM] Vilenarios#8742
very odd


[27-Oct-18 08:52 PM] ATLAS#7218
Make log stops updating so I wonder what happened and remake it. Then everything shows up


[28-Oct-18 02:14 AM] yemboy#6783
Is previous block download progressive or gets downloaded randomly?


[28-Oct-18 02:15 AM] yemboy#6783
If my blocks downloaded is 20,000 : does that mean I have downloaded block 1 - 20,000?


[28-Oct-18 02:18 AM] ATLAS#7218
No.


[28-Oct-18 02:47 AM] yemboy#6783
Means I have randomly downloaded 20,000 blocks


[28-Oct-18 03:02 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Well I think I’ve nearly about given up trying to get a “polling” miner at the same block height as a non-polling miner.


[28-Oct-18 07:51 AM] codybartfast#9308
@Mike , re seeing mining 'transactions' in ViewBlock,  I did ask in their Telegram channel about this when they first launched and they said it was planned, but  I didn't ask when.


[28-Oct-18 07:54 AM] codybartfast#9308
@Vilenarios , re the log file not following I've had that problem with ubuntu 18.4 on WSL.  I replace the `tail -f` command with `less +F` and that works for me.


[28-Oct-18 07:54 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Thank you cody

[28-Oct-18 08:32 PM] Bill#8070
what is the problem?


[28-Oct-18 08:32 PM] patrick#8648
your port


[28-Oct-18 08:33 PM] patrick#8648
it's already used by something


[28-Oct-18 08:33 PM] patrick#8648
which i assume is another arweave server instance


[28-Oct-18 08:33 PM] patrick#8648
look at your processes


[28-Oct-18 08:33 PM] patrick#8648
eaddrinuse tells u it's a port issue


[28-Oct-18 08:34 PM] Bill#8070
how to solve that? restart?


[28-Oct-18 08:34 PM] patrick#8648
well it means you have another arweave server running. Do you have a process running in one of your terminals?


[28-Oct-18 08:34 PM] patrick#8648
Did you make a service and it is running in the background?


[28-Oct-18 08:35 PM] patrick#8648
if so try to find the process id -- and if you want to kill it go ahead


[28-Oct-18 08:36 PM] patrick#8648
restarting would work, but that assumes you don't have arweave running on bootup (which i do)


[28-Oct-18 08:36 PM] Bill#8070
how to check?


[28-Oct-18 08:36 PM] patrick#8648

?


[28-Oct-18 08:47 PM] patrick#8648
run this `sudo netstat -ntlp | grep 1984`


[28-Oct-18 08:48 PM] patrick#8648
it should give you something like `15968/beam.smp`


[28-Oct-18 08:48 PM] patrick#8648
that number is the PID (process id)


[28-Oct-18 08:48 PM] patrick#8648
you can call `kill` on that pid


[28-Oct-18 08:48 PM] patrick#8648
and it will stop the program


[28-Oct-18 08:48 PM] Bill#8070
2000/beam.smp


[28-Oct-18 08:49 PM] patrick#8648
ok now `sudo kill 2000`


[28-Oct-18 08:54 PM] Bill#8070
then restart the miner?


[28-Oct-18 08:54 PM] patrick#8648
ya


[28-Oct-18 08:55 PM] patrick#8648
there shouldnt be any problems now


[28-Oct-18 08:56 PM] Bill#8070
What's the normal mining log?


[28-Oct-18 08:56 PM] patrick#8648
in another session (in the same directory) write `make log`

[28-Oct-18 08:58 PM] Bill#8070
fine?


[28-Oct-18 08:59 PM] patrick#8648
ya it's ok, it's an erlang warning


[28-Oct-18 09:00 PM] Bill#8070
how long will mine a block


[28-Oct-18 09:00 PM] Bill#8070
like with 8T


[28-Oct-18 09:00 PM] patrick#8648
well at first you need blocks to be able to mine


[28-Oct-18 09:00 PM] patrick#8648
called "recall blocks"


[28-Oct-18 09:01 PM] patrick#8648
so right now there are about 70K blocks


[28-Oct-18 09:01 PM] patrick#8648
takes about 10 days to download all of them


[28-Oct-18 09:01 PM] patrick#8648
the more nblocks you have (and higher hashrate) the higher chance you have to mine


[28-Oct-18 09:01 PM] Bill#8070
how can I check how many blocks I have download


[28-Oct-18 09:02 PM] patrick#8648
`curl 127.0.0.1:1984`


[28-Oct-18 09:02 PM] patrick#8648
it will give you a blocks: XXX


[28-Oct-18 09:02 PM] patrick#8648
that's how many you have


[28-Oct-18 09:09 PM] Bill#8070

[28-Oct-18 09:19 PM] Bill#8070
How to update?


[28-Oct-18 09:19 PM] ATLAS#7218
git fetch; git checkout N.1.5.0.0-RC-4


[28-Oct-18 09:19 PM] ATLAS#7218
do it after you cd into arweave folder


[28-Oct-18 09:20 PM] Bill#8070
Ok


[28-Oct-18 09:21 PM] Bill#8070
Does it mean fine if the blocks increase?


[28-Oct-18 09:22 PM] ATLAS#7218
Yeah it should increase

It is running very smooth except this part. It restarts on its own so I have no problem with it but I think it should be fixed if its possible.

Hi ya folks....


[29-Oct-18 03:01 AM] vveljk#9869
Good morning  


[29-Oct-18 03:01 AM] vveljk#9869
can anyone tell if that is good benchmark result: I got 700k h/s


[29-Oct-18 03:31 AM] WILL#5685
Do I need to sync all the blocks in order to mine?  @ATLAS


[29-Oct-18 03:41 AM] ATLAS#7218
No.


[29-Oct-18 03:42 AM] ATLAS#7218
For example, if you have 20% of the block, you have 20% chance of starting to mine the next block


[29-Oct-18 03:44 AM] ATLAS#7218
@vveljk Depends on your number of threads. If you have all the blocks and run with 12 threads, each with 700k,you will get around 14AR per day. *I think*.


[29-Oct-18 03:52 AM] ATLAS#7218
Benchmarking is done on 1 thread at a time. So it doesn't really show the performance when all the threads are working. So it will vary a lot depending on the cpu you using


[29-Oct-18 03:57 AM] yemboy#6783
That's per core


[29-Oct-18 04:09 AM] WILL#5685
[root@node241 ~]# ll /data/arweave/arweave/blocks/|wc -l

[29-Oct-18 04:11 AM] WILL#5685
Is the number of blocks I have synced in 17681?


[29-Oct-18 04:11 AM] WILL#5685
@ATLAS


[29-Oct-18 04:15 AM] ATLAS#7218
There might be duplicate blocks so a bit less than that


[29-Oct-18 04:16 AM] ATLAS#7218
@yemboy it only used 1 thread so I assumed its per thread. Not sure about it.


[29-Oct-18 04:16 AM] ATLAS#7218
Shouldn't it use 2 threads if that was the case?


[29-Oct-18 05:05 AM] yemboy#6783
Is the max_miners a function of core or threads?

Hi guys,

`N.1.5.0.0-RC-5` is now out. You can update your miners by running `git fetch --all ; git checkout N.1.5.0.0-RC-5 ; git pull`.

Highlights from this release:
- New miner log that makes the progression through the three phases of Arweave mining clearer. This log also now monitors the node's connectivity, printing a warning if inbound communications halt.
- Misc network transfer performance improvements.

A special thanks goes to our community testers! @Marcin @Dentechr @Mike

I second that - thanks to everyone here also who has offered bug reports, feedback, asked your questions, and answered others' questions!


[29-Oct-18 06:23 AM] ATLAS#7218
@arweave-sam will there be release that makes wallet_lists smaller?


[29-Oct-18 06:25 AM] ATLAS#7218
And what is the git pull for? I need to merge with some branch?


[29-Oct-18 06:37 AM] arweave-sam#9630
> @arweave-sam will there be release that makes wallet_lists smaller?

@ATLAS Yes, After 2.0 wallet_lists older than 50 blocks will be optional to store


[29-Oct-18 06:41 AM] ATLAS#7218
What is the advantage of storing old wallet lists?


[29-Oct-18 06:43 AM] ATLAS#7218
Just my personal opinion. But if there was the `Accepted foreign block` log, the flow will look better. Now its just continuous Stage 1/3


[29-Oct-18 08:03 AM] vveljk#9869
@ATLAS Is there a way to set to have all the blocks?


[29-Oct-18 08:03 AM] vveljk#9869
I have 8 cores on this VM and I set max_miners 4


[29-Oct-18 08:03 AM] vveljk#9869
so I guess I am running 4 threads?


[29-Oct-18 08:06 AM] ATLAS#7218
afaik there is no such mode. But it is downloading in the background and its quite fast. And yes, you are using 4 threads

It will show that message each time mining the next block begins.  It can progress to stage 2 if you successfully mine a block and then stage 3 if that block is confirmed by the network.

Got all the miners updated.  Testing the new build now.  So glad the team puts out updates so fast!!


[29-Oct-18 10:05 AM] yemboy#6783
@Mike my observation...when I don't use max_miners...I don't see the stage 1/3 but when I use the max_miner flag...it shows that  and seems it's going to be at 1/3 till you successfully mine a block

@Vilenarios Yes, that's expected. It doesn't print the accepted message until 10 confirmations have passed. Should take at least 20 minutes.

Thank you for the answer Martin


[29-Oct-18 11:48 AM] arweave-martin#1169
So, if your miner doesn't produce a candidate block in time, then you won't see stage 2 nor stage 3.


[29-Oct-18 11:48 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Stage 1 is where the mining happens right? Aka most CPU usage


[29-Oct-18 11:49 AM] arweave-martin#1169
Correct


[29-Oct-18 12:04 PM] awkweird#6550

Np!


[29-Oct-18 12:05 PM] awkweird#6550
As for the reward


[29-Oct-18 12:05 PM] awkweird#6550
I've noticed that it usually come in 6 hours of period


[29-Oct-18 12:05 PM] awkweird#6550
Is this correct or its just randomly mined?


[29-Oct-18 12:06 PM] arweave-martin#1169
I don't know how this works. Maybe @arweave-india does?


[29-Oct-18 12:07 PM] arweave-india#5075
As far as I'm aware there's no set interval for rewards being collected or distributed (I think it's just instant* when you are successful), but I'll get an answer to this from Sam when he's available, or ask him to pop on here to clarify for you @awkweird

Edit: *apologies, not instant, but after set number of confirmations (10), but not every X hours for example


[29-Oct-18 12:12 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I believe the reward is granted after those 20 confirmations


[29-Oct-18 12:13 PM] Vilenarios#8742
So after you mine the block, it takes maybe 15-20 mins to get all the confirmations.  If that is successful, the reward should hit your wallet soon after that...


[29-Oct-18 12:19 PM] ATLAS#7218
@awkweird It's randomly mined.


[29-Oct-18 12:20 PM] ATLAS#7218
If you successfully find the properly hashed candidate block before anyone else and distribute across the network, you will get the reward.


[29-Oct-18 12:21 PM] ATLAS#7218
And of course, finding a properly hashed block is pure *luck* because of the randomness by sha384.


[29-Oct-18 12:23 PM] ATLAS#7218
@arweave-india @Vilenarios I believe he asked the interval he mines a block. Not time taken for reward to come after mining


[29-Oct-18 12:23 PM] ATLAS#7218
Viewblock will say you have received the block if it is on the same fork as you. In other words, when you find a candidate block, you have your reward in your *local* blockweave but its just not confirmed. So reward is actually immediately distributed.


[29-Oct-18 12:25 PM] arweave-india#5075
Ah okay, I may have misunderstood


[29-Oct-18 12:31 PM] awkweird#6550
Yes @ATLAS that was what i intended. Thanks for the answer.

Haha no probs - sorry I was a bit off base  


[29-Oct-18 12:35 PM] ATLAS#7218
@Vilenarios 20 confirmations is just the internal requirement by arweave-server to think that you *really* mined a block. Theoretically, it is possible to roll back and lose your reward even if the arweave server says you have mined it successfully.


[29-Oct-18 12:36 PM] ATLAS#7218
@arweave-sam please correct me if I'm wrong.


[29-Oct-18 12:40 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@ATLAS Basically right  


[29-Oct-18 12:41 PM] arweave-sam#9630
But it is 10 confirms before you get the message, not 20

I get only stage 1/3 and I never get 2/3 and 3/3


[29-Oct-18 01:58 PM] ATLAS#7218
Yeah. Mining a block is not that easy so usually you will only get 1/3


[29-Oct-18 01:59 PM] ATLAS#7218
If all your threads are mostly on 100% usage, better lower your max_miners to avoid falling behind.


[29-Oct-18 01:59 PM] vveljk#9869
so I will get stage 2/3 and 3/3 only when I find a block?

[29-Oct-18 02:00 PM] vveljk#9869
so I guess I should try with max_miners 4


[29-Oct-18 02:07 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I found taking off 6 cpus helped on my 24 core.


[29-Oct-18 02:13 PM] Dentechr#5213
I'm testing what the best amount of cores to use will be. Trying y0% of my available cores a.t.m.


[29-Oct-18 02:13 PM] vveljk#9869
I changed to max_miners 4 and I see that CPU usage is now better, but I still get only stage 1/3  


[29-Oct-18 02:13 PM] Dentechr#5213
60


[29-Oct-18 02:19 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Cant wait to see your results Dentechr.  Ive been doing similar testing.... been doing 6 under max cores.


[29-Oct-18 02:25 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Id like to see if your network latency changes at all depending on your CPU usage


[29-Oct-18 02:42 PM] vveljk#9869
even with max_miners set to 2 I don't get stage 2/3 and 3/3


[29-Oct-18 02:43 PM] vveljk#9869
is there anything else I can do to fix this issue?


[29-Oct-18 02:44 PM] Vilenarios#8742
its not an issue really, rather thats part of the mining process


[29-Oct-18 02:45 PM] Mike#2447
A single system with 2 miners may take days to find a block.


[29-Oct-18 02:46 PM] Mike#2447
Or longer!


[29-Oct-18 02:48 PM] vveljk#9869
okay so I will get stage 2/3 and 3/3 only when I find a block?


[29-Oct-18 02:48 PM] vveljk#9869
otherwise it stays only on stage 1/3?


[29-Oct-18 02:48 PM] Vilenarios#8742
when you find a block, it goes to stage 2


[29-Oct-18 02:49 PM] vveljk#9869
otherwise it stays on 1/3?


[29-Oct-18 02:50 PM] Vilenarios#8742
ya


[29-Oct-18 02:51 PM] Vilenarios#8742
stage 2 is when you distribute the block to the network, and if the network accepts, then its on to stage 3


[29-Oct-18 02:53 PM] vveljk#9869
@Mike# No problem, still better than doing nothing   


[29-Oct-18 02:59 PM] Mike#2447
For sure!  I would think max miners 4 would produce better results than 2, especially if you're on an 8 core system.  If it were me, I'd go with max miners 6.


[29-Oct-18 02:59 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Mike do you see network latency increase with more miners?


[29-Oct-18 03:00 PM] vveljk#9869
I already changed to 4 miners, but when I give 6 miners CPU usage of all 8 cores is almost all the time 100%


[29-Oct-18 03:00 PM] vveljk#9869
with 4 miners CPU usage is normal


[29-Oct-18 03:49 PM] chriscord#4741

[30-Oct-18 02:15 AM] Marcin#0065
Do normal people even have a chance against those big miners? Of course there are few blocks daily mined by the small ones, but its also visible, that most of the blocks are mined by very few adresses only. The whole idea od decentralization is kinda useless in that szenario. Any thoughts?


[30-Oct-18 02:19 AM] ATLAS#7218
Decentralization is not equality.


[30-Oct-18 02:20 AM] ATLAS#7218
We can't limit big miners from mining all the blocks. What is your proposed solution against this?


[30-Oct-18 02:21 AM] ATLAS#7218
Miner can run number of nodes without revealing that it's run by a single identity. So you would have to do KYC or something in that sense to introduce limitation.

Check viewblock. It will show correct result most of the time.


[30-Oct-18 04:02 AM] ATLAS#7218
Or it might be the case that someone else was already distributing its candidate block


[30-Oct-18 04:03 AM] vveljk#9869
I checked viewblock and got block not found


[30-Oct-18 04:04 AM] ATLAS#7218
Then probably it was rejected because of another candidate block.


[30-Oct-18 04:06 AM] vveljk#9869
OK so my computer was to slow when it distributed it?


[30-Oct-18 04:06 AM] vveljk#9869

[30-Oct-18 05:15 AM] tiamat#9131
actually that is what I did to fix


[30-Oct-18 05:16 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We can't do that network wide as there is always a possibility that there actually won't be a block for 90 minutes (although the likelihood is extremely low)


[30-Oct-18 05:16 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We will look into polling mode and see if there is an issue there


[30-Oct-18 05:16 AM] tiamat#9131
I got this on a machine running behind a bridge, I don't know why it happened because the network was working


[30-Oct-18 05:16 AM] tiamat#9131
I was not using polling


[30-Oct-18 05:17 AM] tiamat#9131
port 1984 opened, bridge doing its job


[30-Oct-18 05:17 AM] tiamat#9131
I'm curious where @Vilenarios got it, if it's the same situation


[30-Oct-18 05:42 AM] vveljk#9869
how much storage do you share?


[30-Oct-18 05:43 AM] vveljk#9869
I see that in only 2 days I got already 10GB of writen data


[30-Oct-18 05:43 AM] vveljk#9869
so if I share 1,5TB it won't last even half a year if we assume that number of users will grow  


[30-Oct-18 05:51 AM] Vilenarios#8742
@tiamat  I got the issue on 2 of my polling nodes on my own network


[30-Oct-18 05:51 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I also got the issue on my cloud node, which is NOT polling


[30-Oct-18 07:02 AM] ATLAS#7218
Polling mode definitely has some problems. I gave up and stopped mining on it.


[30-Oct-18 07:09 AM] Mike#2447
I also experienced the no blocks downloaded error on one of my polling nodes.


[30-Oct-18 07:10 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Glad I’m not the only one lol.


[30-Oct-18 07:12 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I’m confident the team can fix it.

Okay no problem we'll be happy to help. Please can you re-phrase what you mean by 'checking the instant hash'?


[30-Oct-18 08:12 AM] Vilenarios#8742
./arweave-server benchmark you mean @! [[$0m€B0dy


[30-Oct-18 08:12 AM] Vilenarios#8742
This will check cpu hash. It does not take into account the network or storage needs of the blockweave though.


[30-Oct-18 08:13 AM] arweave-india#5075
Thanks @Vilenarios  


[30-Oct-18 08:15 AM] ATLAS#7218
When I run on polling mode, it is always 1-2 blocks behind. No error but just always behind.


[30-Oct-18 08:16 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I’m about to either hit up everyone I know to run a miner or get a freakin business class isp


[30-Oct-18 08:17 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Forcing public IPs for every node... ultimate decentralization cept for big data centers.


[30-Oct-18 08:19 AM] tiamat#9131
when a node has to serve a file, it needs public IP


[30-Oct-18 08:19 AM] tiamat#9131
however, running nodes on different ports should be allowed


[30-Oct-18 08:19 AM] tiamat#9131
also SSL communication would be nice


[30-Oct-18 08:20 AM] arweave-sam#9630
+1 to each of those three, @tiamat


[30-Oct-18 08:20 AM] Mike#2447
More ports please!


[30-Oct-18 08:21 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Unfortunately, in order for nodes to properly serve files on request a public IP with port forwarding is necessarcy


[30-Oct-18 08:21 AM] arweave-sam#9630
*necessary


[30-Oct-18 08:21 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Multi-port and SSL support is on the roadmap


[30-Oct-18 09:03 AM] ivhturp#3325
By default, how many miners are started? Is there any advantage using max_miners. All the threads are 100% anyway in my case  


[30-Oct-18 09:05 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You will spawn an equal number of miners to threads by default


[30-Oct-18 09:05 AM] ivhturp#3325
Great, thanks @arweave-sam

[30-Oct-18 09:20 AM] Vilenarios#8742
@vveljk that means you don’t have the recall block. It’s normal and happens if your overall downloaded block count is low.


[30-Oct-18 09:20 AM] vveljk#9869
so through the time this will fix itself?


[30-Oct-18 09:20 AM] vveljk#9869
or should I fix something?


[30-Oct-18 09:20 AM] vveljk#9869
and of course thank you for help  


[30-Oct-18 09:21 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Nothing to fix as it’s working as intended. But yes it will go reduce as you get more blocks and totally go away once you have fully downloaded the block height.


[30-Oct-18 09:27 AM] vveljk#9869
@Vilenarios ok...thank you


[30-Oct-18 09:43 AM] ATLAS#7218
It seems it's impossible to mine with 4gigs of ram. Might as well write 8gb as minimum requirement.


[30-Oct-18 11:21 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I did some tests with 2cpu/4gb ram boxes. They mined, but constantly got that high memory watermark issue and would fall behind the block height.


[30-Oct-18 11:24 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yes, we have a few follower nodes with 4gb I think


[30-Oct-18 11:25 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Without mining they keep up ok, but it is clear that the machines are spending a lot of time managing/reclaiming memory.


[30-Oct-18 11:25 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We will add 8gb as 'recommended minimum' to the mining guide


[30-Oct-18 11:26 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Nodes that don’t mine are super fast on the network and have the lowest latency times.


[30-Oct-18 11:26 AM] Vilenarios#8742
So maybe a 4gb option would be good for an arweave dev node  or something.


[30-Oct-18 11:27 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep, 4gb should be fine for a local test node


[30-Oct-18 11:27 AM] arweave-sam#9630
But not really viable for mining


[30-Oct-18 11:33 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Has anyone else’s old block download slowed down?


[30-Oct-18 11:42 AM] ATLAS#7218
I tried to setup mining on 8 cores with 64gb of ram. Just because it was on polling mode, it was always behind 1-2 block. I hope you guys find the issue.


[30-Oct-18 12:25 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Baz I think Sam was saying that opening a port will always be necessary. Makes sense since we are web servers after all.


[30-Oct-18 12:25 PM] Vilenarios#8742
However he said in future version it may support custom ports


[30-Oct-18 12:26 PM] Vilenarios#8742
So you could do port forwarding across a range of your choosing.


[30-Oct-18 12:31 PM] nett8#3527
Which files do I need to copy to the new server from the old one? Blocks and wallet_lists will be enough?

Also txs.


[30-Oct-18 12:45 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Make sure your arweave-server is stopped in both locations or you may have mixed results.


[30-Oct-18 03:23 PM] Mike#2447
@Vilenarios Regarding download speed, I started a new instance today and in the last 6 hours have downloaded 1,700 blocks.  How does that compare with what you are seeing?


[30-Oct-18 06:44 PM] Vilenarios#8742
i will track the download rate tonight.  hopefully the miner survives the whole night

@Mike I downloaded 1400 blocks over 12 hours.  Not sure why its going so slow.  Ill keep monitoring the download rate


[31-Oct-18 07:11 AM] Mike#2447
@Vilenarios It's been about 22 hours for me and I have 5,256 blocks.  Although starting at 02:29:27 GMT I began receiving the "No foreign blocks received..." error every hour on the dot until I restarted the server this morning.  I'm not sure if that was actually affecting my download rate though, because when I look at the time stamp on the blocks, I had continued to receive them without interruption.


[31-Oct-18 07:13 AM] Vilenarios#8742
What kinda network do you have?  I have 100mb up/down


[31-Oct-18 07:13 AM] Mike#2447
@! [[$0m€B0dy I don't believe the network hashrate is published anywhere.  Or even obtainable for that matter.  The miners would have to publicly announced their hashrates, which would probably be a nice feature to have.


[31-Oct-18 07:13 AM] Vilenarios#8742
publically announce hashrate/bandwidth/storage capacity


[31-Oct-18 07:13 AM] Vilenarios#8742
so everyone would know the capacity of the blockweave


[31-Oct-18 07:14 AM] Mike#2447
I'd also like to see block finding paired to IP addresses.


[31-Oct-18 07:14 AM] Mike#2447
Not sure how that would work for polling miners though.


[31-Oct-18 07:14 AM] Vilenarios#8742
i have a feeling polling goes away and is replaced by multi-port


[31-Oct-18 07:15 AM] Vilenarios#8742
why blocks to ips?  id rather be as anonymous as i can


[31-Oct-18 07:15 AM] Mike#2447
I wonder if some sort of dynamic DNS could be incorporated.


[31-Oct-18 07:16 AM] rehash#3438
blocks paired to IPs would be a big concern to decentralization and privacy


[31-Oct-18 07:17 AM] Mike#2447
I'm looking for maximum transparency in the process.  Why would that affect decentralization?


[31-Oct-18 07:21 AM] Vilenarios#8742
valid point


[31-Oct-18 07:21 AM] Vilenarios#8742

[31-Oct-18 07:21 AM] rehash#3438
@Mike how about giving us your home address and telling us how much BTC you hold?


[31-Oct-18 07:22 AM] Vilenarios#8742
its enough my wife uses our home address for her business  


[31-Oct-18 07:22 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I think there are ways to be transparent with the network while keeping privacy


[31-Oct-18 07:23 AM] Vilenarios#8742
https with TLS 1.2 will also help this big time, and sam said they are working on that


[31-Oct-18 07:23 AM] Vilenarios#8742
or at least its on the roadmap or whatever


[31-Oct-18 07:29 AM] Mike#2447
I'm pondering the privacy implications of associating IPs with wallets with blocks.  I suppose wallets can always be changed if anonymity is somehow compromised, but IPs may prove more difficult.


[31-Oct-18 07:29 AM] Vilenarios#8742
DDOS the highest block producer on port 1984...


[31-Oct-18 07:30 AM] Mike#2447
That has me wondering about polling nodes.  If they're mining and storing the data, are they able to serve the data through a peer?


[31-Oct-18 07:30 AM] Vilenarios#8742
i dont really know enough about blockchain and Proof of Whatever mechanisms to really speak about security/privacy with it all though


[31-Oct-18 07:31 AM] Mike#2447
It's true the IPs are vulnerable to attack like that.


[31-Oct-18 07:39 AM] rehash#3438
DDOS is a big concern when there are pools and many miners


[31-Oct-18 07:39 AM] thegoat19#8424
whats the mining return per TB?


[31-Oct-18 07:40 AM] Vilenarios#8742
footballfan7, as of now, since the blockweave is small, storage size isnt much of a factor, its more about raw compute and network speed


[31-Oct-18 07:40 AM] rehash#3438
@thegoat19  3 factors involved: storage, computation, bandwidth


[31-Oct-18 07:40 AM] thegoat19#8424

@Mike Yes, we will be looking at this.

> i still dont want people to know my IP/wallet size

Yep, the way I see it at the moment nodes on the network should not be broadcasting any data that may identify them as a large miner of blocks. The main issue I am concerned about is that miners may keep large wallets on machine's that are publicly accessible via IP, making them a target for attack.


[31-Oct-18 11:10 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We could look at making your hash rate or mining address public optionally, at some point, but my guess is that if you had to manually turn it on people simply wouldn't use it


[31-Oct-18 11:10 AM] arweave-sam#9630
So it wouldn't be effective anyway


[31-Oct-18 11:17 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Sam do you envision some kind of load/tx test on the network?


[31-Oct-18 11:23 AM] rehash#3438
it's not only about wallet hacks, strong miners could become victims of DDOS attacks so others can get those rewards while down


[31-Oct-18 11:24 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@rehash Both are best avoided ;)

@Vilenarios Yes, sometime after 1.6 we will look at doing this on the main net, test nets until then.

[31-Oct-18 12:11 PM] Mike#2447
@! [[$0m€B0dy If you set your VB network adapter to bridged mode, it should pull a local IP from your router.  You should then be able to forward port 1984 to that IP or place the IP into your router's DMZ.

Why do some miners can dig into the mine continuously?


[31-Oct-18 11:39 PM] ATLAS#7218
Because when you mine one, you are the first one to start mining next one. With high hashrate, they go on a spree


[31-Oct-18 11:41 PM] WILL#5685
Should it be that as long as the miners involved in mining can get some mines?


[31-Oct-18 11:43 PM] WILL#5685
If you follow the current model, most of the mines are dug by a few miners.


[31-Oct-18 11:44 PM] WILL#5685
When I dig btc, although I only have a few machines, I can dig some mines at least every day.


[31-Oct-18 11:49 PM] ATLAS#7218
Probably because you were in a pool? Without a pool, rewards become very irregular especially when you have low hashrate.

How to limit CPU usage   ？ @arweave-sam


[01-Nov-18 04:31 AM] Vilenarios#8742
You can put “max_miners” parameter at the end


[01-Nov-18 04:33 AM] Vilenarios#8742
So if you have 24 cores you can do max_miners 18 and it should only use 18 cores. The results are varied though and most of the time it will still use 100% during hashing.


[01-Nov-18 04:59 AM] tiamat#9131
@Vilenarios that was not the case weeks ago, I wonder if it's because we have more nodes on the network or new version has some issue, beam.smp takes now more resources even when not mining


[01-Nov-18 06:41 AM] ivhturp#3325
I have tried with max_miners less than the number of cores. But all the cores are running at 100%. @tiamat yes, i remember you saying about using less number of max_miners than cores.


[01-Nov-18 08:24 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yes, the number of `max_miners` only controls the maximum number of cores that will be used for mining, but does not control the number of cores that will be used for book keeping/serving data to others. We are looking at potential solutions that allow miners to specify a total cap on cores used and will let you know once we add it.


[01-Nov-18 08:54 AM] vveljk#9869
Why do I often get only to stage 2/3...only finding candidates?


[01-Nov-18 08:54 AM] vveljk#9869
I checked my latency and it is around 40k


[01-Nov-18 08:55 AM] vveljk#9869
Which should be just fine as I know


[01-Nov-18 08:55 AM] vveljk#9869
Are my CPUs to slow and someone else finds it before me and post it network before I do?


[01-Nov-18 08:56 AM] vveljk#9869
Or is there something else?


[01-Nov-18 09:01 AM] Mike#2447
@vveljk  It's either lagging CPU or lagging network.  I have a Ryzen 2600X and 2700, both overclocked, yet only find a few blocks per day between the two of them because of network lag.  Unless some sort of speed bump is put into the system to keep the big miners from running ahead of the pack, I'm not sure what else can be done.


[01-Nov-18 09:12 AM] S A L M O N#5069
Hey @all would like to start mining with my 1TB SSD, 100mbit Computer. Unfortunately, it has only 4 CPU Cores and no GPU, do you think it is worth a shot?


[01-Nov-18 09:18 AM] vveljk#9869
CPU is not lagging since it isn't doing anything else


[01-Nov-18 09:18 AM] vveljk#9869
Only mining


[01-Nov-18 09:19 AM] vveljk#9869
I am checking Latency all the time and never goes above 40k and this as I know good result


[01-Nov-18 09:20 AM] vveljk#9869
Network also does not have problems since on this network I also have 6 rigs with total 48x RX570 and I don't have much stalled blocks


[01-Nov-18 09:20 AM] vveljk#9869
so there should be something else

[01-Nov-18 09:28 AM] vveljk#9869
what is the reason  to do mining if I don't get rewards  


[01-Nov-18 09:29 AM] vveljk#9869
If I don't resolve this issue in next few days I will most probably stop mining since I don't want costs only

[01-Nov-18 09:48 AM] ATLAS#7218
@beast I'm mining so i guess its possible


[01-Nov-18 09:48 AM] beast#6522
its it a high ram requirement then?


[01-Nov-18 09:48 AM] ATLAS#7218
@vveljk probably no. Network speed is much slower


[01-Nov-18 09:49 AM] ATLAS#7218
8gb is the minimum required


[01-Nov-18 09:49 AM] vveljk#9869
The point is that I am using iSCSI storage and that means that storage traffic goes over LAN


[01-Nov-18 09:49 AM] beast#6522
sounds like a GPU would have an atvantage if the ram is less than 12 gb


[01-Nov-18 09:50 AM] ATLAS#7218
Not sure. SHA384 is 64bit so GPU would not perform so well.


[01-Nov-18 09:51 AM] ATLAS#7218
@vveljk it might be sharing the bandwidth with the internet?


[01-Nov-18 09:52 AM] vveljk#9869
no...it is on local network

SHA384


[01-Nov-18 09:52 AM] ATLAS#7218
Sorry about the confusion.


[01-Nov-18 09:52 AM] Mike#2447
Arweave uses SHA384.


[01-Nov-18 09:53 AM] vveljk#9869
but it is sharing bandwith to the  switch which is 1Gbit network


[01-Nov-18 09:54 AM] ATLAS#7218
@vveljk I'm not familiar with iSCSI so it seems I can't help you

Maybe check your network usage stats


[01-Nov-18 09:56 AM] vveljk#9869
ok


[01-Nov-18 09:58 AM] vveljk#9869
network usage close to nothing

whats the question on Iscsi?


[01-Nov-18 09:59 AM] vveljk#9869
how much worse it is compared to having disk on SATA


[01-Nov-18 10:00 AM] beast#6522
depends on the underlying disk


[01-Nov-18 10:00 AM] beast#6522
if the underlying disk is a sata, then not bad


[01-Nov-18 10:00 AM] beast#6522
ssd


[01-Nov-18 10:00 AM] beast#6522
vs hd


[01-Nov-18 10:00 AM] vveljk#9869
There are 3 HDD 7200rpm SATA3


[01-Nov-18 10:00 AM] vveljk#9869
using RAID 5


[01-Nov-18 10:00 AM] vveljk#9869
QNAP NAS


[01-Nov-18 10:01 AM] vveljk#9869
write speed should be over 100MB/s


[01-Nov-18 10:01 AM] vveljk#9869
read speed even better


[01-Nov-18 10:02 AM] vveljk#9869
so there comes already a limit of 1Gbit network speed


[01-Nov-18 10:02 AM] vveljk#9869
but I don't know how much does this affect latency times or I/O speeed?


[01-Nov-18 10:02 AM] beast#6522
if you have your disks set to not sleep, its not bad, it really about your raid and number of disks more then isci, i have a ready nas with 8 4tb drives raid 6, and iscsi i am  getting most of my network band with, when hard wired,    850 mbps


[01-Nov-18 10:02 AM] beast#6522
on 1 gbs network


[01-Nov-18 10:03 AM] beast#6522
i use it for windows backups of my dev machines


[01-Nov-18 10:03 AM] vveljk#9869
the same case here  


[01-Nov-18 10:04 AM] vveljk#9869
so mostly they are doing nothing  


[01-Nov-18 10:04 AM] beast#6522
yep


[01-Nov-18 10:04 AM] beast#6522
i do have to wait for the spin up tho, i do it to get max life out of the drives


[01-Nov-18 10:04 AM] ATLAS#7218
@vveljk So your write speed is over 100MB/s over a shared switch of 1Gbit. Its possibly interrupting your internet while r/w.


[01-Nov-18 10:05 AM] vveljk#9869
hmmm  


[01-Nov-18 10:05 AM] vveljk#9869
How can I check that


[01-Nov-18 10:05 AM] vveljk#9869
maybe I could check if switch offers traffic monitor


[01-Nov-18 10:06 AM] ATLAS#7218
using `slurm` gives me 13GBs received per day.


[01-Nov-18 10:07 AM] ATLAS#7218
But its better to monitor your RX and TX speed over time and check if its consistent


[01-Nov-18 10:21 AM] Vilenarios#8742
@Mike idk how they mine so many consecutive blocks


[01-Nov-18 10:22 AM] Vilenarios#8742
only way is that they have very high hashrate and network.  solve a block, send it out to close peers, immediately start hashing on the next one before everyone else...


[01-Nov-18 10:22 AM] Vilenarios#8742
idk just my theory


[01-Nov-18 10:23 AM] Vilenarios#8742
They basically get a head start before us retail miners.  This is all downside of not have a pool model


[01-Nov-18 10:24 AM] Vilenarios#8742
BUT upside is when you get a block you get 7 ar  


[01-Nov-18 10:30 AM] patrick#8648
@arweave-sam  is there a way tro "purge" the extra blocks that i have (i've got about 100 more than the block height)


[01-Nov-18 10:33 AM] arweave-sam#9630
`ar_cleanup:all().` on the console after your node has joined the network should do it @patrick

[01-Nov-18 10:36 AM] arweave-sam#9630
> solve a block, send it out to close peers, immediately start hashing on the next one before everyone else...

I think that this is largely correct -- you get a natural advantage of a few seconds mining if you mine the previous block yourself (as everyone else has to check and adopt it first). The 'streakiness' should amortise out as the number of large miners in the network increases.


[01-Nov-18 10:37 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Regarding pool mechanics, I do not think that this would be healthy at this stage. It is up to the community to decide of course, but we won't be building support for it ourselves for a little while.


[01-Nov-18 10:37 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I kinda like not having a pool - its more on me to optimize my own stuff


[01-Nov-18 10:38 AM] Mike#2447
That's why I thought a speed bump would help smooth things out.  Like a 10 second pause after network confirmation, then everyone can "go!" at the same time.


[01-Nov-18 10:38 AM] S A L M O N#5069
What kind of Wallet can i use as mining adress?


[01-Nov-18 10:38 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@Mike The general problem with these kind of ideas is that they open doors for malicious actors


[01-Nov-18 10:38 AM] Mike#2447
I'll admit it's a selfish idea.  If I was a big miner, I would like to continue as things are  


[01-Nov-18 10:39 AM] Vilenarios#8742
but, big miners are spending more money in the end so


[01-Nov-18 10:39 AM] Vilenarios#8742
im just curious as to how much and on what gear


[01-Nov-18 10:39 AM] arweave-sam#9630
For example with the 10 second wait before mining the next block it creates a massive incentive for one of the big miners to find and remove the wait, giving them ~8% better mining yield


[01-Nov-18 10:40 AM] Mike#2447
You mean editing the code before running?


[01-Nov-18 10:40 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Indeed


[01-Nov-18 10:40 AM] Mike#2447
I see.


[01-Nov-18 10:41 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We cannot enforce that everyone runs the same software, the protocol itself has to enforce incentives to act in the right way


[01-Nov-18 10:42 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Sam, what happens if i just peer 2 servers with one another?


[01-Nov-18 10:42 AM] Vilenarios#8742
they just essentially create their own fork and mine every block?


[01-Nov-18 10:46 AM] arweave-sam#9630
If you limited the two peers to _only_ talk to each other, then they would mine their own fork, yes


[01-Nov-18 10:46 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Ah


[01-Nov-18 10:46 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You mean literally without any interaction with the outside world at all? (Like getting the first block, etc)


[01-Nov-18 10:47 AM] arweave-sam#9630
To make that work you would need to either start a new blockweave on one of the nodes, or have one of them 'join' the network by using a hash list found on disk


[01-Nov-18 10:49 AM] ! [[$0m€B0dy#0101
How many ar by block?


[01-Nov-18 10:54 AM] ATLAS#7218
~7


[01-Nov-18 10:57 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Thanks Sam!  Makes sense there are actions that have to happen to create a new blockweave.


[01-Nov-18 10:58 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep


[01-Nov-18 10:58 AM] arweave-sam#9630
If you are interested, you are looking for the `init` command line option  


[01-Nov-18 11:00 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Ah if i only had all day to tinker with it


[01-Nov-18 11:48 AM] patrick#8648
@arweave-sam  the key used by arweave is RS384?


[01-Nov-18 12:00 PM] patrick#8648
(signing method)


[01-Nov-18 12:00 PM] patrick#8648
all good. RSA-PSS is the answer


[01-Nov-18 12:19 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep, RSA-4k with PSS


[01-Nov-18 01:37 PM] rehash#3438
@arweave-sam I calculate the rewards for the remaining months of the  first year and 911400 AR will be rewarded to miners, what will happen with the rest to 5,5 mil ?


[01-Nov-18 01:38 PM] rehash#3438
600 bpd  * 7 months * 31 days * 7 ar = 911400


[01-Nov-18 01:58 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Hey @rehash -- no, after the 1.6 update has been adopted the rewards that would have been distributed over the soft on-boarding period (but were not) will be distributed over the rest of Y1.


[01-Nov-18 01:58 PM] arweave-sam#9630
So there will be a significant bump there


[01-Nov-18 01:59 PM] arweave-sam#9630
The amount released per block also changes per block, so it wouldn't be 7 AR for the rest of the year anyway  


[01-Nov-18 02:17 PM] ATLAS#7218
ETA of 1.6 is end of Q1. So there will be too much of an increase right?


[01-Nov-18 02:17 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We actually think it will be around block height 95000


[01-Nov-18 02:17 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We are way ahead of schedule with it  


[01-Nov-18 02:18 PM] Mike#2447
I'm writing that down!


[01-Nov-18 02:18 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Haha, we shall see


[01-Nov-18 02:18 PM] arweave-sam#9630
But it is looking good so far  


[01-Nov-18 02:22 PM] ATLAS#7218
216000 blocks for the first year. 5.5m - (95000-65000) blocks * 7 = 5.2m
5.2m / (216000 - 95000) = approx 43 AR/block.


[01-Nov-18 02:23 PM] ATLAS#7218
Dont you think its too big jump?


[01-Nov-18 02:23 PM] ATLAS#7218
 


[01-Nov-18 02:27 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We are keeping the actual emission rate directly in-line with the numbers that we agreed with the community in the year before launch. We think that providing a strong incentive for miners during Y1 will help with bringing people into the community :).


[01-Nov-18 02:28 PM] rehash#3438
why 7 - 43 and not 20-30


[01-Nov-18 02:28 PM] ATLAS#7218
Or just avg it now hahah


[01-Nov-18 02:29 PM] rehash#3438
when it will be 43 probably big players will get in and we won't get anything


[01-Nov-18 02:30 PM] ATLAS#7218
If we get 20 per block. uzi is gonna be rich af lol


[01-Nov-18 02:30 PM] Mike#2447
 


[01-Nov-18 02:31 PM] ATLAS#7218
What was the initial supply?


[01-Nov-18 02:31 PM] rehash#3438
is uzi no 1 miner?


[01-Nov-18 02:31 PM] ATLAS#7218
Not sure. But he gets a lot.


[01-Nov-18 02:31 PM] ATLAS#7218
Definitely top 3


[01-Nov-18 02:32 PM] ATLAS#7218
If reward is high now, I think miners will increase a lot


[01-Nov-18 02:42 PM] ATLAS#7218
I guess sam wants the PUMP


[01-Nov-18 02:43 PM] ATLAS#7218
7-42. Miners will throw out their gpus.


[01-Nov-18 02:44 PM] ATLAS#7218
cpu mining back in the game.


[01-Nov-18 03:00 PM] Vilenarios#8742
If reward is too high AR price will go down.


[01-Nov-18 03:00 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Not to speculate, but rules of supply and demand are important for us miners.


[01-Nov-18 03:02 PM] Vilenarios#8742
It should balance itself out though.


[01-Nov-18 03:05 PM] patrick#8648
how is a wallet address generated from the public key?


[01-Nov-18 03:06 PM] Goldfinger#4647
Before price goes down AR must be listed on an exchange 


[01-Nov-18 04:54 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I wonder if I can get around my single public IP woes with a VPN service... may sow network down too much


[01-Nov-18 05:21 PM] Mike#2447
I was also looking at this.  There seems to be a number of providers.  Another option would be to get a cheap VPS with static IP and configure your own VPN.  I just haven't had time to dig into this yet.


[01-Nov-18 05:41 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Mike we gonna figure this one out man  


[01-Nov-18 05:58 PM] ATLAS#7218
@Vilenarios so you suggest people to sell before that reward increase?


[01-Nov-18 05:58 PM] ATLAS#7218
I guess it will be a dump on exchange listing then


[01-Nov-18 05:59 PM] ATLAS#7218
   


[01-Nov-18 05:59 PM] Vilenarios#8742
In respect for the team I’m not gonna speculate or talk about price here, even though it definitely relates to how much effort the mining community puts in.


[01-Nov-18 06:00 PM] ATLAS#7218
42AR/block = 30.24$/block at ico price


[01-Nov-18 07:56 PM] patrick#8648
Answered my own qurestion -- an address is derived by using the "n" in the arweave wallet. First  (raw!!!) base64url decode the string, take its SHA256, and then (raw again!) base64url encode the resulting hash


[01-Nov-18 07:56 PM] patrick#8648
phew that took a while


[01-Nov-18 07:56 PM] patrick#8648
definitely need better docs, going through the erlang codebase won't be good for ppl


[01-Nov-18 08:01 PM] Vilenarios#8742
yeah... the team needs some bounties posted or hire some interns or something to write this stuff


[01-Nov-18 08:02 PM] patrick#8648
definitely.


[01-Nov-18 08:34 PM] Vilenarios#8742
damn, beam.smp was just using 26gb of RAM....


[01-Nov-18 09:13 PM] dggr3#5853
hello, i'm reading the mining guide, and have a basic question: is there a wallet application for Arweave that can be installed on a mac, or a windows machine?


[01-Nov-18 09:24 PM] dggr3#5853
never mind, figured it out, Chrome addon


[02-Nov-18 12:35 AM] WILL#5685
uzi3T79yVBeff3FwMHGNlp35pNta609xFZ6VdPCE564     great!  great!


[02-Nov-18 12:44 AM] patrick#8648
why are blocks so insanely huge? This one is 5.3 MB with no transactions inside!  `3obrAN4pwwkO9HSGCjW3AOav3cjUIwcP3Ewo_ev7W9GLJeeW69qVeAvdelOVlA7c`


[02-Nov-18 12:51 AM] codybartfast#9308
In earlier versions all blocks were big, as they contained all wallet information.   This was fixed a while back and blocks shrunk to KB not MB.  So I'd guess there's still an old version serving blocks out there.  I think it will eventually get shrunk locally.   My block directory is getting smaller as old blocks get shrunk.


[02-Nov-18 12:52 AM] patrick#8648
mmmm interesting


[02-Nov-18 12:52 AM] patrick#8648
so PICWFRFhyqGgUlwYNyXNkK2EPZluBL8v-F8kfzXC8VA mined it


[02-Nov-18 12:52 AM] patrick#8648
i wonder what version he/she is running


[02-Nov-18 12:53 AM] codybartfast#9308
I should say I'm only guessing here, but it might not be the miner.  If I get a block from an intermediate mine then I guess that might still have the larger blocks.


[02-Nov-18 02:33 AM] vveljk#9869
I noticed today that I got accepted block on network but didn't get any reward


[02-Nov-18 02:33 AM] vveljk#9869
what is the reason for that?

Also noticed that 3 times during night I got only to stage 2/3


[02-Nov-18 02:36 AM] vveljk#9869
is there some delay with this rewards?


[02-Nov-18 05:30 AM] Vilenarios#8742
What you are seeing is expected behavior.


[02-Nov-18 05:31 AM] Vilenarios#8742
If you mine the block you aren’t guaranteed that block until the network accepts it. You could send your block out but someone else could have mined it a little sooner than you, or had a faster network and transmitted it out faster.


[02-Nov-18 05:32 AM] Vilenarios#8742
If you see a lot of stage 1s and no stage 2s then your CPU isn’t fast enough.


[02-Nov-18 05:32 AM] Vilenarios#8742
If you see a lot of stage 2s and no stage 3s then your network may not be fast enough.


[02-Nov-18 05:32 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Stage 3 is where you get the reward @vveljk


[02-Nov-18 06:25 AM] yemboy#6783
@Vilenarios we need like a 4.0 - 4.5gHz processor and 1gpbs network speed minimum.


[02-Nov-18 06:39 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Haha yeah so it seems.


[02-Nov-18 06:39 AM] Vilenarios#8742
And all blocks downloaded.


[02-Nov-18 07:22 AM] Marcin#0065
If you havent all blocks, ur machine seems to be more busy with downloading block too. Should be easiert for people, if they have all blocks up to date, so the network aint busy with doanloading any more


[02-Nov-18 07:51 AM] vveljk#9869
how to choose to have all blocks downloaded?


[02-Nov-18 07:56 AM] Mike#2447
There is no "choice" per se.  You just have to wait.  It's possible to rewrite the code to make it download more blocks, but then you risk being negatively marked by the wildfire protocol.


[02-Nov-18 08:06 AM] ATLAS#7218
@vveljk your block is most probably accepted but viewblock is just not showing it properly


[02-Nov-18 08:06 AM] ATLAS#7218
My rewards decreased 4 fold today

I had another wallet balance regression, so negative progress!


[02-Nov-18 08:50 AM] ATLAS#7218
which node you using? better just use your own. VB is awful


[02-Nov-18 08:51 AM] Mike#2447
I'm using VB.  I guess I suffer for the convenience LOL.

idk whose node that is tho


[02-Nov-18 08:53 AM] ATLAS#7218
or i heard that new arweave extension can choose the node

Nope, we aren't mining.


[02-Nov-18 09:21 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Which address did you think it was @ATLAS?


[02-Nov-18 09:57 AM] ATLAS#7218
aE....


[02-Nov-18 09:58 AM] ATLAS#7218
It was the reward address of your aws server


[02-Nov-18 10:53 AM] ATLAS#7218
Holy fuk. It seems my hdd is rekt already


[02-Nov-18 10:53 AM] Vilenarios#8742
What happened?


[02-Nov-18 10:54 AM] ATLAS#7218
Just did a restart to see the conditions becsuse my reward decreased a lot. It was noisier than usual so I suspected my hdd and tried to copy file from it. Max speed 100KB


[02-Nov-18 10:55 AM] Mike#2447
 


[02-Nov-18 10:56 AM] ATLAS#7218
At least it was enough to get my json lol


[02-Nov-18 10:57 AM] Mike#2447
I was just telling Kevin in the support channel to make sure he has a copy of his json in a safe location.  Real world example here!


[02-Nov-18 10:58 AM] ATLAS#7218
Probably the arm got some friction or smth. But 100KB is too much of a decrease lol. Trying to do some disk checkup.


[02-Nov-18 10:59 AM] ATLAS#7218
At least I have all my blocks backed up


[02-Nov-18 04:44 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Anyone figure out how to start up WSL and start arweave-server upon bootup?


[02-Nov-18 04:47 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Gonna try just a good ol powershell script on windows scheduled task, and call bash...


[02-Nov-18 04:48 PM] kevint#5113
It would be cool to have an auto restart script if it's interrupted as well


[02-Nov-18 04:48 PM] Vilenarios#8742
oh believe me - monitoring is also on the agenda


[02-Nov-18 04:48 PM] Vilenarios#8742
monitor/restart


[02-Nov-18 04:49 PM] kevint#5113
lol, mine just died right now


[02-Nov-18 04:49 PM] Vilenarios#8742
probably do like a curl on your host, and a curl on your peer and if your block height is too far off, then do a restart, or if your block height hasnt increased, or crashed or things along those lines


[02-Nov-18 04:50 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Its really different than any other miner, because we are basically mining, being a database and webserver. so lots of crap could go wrong in theory


[02-Nov-18 04:51 PM] kevint#5113
That is definitely not my forte


[02-Nov-18 05:06 PM] Massimiliano#2834
Hi what are the system requirements to mine on a Windows laptop?


[02-Nov-18 06:11 PM] Vilenarios#8742
To make it worthwhile you really need a dual core, multi-threaded CPU, with at least 8GB RAM


[02-Nov-18 06:11 PM] Vilenarios#8742
1 CPU core would be useless, and 4GB of ram is pretty limiting...


[02-Nov-18 06:12 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Then you need to install windows subsystem for linux and Ubuntu 18.0.4

It seems sam didn't know their aws was mining  


[02-Nov-18 09:53 PM] ATLAS#7218
@Vilenarios I actually made various shits on python including that


[02-Nov-18 09:55 PM] ATLAS#7218
Used python because of ast.literal_eval(). All the responses are dictionary or lists in literal evaluation so was easier to handle


[02-Nov-18 11:52 PM] ATLAS#7218
Hmm all the checkups give 100% healthy. What could be the problem?


[02-Nov-18 11:53 PM] ATLAS#7218
SMART detects bad arm right?


[03-Nov-18 01:07 AM] lstr#7037
Hello , how do I start mining?


[03-Nov-18 06:54 AM] ATLAS#7218
@lstr email team@arweave.org to get mining instructions


[03-Nov-18 12:55 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Is anyone here getting consistently good node state latency under 50k?


[03-Nov-18 12:56 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Seems like mine is getting worse... idk if ISP is throttling me or something.


[03-Nov-18 03:52 PM] Marcin#0065
When mininfg, i have 50-200k. In idle (no recall block) i have around 10k


[03-Nov-18 03:53 PM] Marcin#0065
I get with a normal personal computer machine few blocks a day


[03-Nov-18 06:21 PM] Mike#2447
WARNING: No foreign blocks received from network. Please check your internet connection.


[03-Nov-18 06:22 PM] Mike#2447
I'm getting this all the time now on all my miners.  Anyone else?


[03-Nov-18 06:22 PM] Mike#2447
When I say all the time, I mean once or twice per day LOL.


[03-Nov-18 11:49 PM] WILL#5685
Why does the upvest wallet not show the VR coins I dug?


[03-Nov-18 11:56 PM] lstr#7037
老哥，你用啥配置挖到


[04-Nov-18 03:08 AM] Vilenarios#8742
@Mike yeah I get that a few times a day now. Even on my main miner.


[04-Nov-18 05:46 AM] Dentechr#5213
Vilenarios i got anywere from 30k to 100k latency. But that is only when i use 50% or less cpu cores for hashing


[04-Nov-18 08:30 AM] vveljk#9869
@Vilenarios I am always below 40k Latency, but never below 10k  


[04-Nov-18 08:30 AM] vveljk#9869
But I have problems with snycing blocks


[04-Nov-18 08:30 AM] vveljk#9869
this goes really slow and during this sync I don't get any blocks to mine


[04-Nov-18 08:31 AM] vveljk#9869
All my computer is doing is syncing and sharing this blocks with others


[04-Nov-18 08:31 AM] vveljk#9869
I also noticed that after some time I always get connection to only 30 peers, but at the start I always get like 80 peers


[04-Nov-18 08:32 AM] vveljk#9869
Why does this number always drop to 30 peers and why do I not get blocks to mine during blocks sync


[04-Nov-18 08:32 AM] vveljk#9869
at the moment I am at "blocks":11539 and there are already 75k blocks


[04-Nov-18 08:33 AM] vveljk#9869
if I need to wait to sync the network than I will never get to mine  


[04-Nov-18 08:33 AM] vveljk#9869
how can I speed that up?


[04-Nov-18 10:22 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Unfortunately, I dont think there is a way to speed it up.


[04-Nov-18 10:23 AM] Vilenarios#8742
What I did was set up a few miners and had them get to like 10k blocks each, then i combined all of the blocks/txs/wallet_lists


[04-Nov-18 11:22 AM] vveljk#9869
OK


[04-Nov-18 11:22 AM] vveljk#9869
good idea


[04-Nov-18 11:23 AM] vveljk#9869
so I just copy them to each other?


[04-Nov-18 11:24 AM] Vilenarios#8742
yes, make sure to stop the miners first before you copy over the blocks/txs/wallet_lists


[04-Nov-18 11:24 AM] Vilenarios#8742
also i copy the files themselves, NOT the whole folder


[04-Nov-18 11:24 AM] Vilenarios#8742
and you can skip over the duplicates instead of overwriting, so you only copy over the unique blocks


[04-Nov-18 11:24 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I think copying folders can lead to incorrect permissions


[04-Nov-18 12:27 PM] Marcin#0065
Lol i won a battle against uzi once xD
He had the block first in vb, but after few minutes he didnt and i got the block ;) 
David vs Goliath xD


[04-Nov-18 12:46 PM] vveljk#9869
@Vilenarios tnx...I will do it tomorrow  


[04-Nov-18 12:50 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Hahaha. I wonder what those miners are running and what max_miner setting they use


[04-Nov-18 01:00 PM] Marcin#0065
Propably some clusters


[04-Nov-18 01:01 PM] tiamat#9131
some kind of burst maybe? uzi has 7 blocks in a row, then nothing for 20-30


[04-Nov-18 01:01 PM] Marcin#0065
I had on university one guy who used the big university server cluster for DNA computing for Ether-mining xD
He got kicked out soon, but got pretty nice amount of ether back then. He is laughing at the university today lols


[04-Nov-18 08:49 PM] WILL#5685
Who can give me the IP address of  peer?


[05-Nov-18 01:39 AM] vveljk#9869
Good morning everyone  


[05-Nov-18 01:39 AM] vveljk#9869
Simple questions for IT guru  


[05-Nov-18 01:40 AM] vveljk#9869
If I have two arweave miners in house how can I make forward port 1984 to both  


[05-Nov-18 01:41 AM] vveljk#9869
How can I solve that issue?


[05-Nov-18 01:41 AM] vveljk#9869
Do I need in both cases public port 1984?


[05-Nov-18 01:41 AM] vveljk#9869
or can one be on 1984 and the other on 1985?


[05-Nov-18 01:41 AM] vveljk#9869
and on local side I use for both 1984


[05-Nov-18 04:03 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Right now, you can’t.


[05-Nov-18 04:04 AM] Vilenarios#8742
You can’t port forward the same port multiple times on a single IP


[05-Nov-18 04:04 AM] Vilenarios#8742
If your router had load balancing capabilities, then you could do that aka send requests to both your web servers.


[05-Nov-18 04:07 AM] Vilenarios#8742
For your second miner the best way at the moment is to use your normal peer list and add the polling flag to your startup command.


[05-Nov-18 04:08 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Polling seems to lead to delays in block downloading and is harder to get a block sent out across the network. But I’m interested to hear how it works for you @vveljk


[05-Nov-18 05:47 AM] Vilenarios#8742
What does "peering" actually do?  Is it just for the initial 100 block sync or are the peers the first nodes that receive the blocks you mine or have other unique properties compared to other nodes you connect with?


[05-Nov-18 08:15 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@WILL Here are three of our nodes you can use. Keep in mind that you are trusting the nodes by starting from them, so only use ours if you trust us.

54.93.54.173:1984
35.178.129.36:1984
52.33.231.154:1984


[05-Nov-18 08:16 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@Vilenarios -- indeed, this is only the peer that you trust to download the block hash list from.


[05-Nov-18 08:17 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The block hash list tells you the 'state of the network'. With it, you can verify all of the data contained within the weave (all of the other data is cryptographically related).


[05-Nov-18 08:18 AM] arweave-sam#9630
After you download the first 100 blocks, the trusted peers are the same as the untrusted ones  


[05-Nov-18 08:27 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Thank you Sam. 🙏🏻 How is node state latency calculated?


[05-Nov-18 08:30 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We send a message from the HTTP worker process (that you spawn on the node when you send a message) through the processes that perform book keeping in your node, then back to the HTTP process, then report the time that that takes


[05-Nov-18 08:31 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Wow so it’s all internally calculated and has nothing to do with the actual network?


[05-Nov-18 08:32 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yes, that is the internal book keeping process latency


[05-Nov-18 08:33 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We put it in the stats mostly for our internal use when monitoring the network -- we didn't expect people to pay so much attention to it, although it does act as a pretty good 'node health indicator'.


[05-Nov-18 08:35 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Well as I understand it, the higher latency means longer it takes to receive updates and requests on the network.


[05-Nov-18 08:35 AM] Vilenarios#8742
But it shouldn’t affect distribution of a new block right?


[05-Nov-18 08:36 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Because that is a distribution as opposed to http request. And the miner shouldn’t be running during block distribution right?


[05-Nov-18 08:38 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Mining and block distribution are concurrent processes, so they will both happen at (or around) the same time


[05-Nov-18 08:38 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Meaning the the performance of one (or the book keeping around it) will affect the performance of the other


[05-Nov-18 08:38 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Got it


[05-Nov-18 08:40 AM] Vilenarios#8742
This whole time I’m like thinking my ISP is throttling my network but node state latency has nothing to do with actual bandwidth!


[05-Nov-18 08:41 AM] arweave-sam#9630
D:


[05-Nov-18 08:41 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Sorry about that


[05-Nov-18 08:41 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We can expose some more useful performance stats


[05-Nov-18 08:41 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Perhaps on their own endpoint


[05-Nov-18 08:42 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Could be useful to help fine tune things.


[05-Nov-18 08:42 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep


[05-Nov-18 08:42 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The `GET /metrics` endpoint gives you a huge amount of data


[05-Nov-18 08:43 AM] arweave-sam#9630
But you need Grafana in order to properly be able to process it


[05-Nov-18 08:43 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Wtf is Grafana lol


[05-Nov-18 08:44 AM] arweave-sam#9630
It is a kind of graphing tool


[05-Nov-18 08:45 AM] arweave-sam#9630
It takes lots of data inputs and allows you to turn them into nice dashboards  


[05-Nov-18 08:59 AM] kevint#5113
Has anyone created an auto restart script of some kind they would be willing to share? I can't seen to stay connected to my network, not sure if it's the computer or the router, but I get many of these each day -  "WARNING: No foreign blocks received from network. Please check your internet connection."


[05-Nov-18 09:00 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hey @kevint are you able to access `http://[your external IP]/info`?


[05-Nov-18 09:01 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Normally this message is an indicator that other nodes in the network are having trouble sending messages to you


[05-Nov-18 09:26 AM] Vilenarios#8742
/metrics is blowing my mind. So much data. So many questions!


[05-Nov-18 09:27 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Haha, yeah


[05-Nov-18 09:27 AM] arweave-sam#9630
It gets pretty deep


[05-Nov-18 09:28 AM] rehash#3438
/metrics is concerning, so much information about the node, definitely not safe to be public


[05-Nov-18 09:28 AM] rehash#3438
how can I disable it on my node?


[05-Nov-18 09:31 AM] arweave-sam#9630
What information are you particularly concerned about?


[05-Nov-18 09:33 AM] rehash#3438
memory, file descriptors, processes, looks like a serious security hole


[05-Nov-18 09:35 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We will make it optional in the next release (remove it with `disable metrics`), but the number of processes running inside the Erlang VM (which you are only using to run Arweave) is not sensitive information


[05-Nov-18 09:37 AM] rehash#3438
what if someone starts a DDOS and has all the tools to check how successfully it goes, plus some memory overflows attacks, hell knows what


[05-Nov-18 09:39 AM] arweave-sam#9630
They could also see how it is going by looking at response time from nodes, or the node_state_latency, or an number of other indicators.


[05-Nov-18 09:41 AM] Vilenarios#8742
@kevint I’m desperate for scripting abilities but using Windows Subsystem for Linux is challenging.


[05-Nov-18 09:42 AM] Vilenarios#8742
My normal scripting ways don’t work. May have to do all scripting within WSL itself as opposed to power shell/command prompt.


[05-Nov-18 09:47 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I cant even kill the beam process via powershell


[05-Nov-18 01:49 PM] kevint#5113
@Vilenarios  I have a regular linux install on a laptop that has the same issue, even when I'm hardwired to the router. Not sure where the problem is.


[05-Nov-18 01:50 PM] Vilenarios#8742
a chron job to kill the beam process, then run your arweave-miner every 4 hours or something


[05-Nov-18 01:50 PM] Vilenarios#8742
ideally it would check your own block height against a trusted peer, and restart if your own block height doesnt change


[05-Nov-18 07:34 PM] Vilenarios#8742
@arweave-sam any reason why i see my default gateway in my list of peers? aka {192,168,1,1,1984},

@Vilenarios Where can I find all the options of arweave-server ?


[06-Nov-18 06:36 AM] vveljk#9869
Or better how do you set a flag for pooling?


[06-Nov-18 07:21 AM] arweave-sam#9630
If you just run `./arweave-server` the options are listed


[06-Nov-18 07:21 AM] vveljk#9869
@arweave-sam tnx


[06-Nov-18 07:21 AM] vveljk#9869
I will check it


[06-Nov-18 07:22 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@Vilenarios Not sure -- that seems odd. Could plausibly be a peer that you received from another peer. Some networks use *.0 for the gateway, so *.1 could be the first allocated DHCP address.


[06-Nov-18 11:49 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I think i figured it out - if i check my /info page on my nodes, from another internally networked computer (without arweave) the request comes in as my default gateway


[06-Nov-18 11:49 AM] Vilenarios#8742
but then it adds the default gateway as a peer


[06-Nov-18 11:50 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Does requesting a nodes /info page (or any other page) automatically add you as a peer to that node?


[06-Nov-18 02:50 PM] Mike#2447
I don't fully understand the "No foreign blocks received from network." warning.  It prints exactly once every hour, but in the meantime I'm still downloading old blocks all day.  It just doesn't download newly created blocks.  And this is a relatively new development.  Miners that didn't used to have this error now report it daily, starting maybe a week or two ago.


[06-Nov-18 02:51 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Happens to me too Mike -  not sure how to fix.  sometimes it resolves itself, other times it doesnt.  Not sure what causes it either, i just turned on HTTP logging, and noticed my miner is down now... so hopefully tonight i can anlyze log files and see whats up


[06-Nov-18 04:35 PM] ATLAS#7218
@Mike @Vilenarios I think it gives that warning when your block height doesn't increase for 90 minutes.


[06-Nov-18 04:57 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Thanks Baz. I’m pretty sure my internet is uninterrupted as is my rig. Maybe this is a problem with WSL alone.

@Mike @Vilenarios -- You see that warning not when you cannot talk to the network at all, but when the network appears to have stopped sending messages to you.


[07-Nov-18 03:53 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Which versions are you running, and are you running it in polling mode?


[07-Nov-18 04:16 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I was getting the message on both polling and non-polling nodes.


[07-Nov-18 04:17 AM] Vilenarios#8742
More so in polling mode though.


[07-Nov-18 04:36 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Interesting -- residential or commercial connection?


[07-Nov-18 05:11 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Residential. Maybe there is a blip but no extended outage beyond a minute.


[07-Nov-18 05:11 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I haven’t seen the issue since testing the develop branch.

I see


[07-Nov-18 06:20 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I will have to check the commit log, but I think we improved the emitting of that error slightly since the last RC


[07-Nov-18 06:43 AM] Mike#2447
Conversely, I feel like I didn't start seeing the error until I tried out the develop branch.


[07-Nov-18 07:02 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Will keep monitoring and report back.


[07-Nov-18 07:52 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Well that was fast - i saw the issue again, but the miner seemed to recover very quickly, and there was no block lag


[07-Nov-18 07:54 AM] Mike#2447
What did you change?


[07-Nov-18 07:55 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Nothing at all.  Since i switched to the develop branch, my web requests have been super responsive and my miner was actually running and at current block height for the past 12 hours


[07-Nov-18 07:56 AM] Vilenarios#8742
even my polling ones


[07-Nov-18 07:56 AM] Vilenarios#8742

does it matter which directory i run all that install scripts?


[07-Nov-18 09:58 AM] Mike#2447
I don't think so, as long as you have full permissions.


[07-Nov-18 09:58 AM] Mike#2447
I'd just stick to your home directory.

Hi all,

`N.1.5.0.0-RC-6` is now out! You can check it out by running `git fetch --all ; git checkout N.1.5.0.0-RC-6`.

Highlights from this release:
- Improved block read from disk speed, resulting in substantially faster (~60-70%) block adoption and fork recovery processes.
- Optimised memory usage mechanics, resulting in ~80% memory usage reduction on some nodes.
- The `GET /metrics` endpoint is now optional. Add `disable metrics` to your command line options to prohibit it.

Thanks as always to our community testers!

@Vilenarios normally that means that Erlang is not installed properly. What happens if you try to run `erl` on the command line?


[07-Nov-18 10:10 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Yup that was exactly it - erlang was not installed right


[07-Nov-18 10:10 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Lesson learned

Have you tried different peers mike?


[07-Nov-18 10:21 AM] Mike#2447
Yes.  I've had this issue before, where it won't join for a long time, but slowly improves.  About 10 minutes ago it would download 82 blocks and then stop.  Just now it gets up to 84 and then stops.  Eventually it will make it to 100, but I don't know the cause.  This is the error when it stops downloading:

[07-Nov-18 10:22 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@Vilenarios I would advise that you copy txs, wallet_lists and blocks directories only, rather than the whole arweave install.


[07-Nov-18 10:24 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@Mike Please can you try another peer?


[07-Nov-18 10:24 AM] Mike#2447
Up to 86 now LOL.


[07-Nov-18 10:24 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Ex 206.189.5.91


[07-Nov-18 10:25 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Also, please can you DM me thee peer that you are currently trying?


[07-Nov-18 10:31 AM] Mike#2447
I individually ran through every peer you had previously recommended and just tried again with 206.189.5.91 and got the same error.  I'm up to 94 blocks before the error hits though, so based on past experience, it will soon make it to 100.


[07-Nov-18 10:33 AM] Mike#2447
The error appears whether polling or not.  Up to 98 now.  So close!


[07-Nov-18 10:43 AM] Mike#2447
I've made it past the error, whatever it was.

Network join time is now 10 seconds!  It used to be minimum 1 minute for me and sometimes several minutes.  Nice job  


[07-Nov-18 10:43 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Give me multi port and then i can finally start spending money on more miners  


[07-Nov-18 10:44 AM] Vilenarios#8742
although it seems polling may not have any negative consequences now


[07-Nov-18 10:44 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Have you verified that multiport does not work for you already, @Vilenarios ?


[07-Nov-18 10:44 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Nope, i havent - i didnt even know it was available already


[07-Nov-18 10:44 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Ah


[07-Nov-18 10:44 AM] arweave-sam#9630
`port XXXX` on the command line  


[07-Nov-18 10:44 AM] Vilenarios#8742
easy enough


[07-Nov-18 10:45 AM] Mike#2447
I will also have to try this out.

[07-Nov-18 10:56 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@Mike -- just looking into the JSON error you reported earlier. What platform are you using., please?


[07-Nov-18 10:58 AM] Mike#2447
LinuxMint 19 XFCE, which is based on Ubuntu 18.04.


[07-Nov-18 10:58 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Thanks


[07-Nov-18 10:59 AM] arweave-sam#9630
And you tried different peers, all got stuck at around the same place?


[07-Nov-18 10:59 AM] Mike#2447
Correct.  I think I tried 6 different peers, all individually.


[07-Nov-18 11:00 AM] Mike#2447
It's like there was a bad block that I had to get past or something.


[07-Nov-18 11:00 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Interesting, we are having trouble replicating it


[07-Nov-18 11:11 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Ah


[07-Nov-18 11:11 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Ok


[07-Nov-18 11:12 AM] arweave-sam#9630
It looks like the block in question was being read from your disk (not the remote trusted peers) and was corrupted during writing. Did you interrupt the startup process the first time you tried to make the node join today? @Mike


[07-Nov-18 11:14 AM] Mike#2447
I can't say for sure, but it's definitely possible.


[07-Nov-18 11:17 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I see.

Would you mind zipping the 100 blocks around number 77777 from your local `blocks` directory and sending it over to me please?


[07-Nov-18 12:03 PM] patrick#8648

woah what was the main change herE?


[07-Nov-18 02:34 PM] arweave-sam#9630
A few different things in conjunction


[07-Nov-18 02:35 PM] arweave-sam#9630
The thing I am most interested in for this release is the effect it will have for people mining on slower connections


[07-Nov-18 02:36 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Your wildfire score will still be lower, but because you can adopt blocks and fork recover faster now mining should (in theory) be more efficient


[07-Nov-18 02:36 PM] Vilenarios#8742
seems more efficient already


[07-Nov-18 02:36 PM] Vilenarios#8742
why would wildfire score be lower?


[07-Nov-18 02:37 PM] Marcin#0065
How does the wildfire score sums up?


[07-Nov-18 02:37 PM] arweave-sam#9630
WF always prefers faster connections @Vilenarios , so the higher latency/lower bandwidth routes are deprioritised


[07-Nov-18 02:38 PM] Vilenarios#8742
And it determines a fast connection by a block get?


[07-Nov-18 02:38 PM] Vilenarios#8742
or a ping or something?


[07-Nov-18 02:38 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@Marcin The scores don't sum across the network per se, each node keeps its own rankings of all the other nodes it has interacted with


[07-Nov-18 02:38 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@Vilenarios Not just block GETs, all requests


[07-Nov-18 02:39 PM] arweave-sam#9630
> seems more efficient already

@Vilenarios Interesting -- what makes you think that?


[07-Nov-18 02:39 PM] Marcin#0065
Where its kept?


[07-Nov-18 02:39 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Internally in the node @Marcin


[07-Nov-18 02:40 PM] Marcin#0065
Any insight to see "the best" nodes?


[07-Nov-18 02:40 PM] Marcin#0065
To connect to?


[07-Nov-18 02:41 PM] arweave-sam#9630
The 'best' node will be determined locally


[07-Nov-18 02:41 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Which is why the WF rankings are off-chain/non-global


[07-Nov-18 02:43 PM] arweave-sam#9630
The best nodes for us in German will be terrible nodes for those in Australia, etc


[07-Nov-18 03:00 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Sam, reason why i said more efficient is based on the fact that all 4 my miners are consistently at block height, ram usage reduced, i was able to bump max_miners since the network lag vastly reduced


[07-Nov-18 03:01 PM] Vilenarios#8742
ultimately, it seems like ive successfully mined more blocks in the past 24 hours than previous periods


[07-Nov-18 03:03 PM] Vilenarios#8742
will be setting my 2 internal miners to different ports tonight, so i can see if that improves anything


[07-Nov-18 03:31 PM] Mike#2447
In RC-7 I'd like  to see the mining info print in the local time.  Currently I have to do math to make sure it's correct.


[07-Nov-18 03:38 PM] Mike#2447
I changed the number of max_miners on a node to see if it's improved and rejoined the network in 8 seconds!  Woo!


[07-Nov-18 05:54 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Does stopping/restarting node reset or negatively affect wildfire score?


[07-Nov-18 05:56 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Will miners on different ports behind same public IP have the same wildfire score or different?


[07-Nov-18 07:25 PM] Vilenarios#8742
@arweave-sam tried multi-port.  Used a different port, setup forwarding/firewall.  Joined arweave network just fine - can reach the node via external ip.  However, when i check the peers it ONLY lists itself and its trusted peers.  If i check those trusted peers peers list, i do not see my node with custom port.  I will let it mine for a bit and see what happens...


[07-Nov-18 07:27 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Looks like it stopped downloading blocks... gonna set it back to polling for now

[08-Nov-18 03:42 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hey @Vilenarios , very good to hear re: performance! This is what we had anticipated, but it is very good to hear that it is working that way in practice.

@Mike Yep, we are aware of this. It likely won't go into an RC-7 though, but 1.5.1. If we don't encounter any issues with RC-6 we will re-tag as 1.5.0-FINAL in a few days, then put any minor revisions in sub-point releases. The first test versions of 1.6 are on the horizon now, too :).

@tiamat Indeed. How much RAM are you using now?


[08-Nov-18 03:44 AM] tiamat#9131
taking only 7% on 16 GB


[08-Nov-18 03:45 AM] tiamat#9131
in earlier releases it was in the +40% area

More and more miner are coming in, which is nice. But im concerned about the whole idea of decentralizastion, since its very few mining adresses gathering most of the tokens. And since with WF and storage of blocks, it seems to me, that the big palyer will just become bigger. I havent encountered any ico with such few main miners in the alst years, which is why im concerned


[08-Nov-18 05:41 AM] Marcin#0065
Regarding the token amounts, we got also a minority of adresses keeping the majority of tokens already.

[08-Nov-18 08:06 AM] Vilenarios#8742
maybe the big miners are running 50 super high powered machines and paying tens of thousands of dollars

[08-Nov-18 08:06 AM] Vilenarios#8742
it will balance itself out


[08-Nov-18 08:06 AM] Marcin#0065
Baz. A time trigger between each mined block would help a lot in that case to make it more fair i think. But its probably one of many solution to avoid centralized mining


[08-Nov-18 08:07 AM] Vilenarios#8742
how does bitcoin avoid that issue?


[08-Nov-18 08:07 AM] ATLAS#7218

Bitcoin mining is not for the people any more, it has been the first year maybe. Today bitcoin mining is a pure business model


[08-Nov-18 08:08 AM] Vilenarios#8742
So then why shouldnt arweave  


[08-Nov-18 08:08 AM] ATLAS#7218
First year it was centralized like Arweave


[08-Nov-18 08:08 AM] ATLAS#7218
For example. there was only 2 miner at the beginning

If you look at VB, the list of finders is MUCH improved.  No more 10 blocks in a row for one address.  There are still the major players finding a lot, but it looks much more diverse now.


[08-Nov-18 08:12 AM] Marcin#0065
Bitcoin had no ico at all. 
I know the history of bitcoin, but we cant compare bitcoin to arweave, it makes no sense at that point. 
If you all feel comfortable with that situation, it may be so, but i did took my right to tell my opinion and i do not like the idea of havin few hyper computer cluster doing almost all hashing. Im afraid it will end up with few people deciding what will be saved and stored and what will be declined


[08-Nov-18 08:12 AM] Marcin#0065
Mike, i hope it will go on like that, would love to see many people participating


[08-Nov-18 08:14 AM] Mike#2447
It could also be one big guy who previously had 10 machines on one address, now has 10 machines on 10 different wallets 😝


[08-Nov-18 08:14 AM] Vilenarios#8742
maybe - and maybe hes operating for a huge loss at the moment because he spent so much on gear


[08-Nov-18 08:15 AM] Marcin#0065
The result will be like bitcoin, only big cluster will be left , since small personal computer do not make any economical sense to let them run. 
And since arweave is not about hashing only, mainly about storing, the result will be few big player left who decide what is stored in the weave


[08-Nov-18 08:15 AM] Vilenarios#8742
im thinking though that the best single node competition will be top end CPUs only


[08-Nov-18 08:15 AM] Vilenarios#8742

[08-Nov-18 08:16 AM] Mike#2447
Someone needs to write some Erlang pool software.


[08-Nov-18 08:37 AM] Vilenarios#8742

[08-Nov-18 08:38 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I wonder how it would fare mining AR - but its highly doubtful it would be profitable


[08-Nov-18 08:39 AM] Vilenarios#8742
storage pools will be key for arweave - the first guy to develop Erlang pool software can take the 2% dev fee for each AR mined  


[08-Nov-18 01:32 PM] tiamat#9131
@Marcin When people will start using the weave for storing lots of files, some big miners will have a different file policy than you, so they won't have all blocks because they deny some kind of files (wikileaks let's say). When you will need such recall blocks, there will be less miners and higher chances. So good signs for decentralization  


[08-Nov-18 01:36 PM] tiamat#9131
what happened with uzi? no more 10 blocks combos?


[08-Nov-18 02:37 PM] Vilenarios#8742
How do we implement a file policy?


[09-Nov-18 07:47 AM] Vilenarios#8742

[09-Nov-18 07:47 AM] Vilenarios#8742
But now i noticed that my block count is increasing beyond the current block height... why does it do this @arweave-sam ?


[09-Nov-18 08:05 AM] Marcin#0065
maybe you have many double numbered blocks, which you produced, by didnt get accepted, same for all peers too, i guess?


[09-Nov-18 08:26 AM] Mike#2447
That is my thought as well.  You have probably mined many blocks, but not had them accepted by the network, so you are left with many duplicates.


[09-Nov-18 08:28 AM] Vilenarios#8742
ew, so is there a "deduplicate" command?


[09-Nov-18 08:31 AM] Mike#2447
I feel like Sam just mentioned it a week or two ago, but I can't find it with the search function.


[09-Nov-18 09:04 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@Vilenarios `ar_cleanup:all()` is what you want, I beleive


[09-Nov-18 09:04 AM] arweave-sam#9630
They won't be your blocks, but mostly other people's abandoned uncle blocks.


[09-Nov-18 09:30 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Thank you sir.


[09-Nov-18 09:51 AM] Marcin#0065
Any way to just write down new blocks, when they are officially accepted? I have no interest in downloading useless blocks, nor is it needed inside the network i guess? It produces traffic for no reason. Its maybe not a huge issue now, now scaling up the number of miners in the future, there will be a big part of the traffic just for the non-usable double blocks? Am i wrong?


[09-Nov-18 09:53 AM] Marcin#0065
Or a checkup afterwards everytime a new block arrives? Wont help for the traffic inside the network, but will keep the disk clearer and maybe reduces future trafffic of double blocks


[09-Nov-18 12:11 PM] ATLAS#7218
If you dont get the new block you can't start mining. And there is no such thing as confirmed. You can put number of confirmations you require but even 100 confirmed block can be rejected.


[09-Nov-18 12:11 PM] ATLAS#7218
Officially accepted thing is nowhere to be found in crypto


[09-Nov-18 12:15 PM] tiamat#9131
good point baz


[09-Nov-18 12:16 PM] tiamat#9131
theoretically a longer chain could come up tomorrow and you can have 10.000 last blocks being invalid


[09-Nov-18 12:26 PM] Mike#2447
Didn't the Zencash guys just propose a fix for that loophole?


[09-Nov-18 01:37 PM] Marcin#0065
i dont mean the newest block, im talking about all the blocks which are produced and not cleaned up tll now. if every miner keeps many blocks which have the same block number, why spreading those blocks around the network then? what are they needed for then? every potential new miner will download those block too then?


[09-Nov-18 01:55 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I didn’t try the cleanup yet but if it works well enough I’ll just run that every week. Problem solved.


[10-Nov-18 12:39 AM] tiamat#9131
@arweave-sam  release 17 works so much better, I hardly noticed any fork since update


[10-Nov-18 04:57 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Works better but less blocks being found/mined. Guess the network/competition is growing which is a great thing.


[11-Nov-18 10:21 AM] Marcin#0065
getting that error:

any idea what to do?

=WARNING REPORT==== 11-Nov-2018::17:19:02 ===
The on_load function for module jiffy returned:
{error,{bad_lib,"Library version (2.13) not compatible (with 2.12)."}}


[11-Nov-18 10:22 AM] ATLAS#7218
recompiling might solve it


[11-Nov-18 10:26 AM] Marcin#0065
how?


[11-Nov-18 10:26 AM] ATLAS#7218
make clean
make all


[11-Nov-18 10:27 AM] ATLAS#7218
make clean didnt remove some files completely. Not sure if they fixed it


[11-Nov-18 10:27 AM] Marcin#0065
thx


[11-Nov-18 10:28 AM] ATLAS#7218
try deleting jiffy.o file if it doesnt work. not sure where it was.


[11-Nov-18 10:28 AM] Marcin#0065
still problem present


[11-Nov-18 10:29 AM] Marcin#0065
its in lib


[11-Nov-18 10:29 AM] Marcin#0065
lib-jiffy-c_src


[11-Nov-18 10:29 AM] Marcin#0065
what happens by deleting it?


[11-Nov-18 10:29 AM] ATLAS#7218
forces recompiling.


[11-Nov-18 10:30 AM] ATLAS#7218
make clean should delete it but it didnt work before.


[11-Nov-18 10:30 AM] Marcin#0065
okay, ill delete it


[11-Nov-18 10:31 AM] Marcin#0065
i think it worked out with "sudo -s"


[11-Nov-18 10:31 AM] Marcin#0065
the deleting


[11-Nov-18 10:31 AM] ATLAS#7218
wdym?


[11-Nov-18 10:31 AM] ATLAS#7218
ah


[11-Nov-18 10:32 AM] Marcin#0065
miner is working now again well


[11-Nov-18 10:32 AM] Marcin#0065
baz man, thx for help


[11-Nov-18 10:33 AM] ATLAS#7218
np


[11-Nov-18 10:35 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Thanks, @ATLAS !


[11-Nov-18 11:21 AM] JW#2445
Hi guys I am a mining virgin, but when I see a performance rate appear does that mean I am mining for this great project?


[11-Nov-18 11:24 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hey @JW ! Welcome to the Arweave community :).


[11-Nov-18 11:24 AM] arweave-sam#9630
When you say 'performance rate', what do you mean exactly?


[11-Nov-18 11:24 AM] ATLAS#7218
Sam can you check your pm?


[11-Nov-18 11:25 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@ATLAS will do


[11-Nov-18 11:27 AM] JW#2445
when I typed in ./arweave-server benchmark I saw performance rates appearing


[11-Nov-18 11:28 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Ah


[11-Nov-18 11:29 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You need to run `./arweave-server peer xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx mine mining_addr yyyyyyyyyyyyy` in order to start the miner


[11-Nov-18 11:29 AM] JW#2445
I did


[11-Nov-18 11:29 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Ok


[11-Nov-18 11:29 AM] JW#2445
I need to check if the port is open


[11-Nov-18 11:30 AM] JW#2445
I want to chek if I am actually mining


[11-Nov-18 11:30 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The benchmark mode does not connect to the network, it just shows your hashing rate


[11-Nov-18 11:30 AM] JW#2445
AHa! Good to know


[11-Nov-18 11:31 AM] JW#2445
How can I check if the linux machine is set up correctly for mining Arweave?


[11-Nov-18 11:34 AM] arweave-sam#9630
After you start the miner, can you access http://[your external IP]:1984/info in your browser?


[11-Nov-18 11:54 AM] JW#2445
Unable to connect


[11-Nov-18 11:54 AM] JW#2445
Perhaps I need some portforwarding as well


[11-Nov-18 11:58 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yes, you will need to forward 1984 on your router to your local machine's IP


[11-Nov-18 11:58 AM] arweave-sam#9630
And make sure that your local machine's firewall has that port open


[11-Nov-18 11:59 AM] JW#2445
firewall is open. Now checking the router


[11-Nov-18 11:59 AM] JW#2445
it is TCP right?


[11-Nov-18 12:00 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep!


[11-Nov-18 12:37 PM] JW#2445
@arweave-sam  how long does  ./arweave-server peer xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx mine mining_addr yyyyyyyyyyyyy rus before it is finished?


[11-Nov-18 12:38 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It will run indefinitely while you are mining


[11-Nov-18 12:38 PM] JW#2445
But in my terminal it will not go back to prompt?


[11-Nov-18 12:42 PM] JW#2445
@arweave-sam  will my prompt return in my terminal


[11-Nov-18 12:42 PM] JW#2445
I see some progress reports, but it will not return to prompt


[11-Nov-18 12:43 PM] JW#2445
only get "1>"


[11-Nov-18 12:46 PM] arweave-sam#9630
This is the expected behaviour. If you would like to run the mine in a way that allows you to detach the terminal I would advise that you use screen or tmux.


[11-Nov-18 12:48 PM] JW#2445
Thank you for you reply. Does this mean I am mining now? I am not able to access  http://[your external IP]:1984/info


[11-Nov-18 12:55 PM] arweave-sam#9630
If your machine cannot be accessed by other members of the network, you won't be sent any new blocks, so you won't be able to keep up with the network


[11-Nov-18 12:55 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Are you confident that your router/firewall configuration is correct?


[11-Nov-18 12:56 PM] JW#2445
I will check again


[11-Nov-18 12:56 PM] arweave-sam#9630
There is a work around to this -- polling mode -- but it will lead to less efficient mining for you


[11-Nov-18 01:06 PM] JW#2445
@arweave-sam  My apologies but last check with you  


[11-Nov-18 01:06 PM] JW#2445
when I go to http://[your external IP]:1984/info I am getting: {"network":"arweave.N.1","version":3,"release":7,"height":0,"current":"not_joined","blocks":84,"peers":58,"queue_length":0}


[11-Nov-18 01:07 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Bingo!


[11-Nov-18 01:07 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Looking good


[11-Nov-18 01:07 PM] JW#2445
Thank you man! Also for your patience


[11-Nov-18 01:07 PM] arweave-sam#9630
No worries at all


[11-Nov-18 01:07 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Welcome to the network :D


[11-Nov-18 01:07 PM] JW#2445
Thnx man. I I have to leave the terminal open right?


[11-Nov-18 01:09 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep, or you can use screen or similar, detach the session and them close the terminal


[11-Nov-18 01:10 PM] JW#2445
yes I understand. Thanks again. Glad to be part of the network!


[11-Nov-18 01:12 PM] Marcin#0065
Dude, ur on release 7


[11-Nov-18 01:12 PM] Marcin#0065
Make an update :)


[11-Nov-18 01:12 PM] Marcin#0065
To release 17


[11-Nov-18 01:13 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Good spot @Marcin


[11-Nov-18 01:13 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yes


[11-Nov-18 01:13 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@JW we would advise that you upgrade to the latest version 1.5 release candidate.


[11-Nov-18 01:14 PM] arweave-sam#9630
You can do that by running `git fetch --all ; git checkout N.1.5.0.0-RC-6`


[12-Nov-18 04:29 AM] Marcin#0065
What process causes the "wroting block to disk:" reports in the log? Even when i cut my connection, thos report still continue popping up? I did an update of my router os, and i was clearly offline for a little while. But the miner log was going on as usual, not even an information there is no internet connection. Really strange


[12-Nov-18 04:43 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I would have to check how that is implemented but it is possible that you have downloaded the blocks already and they are in a queue to be written to disk


[12-Nov-18 04:43 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The 'WARN:' regarding no net connection also only comes up after ~90 minutes


[12-Nov-18 04:48 AM] ivhturp#3325
Hey @arweave-sam  , I am facing crashes once a while recently. I am using a 24 GB ram on this server but it crashed as it couldn't allocate around 3.6 GB. And crash dump file was around 8.7 GB ! Dump was still being written - I cancelled it in middle
```eheap_alloc: Cannot allocate 3936326656 bytes of memory (of type "old_heap").

Crash dump is being written to: erl_crash.dump... ```


[12-Nov-18 04:48 AM] ivhturp#3325
Isn't 8.7 GB crash dump file too big ?


[12-Nov-18 04:49 AM] tiamat#9131
@ivhturp  my record is 23 GB


[12-Nov-18 04:50 AM] ivhturp#3325
No complaint from me then @tiamat  😜


[12-Nov-18 04:51 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The dumps will contain all of the memory that has been allocated, so they can get quite large.

What version are you running, platform are you using,  and how much ram do you have @ivhturp


[12-Nov-18 04:52 AM] ATLAS#7218
Its normal for the mining client


[12-Nov-18 04:53 AM] ivhturp#3325
I was using N.1.5.0.0-RC-5. Just updated to RC-6. I am using Ubuntu 18.04  on a 24 GB one


[12-Nov-18 04:53 AM] arweave-sam#9630
RC-6 should help a lot with that @ivhturp


[12-Nov-18 04:53 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Please can you ping me if it persists?


[12-Nov-18 04:53 AM] ivhturp#3325
Sure, will do. Thanks @arweave-sam


[12-Nov-18 04:54 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Thanks!


[12-Nov-18 04:55 AM] ivhturp#3325
I have been facing  `WARNING: No foreign blocks received from network. Please check your internet connection.` as well from last couple of days. Can this be because of the peer list I hold or is it for sure because of the network connection?


[12-Nov-18 04:55 AM] ivhturp#3325
Could you please share the peers to be used as well.


[12-Nov-18 04:56 AM] arweave-sam#9630
That message shows when the node has not received any block announcement messages from the network for 90 minutes


[12-Nov-18 04:57 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The peers you list on the command line are only the trusted ones. After you join you find the other peers in the network naturally.


[12-Nov-18 04:58 AM] ivhturp#3325
Okay! What are the trusted ones   I am using **18.221.144.197  35.178.129.36 18.130.126.49 52.56.119.91  52.33.231.154  34.216.88.202  54.159.24.25**


[12-Nov-18 04:59 AM] arweave-sam#9630
That seems fine @ivhturp


[12-Nov-18 04:59 AM] ivhturp#3325
Great, thanks !


[12-Nov-18 05:09 AM] Vilenarios#8742
@ivhturp are you on windows 10?

[13-Nov-18 12:27 AM] Marcin#0065
Where can i check, what the difficulty means? We are seeing difficulties from 31 to 34 right now, but what does ist change? Is it the same as in other coin hashings too? All i know, the algor. is sha2 384


[13-Nov-18 12:35 AM] landers38#6190
hello guys


[13-Nov-18 12:36 AM] landers38#6190
i would like an example about how much you get in term of tokken (by day) and with what kind of computer, thx


[13-Nov-18 12:50 AM] Marcin#0065
Hmm, as far i understand, it all depends on ur internet connection much. In case ur having a good connection, u also need to compete against miners, who are in the network much longer and have a higher wildfire score (better latency and so on). Furthermore u are allowee to take part in the hashing, if u have the random recall block, so u need to download all blocks first to be fully mining. 
In case ur all food with that, a good multicore cpu (lets say 12 cores) may get you 2-3 blocks a day?


[13-Nov-18 12:52 AM] landers38#6190
i guess some people are actively mining here ? Any info ?


[13-Nov-18 02:44 AM] tiamat#9131
@Marcin difficulty increases when new blocks are found too quickly and decreases when they are found too slow


[13-Nov-18 02:49 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Thanks @tiamat


[13-Nov-18 02:50 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Looks like it peaks at 35 at the moment


[13-Nov-18 03:07 AM] tiamat#9131
it seems to work very well lately, as we have ~620 blocks/day, it was fluctuating much a few weeks ago


[13-Nov-18 03:07 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I would like to tweak it a bit at some point (perhaps in 2.0). It is ok, but I think we can do better :)


[13-Nov-18 03:07 AM] arweave-sam#9630
It is slightly too reactive


[13-Nov-18 03:14 AM] arweave-sam#9630
There are some very neat difficulty algorithms out there, but we have the added complexity that not every machine has every block, so we have to be careful with how much state is required in order to calculate the new difficulty.


[13-Nov-18 05:46 AM] ivhturp#3325
How do we know the wildfire score of a node?


[13-Nov-18 05:48 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@ivhturp  The other nodes peering with your node will each calculate a score for your node, but they won't expose it.


[13-Nov-18 06:08 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Does restarting the miner negatively affect your score? Does it reset it altogether?


[13-Nov-18 06:12 AM] arweave-sam#9630
No @Vilenarios


[13-Nov-18 06:12 AM] arweave-sam#9630
It may slightly negatively affect you if the node is offline for long, but the score will remain


[13-Nov-18 06:12 AM] onetoneband#6330
Hi, I'm running new node


[13-Nov-18 06:13 AM] onetoneband#6330
Please tell me for low long it will take to get reward&

[13-Nov-18 06:13 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Got it. Did it seems a miner reset job every 12 hours wouldn’t be bad. Especially since joining is super fast now.


[13-Nov-18 06:13 AM] Vilenarios#8742
What kind of CPU do you have?


[13-Nov-18 06:14 AM] onetoneband#6330
Are you skimg me ?


[13-Nov-18 06:14 AM] onetoneband#6330
8 cores on vsphere


[13-Nov-18 06:14 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Yes.


[13-Nov-18 06:14 AM] onetoneband#6330
16 gb ram


[13-Nov-18 06:14 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I’d say that’s good for a block or two a day depending if you have all the blocks or not. But results may vary...


[13-Nov-18 06:15 AM] Vilenarios#8742
My 24 core i7 sometimes gets like 5 or 6 a day, sometimes 1 or 2


[13-Nov-18 06:19 AM] onetoneband#6330
ok, I will move more hosts to the cluster and give this virtual machine more resoureces


[13-Nov-18 08:08 AM] onetoneband#6330
Guys, please tell me how I can access the minig wallet


[13-Nov-18 08:08 AM] onetoneband#6330
is it the same that server gives me when it is started


[13-Nov-18 08:10 AM] ATLAS#7218
You should create your own wallet using the chrome extension and use that for mining

@onetoneband It is hard to predict your mining reward because there is a lot of factors. Since you are just starting, you probably doesn't have any blocks. You would probably won't get any rewards for the first few days

Well, I'm building another node on 12 vcpu with 16Gb


[13-Nov-18 08:18 AM] onetoneband#6330
I will point it to the same wallet


[13-Nov-18 08:19 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Thats what ive been doing - however


[13-Nov-18 08:19 AM] onetoneband#6330
Am i doing right? Will it help to get more blocks?


[13-Nov-18 08:19 AM] Vilenarios#8742
it makes it more of a pain to see how much a given node actually earns


[13-Nov-18 08:19 AM] Vilenarios#8742
no, it wont help more blocks at least i dont think...


[13-Nov-18 08:19 AM] onetoneband#6330
Why"?


[13-Nov-18 08:19 AM] ATLAS#7218
You will mine more blocks for sure


[13-Nov-18 08:19 AM] Vilenarios#8742
oh really?


[13-Nov-18 08:20 AM] Vilenarios#8742
i thought wallet address didnt matter when it came to wildfire score


[13-Nov-18 08:20 AM] ATLAS#7218
Yeah it doesnt matter


[13-Nov-18 08:20 AM] onetoneband#6330
Yeah, It won't nring the same block together, but different blocks in different time


[13-Nov-18 08:20 AM] onetoneband#6330
Do we have any russian speaker? I'm sure we have


[13-Nov-18 08:20 AM] ATLAS#7218
But because you have 2 nodes, you will mine more than your 1 node. Did I understand your question correctly?


[13-Nov-18 08:22 AM] onetoneband#6330
Yeas, that  right, it is pretty simple logic. I decided to do an experiment with different servers, first one is 6 CPUs on which I stupidly ran a 8 vCPU  and it is doing its job right now, Maybe I will reboot it and set 6 vCPU just not to have some overhead issues


[13-Nov-18 08:23 AM] onetoneband#6330
I did centos installtion, btw, and commited modified install script


[13-Nov-18 08:23 AM] onetoneband#6330
Next one is Ubuntu with 12 vCPUs


[13-Nov-18 08:23 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Im very interested to hear your results


[13-Nov-18 08:24 AM] Vilenarios#8742
you can do ./arweave-server benchmark to see raw hashrate


[13-Nov-18 08:24 AM] Vilenarios#8742
also when you actually run your miner, it is suggested to use the max_miners parameter


[13-Nov-18 08:24 AM] Vilenarios#8742
and set it to something like -5 or 6 CPUs than what you actually have...


[13-Nov-18 08:24 AM] Vilenarios#8742
but you will have to view your performance and tune it to suit you best


[13-Nov-18 08:25 AM] onetoneband#6330
How long does it take to  see the benchmark?


[13-Nov-18 08:25 AM] Vilenarios#8742
or else it will just be 100% CPU all the time and slow as hell


[13-Nov-18 08:25 AM] Vilenarios#8742
takes maybe a minute


[13-Nov-18 08:25 AM] onetoneband#6330
ah, not a big deal


[13-Nov-18 08:25 AM] Vilenarios#8742
nope.  it doesnt show you your disk or network performance though


[13-Nov-18 08:26 AM] onetoneband#6330
Well I spent a lto of time configuring those new instances just because I alwas  forget  network config syntax and switching from one OS to another doesn't help with speed


[13-Nov-18 08:26 AM] onetoneband#6330
Well, I'm going to run a becnhamrk - i will tell you soon

Yeah i spent way to much time messing around with different VM types as well, but i dont have many resources to play with


[13-Nov-18 08:28 AM] Vilenarios#8742
kinda low hash rate

ya it only shows 1 core hsh rate


[13-Nov-18 08:33 AM] onetoneband#6330
ah


[13-Nov-18 08:33 AM] onetoneband#6330
so it is better to increase number


[13-Nov-18 08:33 AM] onetoneband#6330
ok


[13-Nov-18 08:33 AM] Vilenarios#8742
yup


[13-Nov-18 08:40 AM] Vilenarios#8742
what kinda cpu on your vm host?


[13-Nov-18 08:42 AM] onetoneband#6330
Intel® E5-2620v2-2.1Ghz


[13-Nov-18 08:42 AM] onetoneband#6330

so now you just got to let it run and download all the blocks

@Vilenarios To trace my steps. I opened up a new terminal session to do the upgrade. I close the running Arweave. Is this correct approach?


[13-Nov-18 03:52 PM] Vilenarios#8742
yes


[13-Nov-18 03:53 PM] Vilenarios#8742
you have to run the gt fetch from the arweave directory


[13-Nov-18 03:53 PM] JW#2445

[14-Nov-18 10:23 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hey guys,

The 1.5.0.0 final release has now been tagged. There were no changes between the sixth release candidate and the final release (apart from the release and version numbers).

1.5 feature recap:
- ~95% reduction in block size
- ~95% reduction in network traffic
- 5-10x faster block verification
- New miner-friendly logging

In total, the 1.5 release has 17,500 individual line changes from the prior major release.

Thanks again to all of our community testers! It is exciting to see our community grow as it has over the last month or so.

Looking ahead:

1.6: The first fork of the Arweave network.

We are well on the way to delivering ‘blockweave 2.0’, the focus of our work since the launch of the main net back in June. The first stage of this journey, ‘tiny-blocks’, was shipped as part of version 1.5. Version 1.6 will perform a small protocol upgrade at block height 95,000, implementing the following features:
- Minor changes to the difficulty algorithm.
- Faster independent hash verification.
- Unbalanced merkle tree roots for O(1) block hash list verification.
- Redistribution of block rewards not distributed in the soft-on-boarding period across the rest of year one, inline with our originally published inflation schedule.

How will this work?

The Arweave team will send you an email (as well as a message here) a few thousand blocks before the upgrade takes place. You will then need to update and restart your miner. Once the appropriate height is reached, the new features will come into effect.


[14-Nov-18 10:32 AM] patrick#8648
Sweet thanks sam! So essentially all of the miners that mined blocks that were mined in the soft-on-boarding will receive their reward? Since genesis? Does this mean the team gets most of them?


[14-Nov-18 10:40 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Awesome update Sam.


[14-Nov-18 10:41 AM] Marcin#0065
no, there will be just higher reward per block patrick


[14-Nov-18 10:42 AM] patrick#8648
okok thx marcin


[14-Nov-18 10:43 AM] patrick#8648

after joining the network?


[14-Nov-18 10:52 AM] Marcin#0065
i tried it that way, but i cant see anything happening, not sure if i did it correctly


[14-Nov-18 10:53 AM] Vilenarios#8742
That command doesn’t seem to do anything for me. I have almost 2k blocks extra.


[14-Nov-18 10:53 AM] Marcin#0065
same here  


[14-Nov-18 10:58 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Did you run `ar_cleanup:all().` with the dot?


[14-Nov-18 10:58 AM] Marcin#0065
nope


[14-Nov-18 10:58 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Ah


[14-Nov-18 10:58 AM] Marcin#0065
xD


[14-Nov-18 10:58 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Haha


[14-Nov-18 10:59 AM] patrick#8648
lolol


[14-Nov-18 10:59 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep, you need the dot afterwards or it won't execute


[14-Nov-18 10:59 AM] patrick#8648
erlang REPL


[14-Nov-18 10:59 AM] patrick#8648
a bit of a pain imo :p


[14-Nov-18 10:59 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@patrick Yep XD


[14-Nov-18 10:59 AM] patrick#8648
i like the autocomplete tho


[14-Nov-18 11:00 AM] Marcin#0065
i did restart my miner after few days constant running. now its showing me that spam of : "writing block to disk" again every 2 seconds


[14-Nov-18 11:00 AM] Marcin#0065
what its doing? im already way over the max block heigh


[14-Nov-18 11:01 AM] Marcin#0065
it stopped showing those messaged few days before


[14-Nov-18 11:01 AM] arweave-sam#9630
It will be working its way back through the list checking what it has/doesn't have


[14-Nov-18 11:01 AM] arweave-sam#9630
It will stop once it has covered the whole weave again


[14-Nov-18 11:02 AM] Marcin#0065
lol.... so no more restarting miner again  


[14-Nov-18 11:02 AM] arweave-sam#9630
At this point it is probably best to just not pass the `enable disk_logging` flag @Marcin


[14-Nov-18 11:02 AM] Marcin#0065
untill block 95k xD


[14-Nov-18 11:02 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Then you won't see the message


[14-Nov-18 11:02 AM] Marcin#0065
ahh year correctly, i still have that message in my command, thx, totally forgot about it


[14-Nov-18 11:04 AM] Marcin#0065
ar_cleanup:all().
doing its job now, runnign like crazy, around 20-30 blocks a second?


[14-Nov-18 11:04 AM] Marcin#0065
ahh wait, its half the number


[14-Nov-18 11:08 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep, it is just loading the block into memory and then writing it again -- forcing it into the latest format (whatever that happens to be)

Hi Sam, I am seeing error messages like NodeWorkerError and NodeError. Once I start getting this error,  I am not receiving any blocks. Can you please help me .


[14-Nov-18 08:16 PM] ivhturp#3325
If I restart, it mines for a while. Once it encounters the above errors,  "No foreign blocks received from network" alert is shown


[15-Nov-18 03:01 AM] tiamat#9131
are you running the latest version? I had those on previous versions, not anymore

Hello! I've tried to run mining on my Ubuntu emulator installed on Windows and it gives me the next error. Does somebody know how to fix it?

Hi Andrei! What version of the software are you running?


[15-Nov-18 07:26 AM] HeroIs0#9206
I don't clearly understand the question. Do you mean the characteristics of my PC or version of Arweave client?


[15-Nov-18 07:42 AM] ivhturp#3325
@tiamat  Yes I'm running latest release 1.5


[15-Nov-18 07:42 AM] ivhturp#3325
I believe I am facing it from 1.5-RC 4 or 5


[15-Nov-18 07:50 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@ivhturp You should upgrade to the stable version. 1.5-RC6 was the latest RC before stable release was made yesterday.


[15-Nov-18 07:56 AM] Marcin#0065
Id like to suggest, that a cleanup of orphan blocks shouldnt take longer than 24 hours :D nobody will do a cleanup that way


[15-Nov-18 08:35 AM] Mike#2447
I didn't actually see it posted anywhere, so if anyone is unsure, the command to upgrade to the latest release is:
`git fetch --all ; git checkout N.1.5.0.0`

[15-Nov-18 09:11 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Thanks, Mike! Very good point


[16-Nov-18 12:01 AM] ivhturp#3325
@arweave-martin I am using N.1.5.0.0. i was just saying I started facing the issue from RC-4 and it still persists even after checking out the N.1.5.0.0 release


[16-Nov-18 12:43 AM] ATLAS#7218
My miner ran nonstop since RC-6


[16-Nov-18 12:44 AM] ATLAS#7218
So I'm not familiar with the issues in RC-6. Can you post the error log in more details?


[16-Nov-18 02:20 AM] tiamat#9131
did you restart the miner after latest checkout? @ivhturp


[16-Nov-18 02:21 AM] tiamat#9131
again, I had exactly the same issue but since RC-6 it runs smooth


[16-Nov-18 03:35 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@ivhturp So what do the error messages look like? The ones with "NodeWorkerError" and "NodeError".


[16-Nov-18 07:52 AM] ivhturp#3325
@tiamat Yes, I did restart several times but I'm still facing the issue. @ATLAS Lucky you   
@arweave-martin Sending message in DM


[16-Nov-18 07:54 AM] ivhturp#3325
@tiamat Did you clear any files. Did updating the code and restart worked for you straight away. 
I did copy the entire arweave folder long back from different node. Can this be an issue?  I started facing these issues after a while though


[16-Nov-18 07:56 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I would only copy blocks/txs/wallet_lists


[16-Nov-18 07:56 AM] Vilenarios#8742
dont copy the whoel folder


[16-Nov-18 07:59 AM] ivhturp#3325
Hmm. Would that create any issues?


[16-Nov-18 08:00 AM] Vilenarios#8742
It may... ive had issues every time ive done it


[16-Nov-18 08:00 AM] Vilenarios#8742
so i would rename your arweave folder to like arweave2


[16-Nov-18 08:00 AM] Vilenarios#8742
pull a fresh copy, make all


[16-Nov-18 08:00 AM] Vilenarios#8742
then copy blocks/txs/wallet_lists


[16-Nov-18 08:00 AM] ATLAS#7218
I copied all and it was fine


[16-Nov-18 08:02 AM] ivhturp#3325
Okay, let me give a try. Thanks @Vilenarios @ATLAS


[16-Nov-18 08:26 AM] tiamat#9131
yeah, it can be an issue, start with a clean copy, not even blocks/wallets, now is pretty fast and you will get them easier back


[16-Nov-18 08:59 AM] ivhturp#3325
What is the optimal number for max_miners for a 24 core machine?


[16-Nov-18 08:59 AM] ivhturp#3325
How are you guys configuring this value


[16-Nov-18 09:00 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I do 16 max miners on my 24 core


[16-Nov-18 09:00 AM] ivhturp#3325
@tiamat Wouldn't it take a week's time to download all of them 🙃


[16-Nov-18 09:02 AM] ivhturp#3325
How did u arrive at 16?


[16-Nov-18 09:03 AM] ivhturp#3325
I mean why not 12 or 18.. Based on load ?


[16-Nov-18 09:06 AM] ATLAS#7218
Too much load when mining will backfire your performance


[16-Nov-18 09:07 AM] ATLAS#7218
And of course, you want as much as core as possible to have  a nice hashrate


[16-Nov-18 09:07 AM] ATLAS#7218
So without overloading your cpu, you should find the optimal limit


[16-Nov-18 09:09 AM] ATLAS#7218
Its not heat issue, but it gets behind the network pretty easily because it hinders other processes


[16-Nov-18 09:10 AM] ivhturp#3325
I was deciding based on system load. So I was running with 22 or 23


[16-Nov-18 09:10 AM] ATLAS#7218
out of 24?


[16-Nov-18 09:10 AM] ivhturp#3325
Yeah


[16-Nov-18 09:10 AM] ATLAS#7218
not a goo didea


[16-Nov-18 09:10 AM] ATLAS#7218
it should be at most 20


[16-Nov-18 09:10 AM] ATLAS#7218
It will look fine without any errors, but it will mostly be left behind the network.


[16-Nov-18 09:11 AM] ATLAS#7218
And hence, start mining after everyone else


[16-Nov-18 09:11 AM] ATLAS#7218

Can we form a pool of nodes for mining?


[16-Nov-18 09:21 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Its possible, but the software doesnt exist yet


[16-Nov-18 09:31 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@ivhturp With your 24 CPU cores I think you will get a few mining rewards everyday anyway, so a pool wouldn't be very helpful.


[16-Nov-18 09:57 AM] ivhturp#3325
Yes indeed.. I just wanted to link all my nodes


[16-Nov-18 10:14 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Ive yet to test having multiple nodes read/write the same blocks folder


[16-Nov-18 10:14 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I imagine it will fail because all the nodes will try to write the same block at the same time


[17-Nov-18 02:12 AM] awkweird#6550
Have you guys tried the purge command yet?


[17-Nov-18 02:12 AM] awkweird#6550
Do i need to stop the mining in order to clean the blocks out?


[17-Nov-18 02:12 AM] ATLAS#7218
I dont think so


[17-Nov-18 02:13 AM] ATLAS#7218
Didn't try it. But mining client should not care about *fake* blocks anyway


[17-Nov-18 07:07 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Ive tried the purge command - it runs for many hours, but seems to do nothing.  I have around 1900 blocks extra


[17-Nov-18 07:11 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep @Vilenarios , Marcin reported a similar experience -- we are looking into it.

Hi guys, just getting started mining and so far so good.  I'll probably have 20 beginner questions, here's #1
Is there any benefit in staking AR? From the whitepaper I assume not.

[19-Nov-18 12:11 AM] Marcin#0065
Staking ar does not give u any benefits for mining. Also no other benefits

Hey there, I was going I could start mining with a Raspberry Pi as I understood the hard drive space was the important factor. what are your thoughts/advices/inputs ?


[19-Nov-18 02:07 AM] courtcircuit#8002
cheers


[19-Nov-18 02:11 AM] ATLAS#7218
At least 100GB is recommended.


[19-Nov-18 02:11 AM] ATLAS#7218
And cpu is also a big factor. So probably you won't be able to get much reward.


[19-Nov-18 03:59 AM] Marcin#0065
Every time a new block has to be mined, a so called recall block is chosen randomnly. If you own the recall block, you are qualified to start hashing. The more space you have, the more blocks you can keep, therefore you can start mining more often. Space and cpu power are both important. Also a good internet connection is recommendet.

{Reactions}
  

[19-Nov-18 05:03 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I highly doubt a raspberry pi would ever find a block


[19-Nov-18 05:05 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Could be a fun project to get working but without a true way to “combine them” to act as a single miner with a single storage back end, then it probably won’t generate any profit.

Any ideas what I can check to optimise, after 36 hours I barely mined any AR and have 16 cpu with 12 miners
The system is way underutilized, at times a single core goes to 100%, sometimes more, but otherwise idle.
Is it just due to being in the early stage and everyone has similar now? 

System load:  0.09
Memory usage: 1%

From arweave benchmark:
Performance rate: 1464986h/s/core.


[20-Nov-18 12:13 AM] chriscord#4741
Hello. I'm in the process of setting up my miner and would like to create a wallet separate from my rig. What is the recommended (most secure) wallet for storing Arweave tokens? Is it the Chrome extension?


[20-Nov-18 01:24 AM] Marcin#0065
@taariq do you own all current blocks?


[20-Nov-18 01:25 AM] Marcin#0065
Probably your machine doesnt own the recall blocks and doesnt even start hashing. Ot will be better over time


[20-Nov-18 01:30 AM] chriscord#4741
@Marcin I just started my miner and I keep seeing "could_not_start_mining". Even after restarting the miner. Can I expect it to go away eventually?


[20-Nov-18 01:31 AM] chriscord#4741
The miner has done one set of [Stage 1/3] and [Stage 2/3]


[20-Nov-18 01:48 AM] Marcin#0065
You could not start mining, because you didnt own the recall block probably


[20-Nov-18 01:49 AM] Marcin#0065
Check 127.0.0.1:1984 on your mining machine in the browser to see how many blocks ur currently keeping


[20-Nov-18 01:51 AM] Marcin#0065
It could take some while untill you downloaded all blocks. I cannot say how long exactly, but i think its a matter of days


[20-Nov-18 02:00 AM] chriscord#4741
I just started about an hour ago. So probably still downloading blocks. I'll check 127.0.0.1:1984 to confirm. Thanks!


[20-Nov-18 02:20 AM] chriscord#4741
It says I have 559 blocks and 61 peers. I guess I have some ways to go


[20-Nov-18 02:53 AM] ivhturp#3325
@chriscord  Your chance of starting the mining workers is number of blocks you hold / total number of blocks  = 559/85000 which is less than 1%. Keep it running for couple of days - It will work fine


[20-Nov-18 02:54 AM] ivhturp#3325
Stage 1/3 - Miner started. 
Stage 2/3 - Candidate block is found
Stage 3/3 - Block is accepted by the network


[20-Nov-18 03:18 AM] chriscord#4741
@ivhturp thanks, I'll hang tight for a couple of days


[20-Nov-18 03:28 AM] taariq#2485
Thanks again @Marcin , guess I got lucky with the first AR, still less than 10% mined

Hey @chriscord , we recommend creating a wallet with the Arweave web extension if you're looking for something more secure. The Arweave wallet will generate a key file which you can store offline and encrypt as you wish.

@taariq np, just let the machine run to keep downloading blocks :)


[20-Nov-18 09:33 AM] ggbb777#2026
@arweave-sophie    do i need all blocks to start seeing rewards ?


[20-Nov-18 09:34 AM] Vilenarios#8742
In order to begin mining, you must have a recall block.


[20-Nov-18 09:34 AM] ggbb777#2026
its mining


[20-Nov-18 09:34 AM] Vilenarios#8742
So if you have 0 out of 80k blocks, then your chance of even mining is 0


[20-Nov-18 09:34 AM] Vilenarios#8742
once you begin mining, it doesnt matter how many blocks you have


[20-Nov-18 09:34 AM] ggbb777#2026
its  7k   from80


[20-Nov-18 09:35 AM] ggbb777#2026
so even if I have allof them - doesnt affect ?


[20-Nov-18 09:35 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Your chances of beginning mining at 50% block height is 50% less than 100% block height, however your chances of mining reward is the same at 50% block height or 100%


[20-Nov-18 09:35 AM] Vilenarios#8742
yep, doesnt affect


[20-Nov-18 09:35 AM] Vilenarios#8742
in theory...


[20-Nov-18 09:36 AM] ggbb777#2026
so  if no tx in network and no stored data ,  where rewards coming from


[20-Nov-18 09:37 AM] ggbb777#2026
for mined block


[20-Nov-18 09:37 AM] Vilenarios#8742
yes


[20-Nov-18 09:37 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I would hope an exchange would bring more TXs and applications will bring more stored data


[20-Nov-18 09:38 AM] ggbb777#2026
so no reward , right ?


[20-Nov-18 09:38 AM] Vilenarios#8742
the reward is around 7AR


[20-Nov-18 09:38 AM] Vilenarios#8742
per block


[20-Nov-18 09:39 AM] ggbb777#2026
yes we hit one


[20-Nov-18 09:39 AM] ggbb777#2026
but only 1


[20-Nov-18 09:40 AM] ggbb777#2026
can you helpme to clear this out  @arweave-sophie  ?


[20-Nov-18 09:41 AM] ggbb777#2026
there are blocks with tx and without


[20-Nov-18 09:42 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
That's right @ggbb777 , you only need the recall block to begin hashing. The more blocks you store, the more chance you have of having said recall block.


[20-Nov-18 09:42 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Thanks for clarifying @Vilenarios ⛏


[20-Nov-18 09:42 AM] ggbb777#2026
ok ,this is clear


[20-Nov-18 09:42 AM] ggbb777#2026
there are blocks with tx and without


[20-Nov-18 09:42 AM] ggbb777#2026
so when miner is rewarded ?


[20-Nov-18 09:42 AM] ggbb777#2026
for both blocks of not


[20-Nov-18 09:47 AM] ATLAS#7218
Immediate


[20-Nov-18 09:48 AM] ATLAS#7218
You will be rewarded immediately after mining. But network might reject that you mined that block.


[20-Nov-18 09:48 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
There is a block reward system just like in bitcoin @ggbb777   


[20-Nov-18 09:49 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Ever since the latest updates, i almost never find that my blocks get rejected

@arweave-sophie can you check pm pls


[20-Nov-18 09:56 AM] ggbb777#2026
@arweave-sophie    ok , so any  mined block , with tx or without has same reward?


[20-Nov-18 09:59 AM] ggbb777#2026
whats is said in pdf is clear  but that info is missing


[20-Nov-18 09:59 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
You can get rewards for both transactions and mined blocks (that have been accepted by the network)


[20-Nov-18 10:00 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Good point,  I will add this info to the infographic!


[20-Nov-18 10:00 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I guess i kind of assume a block with TXs is worth more...


[20-Nov-18 10:00 AM] Vilenarios#8742
but i dont know


[20-Nov-18 10:00 AM] ggbb777#2026
yes we can assume but we dont know


[20-Nov-18 10:00 AM] ggbb777#2026
lets say no tx for  1 month


[20-Nov-18 10:01 AM] ggbb777#2026
whopays reward ?


[20-Nov-18 10:01 AM] ggbb777#2026
when network  is working in full mode , rewards come from fees


[20-Nov-18 10:02 AM] ggbb777#2026
now qty of  tx is very small


[20-Nov-18 10:05 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
That's right @Vilenarios . Simply put: the bigger the transaction, the higher the reward.


[20-Nov-18 10:07 AM] ggbb777#2026
how bigger @arweave-sophie  ? and is reward  for  mined block with 0 tx 7 AR ?


[20-Nov-18 10:17 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Inflation pays for the rewards, just like Bitcoin and Ethereum. With regards to the 0 transactions and 7AR - i'll have to get back to  you on this. Maybe @arweave-sam can help clarify this!


[20-Nov-18 10:33 AM] ggbb777#2026
@arweave-sophie    ok ,pls  , one more question  - lest say im running miner  and  finally downloaded  all blocks ,   if i start another miner , can i just  copy  directory with past blocks to another miner ?


[20-Nov-18 10:34 AM] ggbb777#2026
to  save time


[20-Nov-18 10:35 AM] Marcin#0065
Yes. But u can (in theory) only one miner per ip adress

{Reactions}
  

[20-Nov-18 10:35 AM] Marcin#0065
Since you neee to port forward port 1984 to one mac adress (eth port)


[20-Nov-18 10:36 AM] ggbb777#2026
@Marcin    regarding ip , i understand  , thanks  for info , btw have u tried this ?


[20-Nov-18 10:45 AM] Marcin#0065
U can connect as many miners you want to one ip adress to the outside world. But for communication in the network you do portforward a specific port to one port.


[20-Nov-18 10:46 AM] ggbb777#2026
no ,imean copying  blocks from one  miner to another


[20-Nov-18 11:34 AM] Marcin#0065
Ofc you can


[20-Nov-18 11:34 AM] Marcin#0065
I did it many times


[20-Nov-18 12:48 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Since Polling seems to be working well now, is it a hard requirement to have port 1984 open to the outside world?


[20-Nov-18 04:02 PM] vveljk#9869
What is the procedure to update to latest version?


[20-Nov-18 04:03 PM] vveljk#9869
I used: git fetch --all ; git checkout stable


[20-Nov-18 04:03 PM] vveljk#9869
and I still get version: 3


[20-Nov-18 04:04 PM] vveljk#9869
3 days ago I created new virtual with latest arweave and there I see version: 4


[20-Nov-18 04:09 PM] Vilenarios#8742
maybe try this


[20-Nov-18 04:09 PM] Vilenarios#8742
git fetch --all ; git checkout N.1.5.0.0


[20-Nov-18 04:36 PM] vveljk#9869
do I need to run make all after git fetch?


[20-Nov-18 04:37 PM] vveljk#9869
or does ./arweave-server compile what is needed?


[20-Nov-18 04:37 PM] vveljk#9869
@Vilenarios thank you...always here when needed  


[20-Nov-18 11:07 PM] awkweird#6550
Has the reward random function changed?2days and no block has been produced.


[21-Nov-18 12:51 AM] taariq#2485
After a while of running the blocks per hour decreases, and restarting gets  it up again. 
If I restart automatically every now and then, say hourly or every couple of hours, will this affect my ranking?


[21-Nov-18 12:51 AM] taariq#2485
Also got this warning and internet is fine, restart fixes it too...

[21-Nov-18 02:38 AM] ivhturp#3325
@taariq what you mean by blocks per hour decreases? Do you mean the number of blocks that are downloaded?


[21-Nov-18 02:39 AM] ivhturp#3325
w.r.t No foreign blocks received, Can you check if you are seeing any errors in `make log`


[21-Nov-18 06:21 AM] taariq#2485
The info endpoint gives the number of blocks and block height, I don't have all the blocks yet.
And I log this every hour to see how it's doing, after startup it can do hundreds per hour, after 5 hours or so, it drops to a few dozen.

Last log was block_height=86654, blocks=10038

The block height is always matching the explorer, at this rate blocks can take weeks.


[21-Nov-18 06:27 AM] Vilenarios#8742
i started a new node last night as well


[21-Nov-18 06:27 AM] Vilenarios#8742
and notice block download seems to stop as well


[21-Nov-18 11:09 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@taariq and @Vilenarios -- are you guys running in `polling` mode?


[21-Nov-18 11:11 AM] arweave-sam#9630
> Since Polling seems to be working well now, is it a hard requirement to have port 1984 open to the outside world?

Not a hard requirement, but by my basic mathematics you will mine _at least_ 6.6% less efficiently in polling mode


[21-Nov-18 11:11 AM] arweave-sam#9630
This is excluding the damage it will do to your WF score, too


[21-Nov-18 11:16 AM] ATLAS#7218
Wow polling is working now?


[21-Nov-18 11:17 AM] ATLAS#7218
I mean without continuously falling behind the network.

@arweave-india hello?


[21-Nov-18 11:18 AM] ATLAS#7218

[21-Nov-18 11:20 AM] arweave-india#5075
@ATLAS, Yes you did send me a PM yesterday but not one before that? Let me know if there is another outstanding query you have


[21-Nov-18 11:21 AM] arweave-india#5075
I'll let others discuss polling, as I'm not up to speed on that!


[21-Nov-18 11:24 AM] tiamat#9131
if port 1984 is closed you can't serve files, so how do you help the network?

When do I see [Stage 2/3] or even [Stage 3/3] ?


[21-Nov-18 11:51 AM] Vilenarios#8742
wow 6% less...  cant wait for multi-port to become available


[21-Nov-18 11:52 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@Vilenarios Me too! It would be very convenient to have the port feature working.  We're going to fix it at some point and then hopefully no one need the polling mode.


[21-Nov-18 11:56 AM] arweave-martin#1169
I'm not mining, btw. In case I gave that impression.

now it can not connect to network

ok  give me some time


[22-Nov-18 04:50 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@ggbb777 Basically, start the miner and when you see the errors stop it. Then you send me the latest file in the logs directory.


[22-Nov-18 06:43 AM] ggbb777#2026
@arweave-martin   i checked logs and they    r   empty  ??

there was error regarding log write


[22-Nov-18 07:26 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@ggbb777 Everytime you start the miner, a new logfile is created in the logs directory. Isn't this the case for you?

That explains why mnesia failed to start.

I've seen some mentions of "port forwarding" in previous discussions. Is this something the installer takes care of automatically or do I have to manually configure this? 

And if I have to, what should I do to configure it? Thanks


[22-Nov-18 03:28 PM] arweave-martin#1169
@chriscord  You need to make sure that the mining machine is reachable on TCP port 1984 from the Internet. So, if your miner is on a local network (i.e. behind a NAT), you need to configure your gateway to forward port 1984 to the miner's local IP address.


[22-Nov-18 08:57 PM] chriscord#4741
Got it. Thank you

Hey all,

Just a reminder that the version 1.6 protocol upgrade is scheduled for block 95,000 (estimated for 6am CET on Monday 2nd). We will be releasing the 1.6.0 client early next week, after which you will need to upgrade your mining client. We will keep you informed as things progress.

A brief recap of the new features in 1.6:

- Extremely fast ( _O_(1), for the nerds like us   ) independent hash and block list verification.
- Tweaks to the difficulty adjustment algorithm.
- Redistribution of soft on-boarding rewards over Y1.

Have a great weekend and happy mining!

@Vilenarios :+1: !


[24-Nov-18 07:14 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Speaking of data, I am thinking about building (in my 'spare time' :p) a kind of 'museum' on the permaweb that stores documents relating to the early days of cryptocurrency development. I have a copy some 199[4-6] NSA papers about digital cash systems, an archive of the cypherpunks mailing list (where many of the ideas that led to Bitcoin first surfaced), and a bunch of other early papers ready to upload.

I was wondering if anyone here might want to help with the collation and uploading of docs?


[24-Nov-18 07:31 AM] Vilenarios#8742
@arweave-sam  I don’t mind helping in my free time.  U gotta show me how to upload


[24-Nov-18 07:32 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Unless it’s a matter of me publishing them anywhere on the web and then just using the chrome plugin.


[24-Nov-18 11:16 AM] Marcin#0065
Im also here good for help


[24-Nov-18 11:35 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Awesome @Vilenarios @Marcin !


[24-Nov-18 11:36 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Regarding upload, @arweave-lev (not sure he has made a Discord account yet) built a bulk uploader for large files earlier, built into the miner, this week


[24-Nov-18 11:37 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@arweave-kyle is also building a simple file deployment tool which should be ready to test fairly soon


[24-Nov-18 11:38 AM] arweave-sam#9630
One thing that would be good is if we could get some help sourcing interesting materials


[24-Nov-18 11:40 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Maybe someone could start by looking at archiving the best bits of http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org


[24-Nov-18 11:40 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I am happy to provide AR for the archiving of course :)


[24-Nov-18 11:45 AM] Vilenarios#8742
A tool to upload files? Is it Christmas already?


[24-Nov-18 11:46 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I’ll do some digging to see anything of interest. Although I admit I have not been in this scene as long as you guys so I don’t have any cool material   


[24-Nov-18 11:48 AM] arweave-sam#9630
There is actually a file uploader embedded in the miner you are currently running


[24-Nov-18 11:48 AM] arweave-sam#9630
But you have to be willing to use the Erlang console at the moment


[24-Nov-18 11:49 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We are working on it :)


[24-Nov-18 11:49 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Never used erlang console. But I’m willing.


[24-Nov-18 11:49 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Need something else to learn to take my mind off bitcoin destruction.


[24-Nov-18 11:50 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Speaking of Christmas and consoles, there will be an 'Easter egg' in the 1.6 release -- a way of generating wallets that start with a certain prefix


[24-Nov-18 11:51 AM] ATLAS#7218
Wow so. much things


[24-Nov-18 11:51 AM] arweave-sam#9630

[24-Nov-18 11:51 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Like... Lots of time


[24-Nov-18 11:52 AM] ATLAS#7218
So it tries to get a certain address by brute force


[24-Nov-18 11:52 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep


[24-Nov-18 11:52 AM] ATLAS#7218
So this feature will be disabled after the event?


[24-Nov-18 11:53 AM] Vilenarios#8742
An estimate of how long to brute force first 3 chars of the wallet?


[24-Nov-18 11:53 AM] arweave-sam#9630
But it supports some different character sets (case sensitive/insensitive, l33t speak) so that the search space is smaller. 3 letters was fine on my machine, 4 will take awhile


[24-Nov-18 11:53 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Won't be disabled @ATLAS , but we don't plan to publicise it


[24-Nov-18 11:54 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Just an Easter egg for the mining community that chat to each other :D


[24-Nov-18 11:55 AM] ATLAS#7218
This week will be a long wait


[24-Nov-18 11:56 AM] ATLAS#7218
Too excited  


[24-Nov-18 11:57 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You can also give different lists of 'target' prefixes, which makes it much more likely you find a long one that you are interested in faster


[24-Nov-18 11:59 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@Vilenarios I think for a case insensitive 3 character one on a 56 thread machine it took ~20 minutes to find a hit


[24-Nov-18 12:00 PM] arweave-sam#9630
With a list of ~10 4 character targets  running overnight on that machine produced around 20 results


[24-Nov-18 12:03 PM] Vilenarios#8742
56 thread machine... totally jelly.


[24-Nov-18 12:04 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I’ll give it a try later tonite


[24-Nov-18 12:05 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Haha, old xeons are comparatively cheap :)


[24-Nov-18 12:06 PM] ATLAS#7218
I can help with the publication btw


[24-Nov-18 12:07 PM] ATLAS#7218
During my free time ofc. Decentralized newspaper or media platform built on arweave would be nice.


[24-Nov-18 12:07 PM] ATLAS#7218
Medium sort of thing


[24-Nov-18 12:07 PM] arweave-sam#9630
:+1: :+1: :+1:


[24-Nov-18 12:07 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I have been thinking about that for a while


[24-Nov-18 12:08 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Would be great


[24-Nov-18 12:08 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Just a case of getting time to hack it together/assign resources to it


[24-Nov-18 12:08 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We would give a very large bounty that one if someone built it :)


[24-Nov-18 12:11 PM] ATLAS#7218
I'm not familiar with such things but will give a try for a hobby. Will probably a shit tier project. But just for fun    


[24-Nov-18 12:26 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Awesome! @ATLAS


[24-Nov-18 12:26 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We would be extremely happy to support and show it off on our social media etc


[24-Nov-18 12:26 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Shit tier or not  


[24-Nov-18 12:40 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@ATLAS @Vilenarios @Marcin 

I have posted the first couple of entries for the 'cryptocurrency museum' (needs a better name!   ) in # on-the-arweave


[24-Nov-18 12:41 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Feel free to add stuff there, then we can go back and make an index of the links later  


[24-Nov-18 01:28 PM] bonkingbob#6212
I think I’m up and running on my Mac, successfully connected to the arweave network. How do I know if irs doing anything? It’s just been sitting there since with no status updates


[24-Nov-18 01:40 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Hey @bonkingbob


[24-Nov-18 01:40 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Welcome to the community  


[24-Nov-18 01:40 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Do you see messages like this in the terminal?

```
Saturday, 19:34:47: Joining the Arweave network...
Saturday, 19:35:13: Joined the Arweave network successfully.
Saturday, 19:36:28: [Stage 1/3] Successfully proved access to recall block. Starting to hash.
```


[24-Nov-18 01:41 PM] arweave-sam#9630
You can get more information about what the node is doing by running `make log` in another terminal in the same directory


[24-Nov-18 01:54 PM] bonkingbob#6212
Hmm didn’t get the third confirmation. Had to restart for an update so will try again once it’s  rebooted


[24-Nov-18 02:09 PM] tiamat#9131
You mean this "[Stage 1/3]" ? That's because you don't have the blocks yet, it's normal.


[24-Nov-18 05:24 PM] Mike#2447
I'm still seeing lots of the "no foreign blocks receive" errors.  At least once or twice per day.  The funny thing is that even on machines that are completely separate, in different cities, running on different ISPs, the messages start arriving at almost the exact same time, as if there's a trigger from the network itself.
Here are three of my machines, all starting around the same time:

Saturday, 15:50:57: WARNING: No foreign blocks received from network. Please check your internet connection.
Saturday, 15:51:28: WARNING: No foreign blocks received from network. Please check your internet connection.
Saturday, 15:51:54: WARNING: No foreign blocks received from network. Please check your internet connection.


[24-Nov-18 05:36 PM] Guntharian#2148
I am also receiving the same error.  WARNING: No foreign blocks received from network. Please check your internet connection.  It begins about 50 minutes after the server is started and then every hour on the hour relative to when it was started.  Internet connection is fine.  Running Ubuntu Virtual box on Windows 10 .  This error started showing up about a week ago I would say.  Anything I can do on my end to correct.? Proxy setting, updated start command with peers? It downloads blocks successfully for the first 50 minutes.


[24-Nov-18 11:59 PM] tiamat#9131
Are you running the latest release?

is it possible to launch second miner behind rooter ?


[25-Nov-18 04:02 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Yes, need to add the “polling” parameter.


[25-Nov-18 04:03 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Although it is approx 6% worse than not having port 1984 forwarded


[25-Nov-18 07:42 AM] Marcin#0065
Are you sure? Since its one public ip adress, how do you dfferenciate 2 computer from each other?


[25-Nov-18 12:19 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I have 5 miners behind a single public IP. Port forwarding to one, polling on the rest.


[25-Nov-18 12:19 PM] Vilenarios#8742
They all mine blocks successfully, although the best/most powerful miner has port forwarding.


[25-Nov-18 01:36 PM] Marcin#0065
Interesting :) do they all credit one ar adress too?


[25-Nov-18 03:06 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Ya I set them all to the same wallet, but that shouldn’t matter.


[25-Nov-18 07:35 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Hey miners! Friendly reminder... may be a good day for equipment tomorrow...

where can i find the dump file though?


[25-Nov-18 10:59 PM] ATLAS#7218
in the arweave folder


[26-Nov-18 12:21 AM] awkweird#6550
Is it the only a text file?


[26-Nov-18 12:25 AM] ATLAS#7218
not really. its bunch of binaries which has your memory data when the crash happened.


[26-Nov-18 08:01 AM] bonkingbob#6212
Is there any updates on the ‘no foreign blocks received’ error? Mine too is getting this after around an hour from spinning it up and every hour after that.


[26-Nov-18 11:44 AM] CryptoSam88#2377
i am getting "no foriegn blocks" error too. What's the workaround for this ?


[26-Nov-18 12:02 PM] ATLAS#7218
Check internet. Check firewall. Make sure your port 1984 is open


[26-Nov-18 12:03 PM] CryptoSam88#2377
Internet is ofcourse ok. Let me check the port. I guess I forgot to do the port forwarding to 1984. B


[26-Nov-18 12:03 PM] CryptoSam88#2377
Thanks for your help @ATLAS

np


[26-Nov-18 12:17 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I get that issue randomly across many of my nodes. It coincides with a port exhaustion error on my Windows 10 machines.


[26-Nov-18 12:17 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Polling and not polling.


[26-Nov-18 12:18 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Reboot fixes the problem for me.


[26-Nov-18 12:24 PM] ATLAS#7218
Probably because you are using single IP for 5 miner


[27-Nov-18 08:39 AM] awkweird#6550
How to check wallet transactions?


[27-Nov-18 08:39 AM] awkweird#6550
I use etherscan for specific tokens bur no idea how viewblock works


[27-Nov-18 08:41 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Hey @awkweird, you can search address, transaction or block via Viewblock - https://viewblock.i/arweave  


[27-Nov-18 08:47 AM] awkweird#6550
Yes Sophie, it shows the balance


[27-Nov-18 08:47 AM] awkweird#6550
However, I want to see the balance progression overtime as i mine


[27-Nov-18 08:52 AM] awkweird#6550
maybe it could be a mining log, how my machine been performing, how much rewards received etc.


[27-Nov-18 08:55 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Viewblock doesn’t log mining rewards as transactions because they’re generated rather then sent. Currently there’s no way to view your mining rewards, however you’ve raised a good point so I’ll have a chat to the team and see if it’s possible to implement something like this in the future ⛏


[27-Nov-18 08:58 AM] awkweird#6550
Thanks for the info, i hope it will be implemented in the future. Because its impossible to track my electricity fee and mining rate atm


[27-Nov-18 08:58 AM] awkweird#6550
Haha  


[27-Nov-18 09:04 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
No worries, i've forwarded your feedback onto the team!


[28-Nov-18 10:51 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hey @everyone ,

Arweave N.1.6.0.0 has now been released! You will need to make sure your miner is upgraded before block 95,000, when the new features will be activated.

You can update your miner by running:

`git fetch --all ; git checkout master ; git reset --hard N.1.6.0.0`

The new features in 1.6:

- Extremely fast ( O(1) ) independent hash and block list verification.
- Tweaks to the difficulty adjustment algorithm.
- Redistribution of soft on-boarding rewards over Y1 (in ‘network time’).

Bonus: A wallet name generator that allows you to find addresses that start with a given prefix.

Competition: We will be giving away 250 AR to the wallet with the ‘best’ name (completely subjective decision of the team, sorry XD) to mine a block before the activation of 1.6 at 95,000. Get generating!

{Reactions}
  

[28-Nov-18 11:08 AM] arweave-sam#9630
To generate a new wallet with a name that you are looking for, type the following after starting your node:

`app_namer:start(["pre1", "pre2", "pre3"], 4, l33t).` <ENTER>

Where 'pre1-3' are prefix strings for wallet addresses that you would like to find and 4 is the number of processes (subsequently, cores) to use to find the named wallet. The final argument is the type of dictionary to use: l33t ('text' speak, fastest to find, lowest quality), normal (matches without case), and strict (matches only exact strings).

could you gibe an example for the adress command? i get errors with that


[28-Nov-18 11:50 AM] Marcin#0065
let say "Honey" as prefix, how to build it? just to be idiotproof sure pls

wait, the stable is not the correct one  


[28-Nov-18 11:54 AM] Marcin#0065
git fetch —all ; git checkout master ; git reset —hard stable

i think that is wrong


[28-Nov-18 11:54 AM] Dentechr#5213
i think also


[28-Nov-18 11:54 AM] Marcin#0065
i got release 11 with that xD


[28-Nov-18 11:54 AM] Marcin#0065
big downgrade lol


[28-Nov-18 11:55 AM] Marcin#0065
i get strait to 
git checkout N.1.6.0.0


[28-Nov-18 11:56 AM] Dentechr#5213
you try that please


[28-Nov-18 11:58 AM] Marcin#0065
i did:

git fetch —all ; git checkout N.1.6.0.0 ; git reset —hard N.1.6.0.0

looks good so far


[28-Nov-18 11:59 AM] Dentechr#5213
let me try


[28-Nov-18 12:00 PM] Marcin#0065
i have the the "app_namer" file now, so i think im good with that version  


[28-Nov-18 12:00 PM] Dentechr#5213
yeah looks good

the question ist, where does the result will be copied, after u created a wallet_file?

looks good dent


[28-Nov-18 12:02 PM] Dentechr#5213
not shure what he means with that whole wallet name situation  


[28-Nov-18 12:02 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Thanks @Dentechr , @Marcin


[28-Nov-18 12:03 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Looks like the 'fetch --all' doesn't necessarily move the tag locally


[28-Nov-18 12:03 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I will amend the message above

[28-Nov-18 12:05 PM] Marcin#0065
do you have some statistics how long my monkey machine needs to type the given prefix?


[28-Nov-18 12:05 PM] Marcin#0065
how many signs for like 1-2 days of calculating? on around 22 threads?


[28-Nov-18 12:30 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Many


[28-Nov-18 12:30 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It all depends on how many characters you are looking for though


[28-Nov-18 12:31 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Might be reasonable to get one case-insensitive hit of a 5 character match in 36 hours or so on that kind of machine


[28-Nov-18 12:31 PM] Marcin#0065
i thought about the other way round, how many can i expect of 1 day of calculation?


[28-Nov-18 12:31 PM] Marcin#0065
okay thx  


[28-Nov-18 12:31 PM] arweave-sam#9630
But remember to specify lots of options if you are looking for long prefixes

[28-Nov-18 12:41 PM] arweave-sam#9630
> for you little competition there aint even time to get creative :S

Remember you need to mine a block, too -- don't take all your hashing power off the net  


[28-Nov-18 01:42 PM] Marcin#0065
does the prefix need to end with an "_" to seperate it from the rest of the adress?


[28-Nov-18 01:42 PM] Marcin#0065
just for the looks

What means "Redistribution of soft on-boarding rewards over Y1 (in ‘network time’)."?


[29-Nov-18 01:45 AM] Marcin#0065
There has been a time till block height 65700 when miners didnt get block rewards. 
Those rewards were somehow backed up and will be released now

Hi @tierralibre ! Yes that's the peer list currently in the mining getting started guide  


[29-Nov-18 09:21 AM] tierralibre#2740
ok.


[29-Nov-18 09:21 AM] tierralibre#2740
I am getting an error when I do make

already did a make clean


[29-Nov-18 09:23 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@tierralibre Try `make clean`  first.


[29-Nov-18 09:23 AM] tierralibre#2740
then make


[29-Nov-18 09:23 AM] arweave-martin#1169
aah, I see


[29-Nov-18 09:23 AM] tierralibre#2740
yes that was done


[29-Nov-18 09:23 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@tierralibre How did you install Erlang?


[29-Nov-18 09:24 AM] tierralibre#2740
apt


[29-Nov-18 09:24 AM] tierralibre#2740
I could use asdf


[29-Nov-18 09:25 AM] tierralibre#2740
yup erlang is not correctly insntalled


[29-Nov-18 09:25 AM] tierralibre#2740
doing again

lot's of changes in the last months I see  


[29-Nov-18 09:27 AM] tierralibre#2740
lot's of test coverage too


[29-Nov-18 09:28 AM] tierralibre#2740
how long does the first sync take now? couple of days?


[29-Nov-18 09:34 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@tierralibre Are you saying you started the miner without any existing blocks on disk?


[29-Nov-18 09:39 AM] tierralibre#2740
yes


[29-Nov-18 09:39 AM] tierralibre#2740
I had blocks but it was in multiple partitions and easily became a mess


[29-Nov-18 09:39 AM] tierralibre#2740
most likely lost a lot of proof of access advantge to. as they were initial blocks


[29-Nov-18 09:50 AM] arweave-martin#1169
I see. Luckily it's seems like it only takes a few days to download the blocks again for now. But when the weave is larger, you probably would like to be more careful deleting data.


[29-Nov-18 09:50 AM] tierralibre#2740
ofcourse


[29-Nov-18 09:50 AM] tierralibre#2740
this is why I wanted to come back now  


[29-Nov-18 09:51 AM] tierralibre#2740
I still need to find a better storage way. My provider only has drives of 150GB


[29-Nov-18 09:51 AM] tierralibre#2740
is multiple data stores going to be coming?


[29-Nov-18 09:51 AM] tierralibre#2740
like mutliple mounts?


[29-Nov-18 09:51 AM] tierralibre#2740
I used the FUSE things but when it breaks is super hard to recover

Good to see you again -- how is it going?  


[29-Nov-18 09:53 AM] tierralibre#2740
Going great! Finally life has stabilized  


[29-Nov-18 09:53 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Nice  


[29-Nov-18 09:53 AM] tierralibre#2740
one start-up died and had to find options


[29-Nov-18 09:53 AM] tierralibre#2740
EcoNet is doing super well with the Environment Relationship Management


[29-Nov-18 09:53 AM] tierralibre#2740
and I want to put all of our data on Arweave


[29-Nov-18 09:54 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Regarding mounts -- I would recommend custom Unix mounting for now


[29-Nov-18 09:54 AM] tierralibre#2740
And you? How are you?


[29-Nov-18 09:54 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Awesome!

Any news on elixiring the dev part? that would be really great.

That ticket is still open I am afraid


[29-Nov-18 09:56 AM] tierralibre#2740
I have been reading about property testing with PropEr and I see some erlang there.


[29-Nov-18 09:56 AM] arweave-sam#9630
PropEr is pretty cool


[29-Nov-18 09:56 AM] tierralibre#2740
 


[29-Nov-18 09:56 AM] tierralibre#2740
I now I can compile to beam


[29-Nov-18 09:56 AM] tierralibre#2740
I wonder how do I place those files so arweave can use them


[29-Nov-18 09:57 AM] tierralibre#2740
can a package be built for the  adt?


[29-Nov-18 09:57 AM] arweave-sam#9630
If they are in the ebin they will be loaded


[29-Nov-18 09:57 AM] tierralibre#2740
ok. I will investigate further.


[29-Nov-18 09:58 AM] tierralibre#2740

I think if Elixir doesn't mangle the function names too much, it should be fine


[29-Nov-18 10:01 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Should be able to tell by running `compiled_elixir_module_name:module_info(exports).` in an Erlang shell with the compiled Elixir module loaded.


[29-Nov-18 10:02 AM] tierralibre#2740
ok. I am trying see where do i get   Thank you Sam!


[29-Nov-18 10:16 AM] arweave-sam#9630
No problem -- let us know how it goes

HI guys. Trying to upgrade but getting hit with a crash report...

Could you please help me out?

[29-Nov-18 01:52 PM] JW#2445
Does this seem right to you?


[29-Nov-18 01:53 PM] JW#2445
@arweave-sam  Could you please be of any assitance?


[29-Nov-18 01:58 PM] chriscord#4741
@JW it should be `{"network":"arweave.N.1","version":5,"release":19` after the update. At least that's what I'm seeing


[29-Nov-18 02:00 PM] JW#2445
@chriscord so upgarde is not succesfull yet. What am I doing wrong?


[29-Nov-18 02:00 PM] JW#2445
any clue?


[29-Nov-18 02:09 PM] chriscord#4741
Not sure. But first kill the miner, then run the git commands posted by @arweave-sam


[29-Nov-18 02:09 PM] chriscord#4741
Then restart the miner


[29-Nov-18 02:10 PM] JW#2445
Done: v


[29-Nov-18 02:10 PM] chriscord#4741
Post any errors you see

But I have no clue hwat I did that made it work   I hate that!


[29-Nov-18 02:11 PM] chriscord#4741
You're good then. My guess is your git repo got in a bad state for some reason


[29-Nov-18 02:11 PM] chriscord#4741
Doesn't matter won't happen again


[29-Nov-18 02:11 PM] chriscord#4741
 


[29-Nov-18 02:11 PM] JW#2445
I used git fetch —all ; git checkout N.1.6.0.0 ;  instead of git fetch —all ; git checkout N.1.6.0.0 ; git reset —hard N.1.6.0.0


[29-Nov-18 02:12 PM] JW#2445
that did the trick on my part


[29-Nov-18 02:12 PM] chriscord#4741
Yes that would do it


[29-Nov-18 02:12 PM] chriscord#4741
I think you should have done `git checkout master`


[29-Nov-18 02:12 PM] JW#2445
Thnx mate!


[29-Nov-18 02:13 PM] chriscord#4741

You're welcome

My latency values have come down a bit, but I still see some higher than usual values. Is there anything I can do to reduce the latency values?


[29-Nov-18 02:35 PM] chriscord#4741
A couple more questions. What are the benefits of having a high number of peers? If so what can I do to increase that?


[29-Nov-18 02:36 PM] chriscord#4741
And what's the default value for max_miners? Is it 1 or ALL or something else?


[29-Nov-18 03:12 PM] Marcin#0065
i used one sign or one letter as prefix and the name app didnt reacto to it. how do i see if a wallet has been foound?

@chriscord What kind of latency values are you seeing?


[30-Nov-18 03:40 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You don't need to worry about the number of peers, you should be more concerned by your position in other people's peer lists (which you can only control by being faster to deliver data to others)


[30-Nov-18 03:40 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Nice @ATLAS !

Can I mine on my windows desktop?


[30-Nov-18 05:54 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Hey, sure you can. It's possible to set-up an Arweave mining environment on Windows using the
‘Windows Subsystem for Linux’ or a virtual machine environment. Do you have a copy of our mining guide or would you like me to send one over to you?


[30-Nov-18 05:57 AM] prk#3209
I don't have the mining guide


[30-Nov-18 05:57 AM] prk#3209
Would like to receive that


[30-Nov-18 05:58 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
No worries, if you DM me or send an email to team@arweave.org, I can send one over so you can get up and running 👾

Hey guys, anyone here using a vps for mining AR?


[30-Nov-18 06:57 AM] kryptofun#4977
Is the hardrive zize and type important for mining?


[30-Nov-18 07:16 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hey @kryptofun , yes, the size of the hard drive matters.

Regarding type: The speed of a normal HDD is sufficient for now -- SSDs do not offer much of an advantage, but please avoid tape drives  


[30-Nov-18 07:19 AM] kryptofun#4977
Thanks!


[30-Nov-18 08:30 AM] arweave-sam#9630
No worries at all


[30-Nov-18 10:23 AM] chriscord#4741
@arweave-sam I'm seeing latencies in 5 figures in some cases


[30-Nov-18 10:25 AM] chriscord#4741
I've tried tweaking max_miners and now it's typically 2 or 3 figures


[30-Nov-18 10:25 AM] chriscord#4741
Are there any other knobs I can play with, other than max_miners?


[30-Nov-18 11:31 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Interesting @chriscord


[30-Nov-18 11:31 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Are you seeing any other issues other than the latency?


[30-Nov-18 11:32 AM] arweave-sam#9630
If everything else is working fine, I wouldn't be concerned unless latency is over 100k.


[30-Nov-18 11:55 AM] chriscord#4741
I'm still monitoring and testing. Some periods of low CPU utilization but that might be normal. I'll let you know if I come across any other issues. Thanks!


[30-Nov-18 12:55 PM] arweave-sam#9630
No worries, let us know!


[30-Nov-18 12:55 PM] arweave-sam#9630
If you are still downloading blocks, periods without CPU usage are expected

how much reward comes from 1 block in arweave right now? its difficult to guess since its coming in over time, right?


[30-Nov-18 10:51 PM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
also does someone know for how much AR is traded at the new OTC desk currently?


[30-Nov-18 10:57 PM] ATLAS#7218
~7AR per block


[30-Nov-18 11:51 PM] prk#3209
Blocktime?


[01-Dec-18 12:48 AM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271

[01-Dec-18 12:51 AM] ATLAS#7218
2 minutes on avg


[01-Dec-18 12:52 AM] ATLAS#7218
~700 blocks per day.

Hi. What is the minimum hardware specs to start mining?


[01-Dec-18 01:54 AM] prk#3209
While running the miner for the first time we should enter the peers followed by mining address


[01-Dec-18 01:55 AM] prk#3209
Which address should I use?


[01-Dec-18 01:55 AM] prk#3209
Upvest one?


[01-Dec-18 02:51 AM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
@B4D_R you need a fast cpu and harddisk space. there is no real minimum but the more cores you got the better the results


[01-Dec-18 02:52 AM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
i mine on a 2012 xeon server cpu 1-3 blocks per day


[01-Dec-18 02:52 AM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
with 8 cores i think


[01-Dec-18 02:52 AM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
thats 10-20 AR


[01-Dec-18 02:54 AM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
ICO price was $0.80 when ETH was $800. with ETH down to $112 expect 1 AR = $0.11


[01-Dec-18 02:55 AM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
so 1 block can be expected to be worth somewhere around $0.50-$1 currently. that is $45-$90 on my machine per month.


[01-Dec-18 02:56 AM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
does someone has other estimates?


[01-Dec-18 02:57 AM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
actually my estimate is quite optimistic. that said, ico was badly oversubscribed but with primarily private rounds in

[01-Dec-18 04:13 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@Goldberg | StakeSquid One peer is enough and three makes it reasonably reliable in case the first peer disappears when/if your node restarts. This many peers is definitely overkill  


[01-Dec-18 05:04 AM] prk#3209
@arweave-martin so from the above list, only one peer is enough?


[01-Dec-18 05:29 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@prk The  `peer` argument is for specifying one or more peers you trust to bootstrap from. Basically, it's an entry-point to the network. Your node will find other nodes eventually.


[01-Dec-18 05:34 AM] prk#3209
@arweave-martinok got it
Is it possible to use a vps for mining?


[01-Dec-18 08:08 AM] prk#3209
Anybody here?


[01-Dec-18 08:08 AM] prk#3209
I followed the mining instructions.

[01-Dec-18 08:49 AM] tiamat#9131
@prk and after you start the miner what messages do you get?

@tiamat you mean after running the peers followed by wallet address?

I'm getting this error which others have had in the past. Just the one arweave server process running - confirmed with `netstat`:

It recovers ok from the crash though..


[01-Dec-18 02:37 PM] chriscord#4741
@prk it sounds like something's wrong with your install. Maybe you don't have permissions to access the logs directory?


[01-Dec-18 05:34 PM] Vilenarios#8742
@prk I use an Azure hosted server to mine AR.  Although with @Goldberg | StakeSquid estimates, its not profitable to mine in the cloud.


[01-Dec-18 05:35 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Although I hear that OTC deals are around 25 cents each.


[01-Dec-18 09:00 PM] prk#3209
@chriscord how to check that?


[01-Dec-18 09:00 PM] prk#3209
@Vilenarios which Azure plan are you using?


[01-Dec-18 10:01 PM] chriscord#4741
@prk https://askubuntu.com/a/43491


[01-Dec-18 10:03 PM] chriscord#4741
You may be better off reinstalling if you're still having problems starting your miner


[02-Dec-18 02:52 AM] Marcin#0065
For how long are the backed up rewards, from soft-onboarding time, payed out to new mined blocks?


[02-Dec-18 02:58 AM] ATLAS#7218
It sounds funny when you say backed up    


[02-Dec-18 02:58 AM] ATLAS#7218
It will start from block height 95000


[02-Dec-18 02:59 AM] ATLAS#7218
And its not 'backed up'. They simply want to stick with the first years emission of 5.5mil AR


[02-Dec-18 05:12 AM] Vilenarios#8742
@ATLAS did you ever get the total circulated supply?  Trying to figure out Arweave market cap.


[02-Dec-18 05:24 AM] Vilenarios#8742
@prk using F4s_v2 with a 64 GB standard HDD on their Ubuntu 18.0.4 image. It has 4 cpus but I do max_miners 3. Benchmark gives me around 150k hash per core. Approx 140 bucks a month.  Rock solid network performance.


[02-Dec-18 05:24 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I get a block or two a day from it.


[02-Dec-18 05:26 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Luckily I have an MSDN account so I get 150 bucks of free credit a month. You could certainly scale it up with higher core count but without a place to sell AR it’s just operating at a loss.


[02-Dec-18 05:47 AM] Marcin#0065
@ATLAS but how long will that phase go?


[02-Dec-18 06:26 AM] ATLAS#7218
@Vilenarios Nope. I can approximate a little and thats all.


[02-Dec-18 06:27 AM] ATLAS#7218
@Marcin Until the 1 year aniversary


[02-Dec-18 06:28 AM] ATLAS#7218
I think


[02-Dec-18 06:30 AM] Marcin#0065
But isnt it already rjnning longer than one year? I remember mining last year at that time already


[02-Dec-18 06:30 AM] ATLAS#7218
That was testnet


[02-Dec-18 06:30 AM] Marcin#0065
Ahh okay, it was testnet


[02-Dec-18 06:30 AM] Marcin#0065
Do you remember when the official net startet?


[02-Dec-18 06:30 AM] ATLAS#7218
In June 9 or smth


[02-Dec-18 06:30 AM] Marcin#0065
Oh okay :) thx


[02-Dec-18 06:34 AM] ATLAS#7218
55million AR was in genesis block. 38.5% was sold. So the sold tokens and mined ones will sum up to around 21million tokens


[02-Dec-18 06:34 AM] ATLAS#7218
But not so sure with the circulating supply


[02-Dec-18 06:35 AM] Marcin#0065
As far i remember 11mil were for mining?


[02-Dec-18 06:36 AM] ATLAS#7218
Yeah. 5.5mil for first year


[02-Dec-18 06:36 AM] ATLAS#7218
But the reward has been very low so far


[02-Dec-18 06:36 AM] ATLAS#7218
Around 220k AR was mined up until now


[02-Dec-18 06:37 AM] Marcin#0065
Really? So where do the 5.2 mil do come up for half a year? XD


[02-Dec-18 06:37 AM] ATLAS#7218
From block reward?


[02-Dec-18 06:37 AM] ATLAS#7218
wdym


[02-Dec-18 06:38 AM] Marcin#0065
Either the block time between blocks are lower, or the rewards must dramaticaly rise


[02-Dec-18 06:38 AM] ATLAS#7218
Rewards are increasing at block 95000


[02-Dec-18 06:40 AM] Marcin#0065
If the mining stays like that, we expect around 100k blocks toll june and 5.2mil AR?


[02-Dec-18 06:40 AM] ATLAS#7218
216000 blocks in first year


[02-Dec-18 06:40 AM] ATLAS#7218
I think


[02-Dec-18 06:41 AM] Marcin#0065
The reward will have mlre than x7 rewards?


[02-Dec-18 06:41 AM] ATLAS#7218
Yup


[02-Dec-18 06:41 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Oh snap


[02-Dec-18 06:41 AM] ATLAS#7218
Not exactly 7x


[02-Dec-18 06:41 AM] ATLAS#7218
I discussed it with sam above.


[02-Dec-18 06:41 AM] ATLAS#7218
I guess you missed it


[02-Dec-18 06:41 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I need to reread. I’ve been on vacation this past week.


[02-Dec-18 06:41 AM] ATLAS#7218
I think it was a bit smaller than 7x


[02-Dec-18 06:41 AM] Marcin#0065
Probably. Am on holiday xD i dot  follow much now


[02-Dec-18 06:41 AM] Marcin#0065
Doestn matter is little smaller. Still a huge bump


[02-Dec-18 06:41 AM] ATLAS#7218
I think it was few weeks ago


[02-Dec-18 06:42 AM] ATLAS#7218
Nov2 to be precise


[02-Dec-18 06:42 AM] ATLAS#7218
Wow. A month passed. Time sure flies


[02-Dec-18 06:43 AM] Marcin#0065
;) oh yes.


[02-Dec-18 06:45 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Hopefully arweave gets on Coinmarketcap at some point. I would like to think the team would work on that when ready. @arweave-india


[02-Dec-18 07:13 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Calling all miners! It's time to upgrade your miners before new features from N.1.6.0.0 are activated. 70% of the network has already upgraded and you know what they say — if you snooze, you lose ⛏️


[02-Dec-18 07:27 AM] arweave-sam#9630
According to @tiamat 's new network monitoring tool, it is now 83.7% of the network that is on 1.6  


[02-Dec-18 07:28 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Everyone upgrading has also greatly improved the performance of the network, too


[02-Dec-18 07:29 AM] Vilenarios#8742
New ugprade was smooth as always


[02-Dec-18 07:29 AM] arweave-sam#9630
'Consensus time' (the time between the first 'accepted_foreign_block' and the last, across our non-mining nodes) is down ~60%.


[02-Dec-18 07:31 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@Vilenarios Thanks, but let's wait until 96000 or so before we celebrate  


[02-Dec-18 07:33 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Ah OK, thanks for clarifying @arweave-sam  


[02-Dec-18 07:39 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Just to confirm - arweave.N.1","version":5,"release":19 is the latest version right?


[02-Dec-18 07:40 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep!


[02-Dec-18 07:40 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You are set  


[02-Dec-18 08:34 AM] prk#3209
Anyone here?
Have one doubt


[02-Dec-18 08:40 AM] tiamat#9131
only one? lucky you

[02-Dec-18 08:47 AM] prk#3209
The peers command is not working


[02-Dec-18 08:48 AM] ATLAS#7218
Try with only one working peer


[02-Dec-18 08:49 AM] ATLAS#7218
54.93.54.173


[02-Dec-18 08:49 AM] ATLAS#7218
This shall work fine


[02-Dec-18 08:49 AM] prk#3209
Shouldn't I add ./Arweave-server\ before the peers?


[02-Dec-18 08:49 AM] ATLAS#7218
yeah


[02-Dec-18 08:50 AM] ATLAS#7218
./arweave-server peer 54.93.54.173 mine mining_addr xxx


[02-Dec-18 08:51 AM] ATLAS#7218
if you dont set maxminers or polling mode, this is the command


[02-Dec-18 08:53 AM] tiamat#9131
I remember there was a javascript tool to generate cmd line

[02-Dec-18 09:03 AM] prk#3209
I only used 1 peer, will it cause any problem?


[02-Dec-18 09:03 AM] tiamat#9131
only if that peer goes down and you restart the miner


[02-Dec-18 09:03 AM] tiamat#9131
it gets more peers


[02-Dec-18 09:03 AM] tiamat#9131
even if starts with 1


[02-Dec-18 09:04 AM] prk#3209
Is it possible to add more peers?


[02-Dec-18 09:04 AM] prk#3209
Ok


[02-Dec-18 09:06 AM] Marcin#0065

Make all

Should help too, if u have make errors


[02-Dec-18 09:08 AM] prk#3209
The main terminal is showing "Joined the Arweave Network successfully"


[02-Dec-18 09:09 AM] prk#3209
But when I ran make log, it's showing info report: could not start mining


[02-Dec-18 09:13 AM] tiamat#9131
you need to wait a while until it gets the recall blocks needed


[02-Dec-18 09:13 AM] tiamat#9131
you are ok for now


[02-Dec-18 09:13 AM] tiamat#9131
just make sure it remains running after you disconnect from the console (did you use screen or nohup?)


[02-Dec-18 09:14 AM] prk#3209
Screen


[02-Dec-18 09:26 AM] prk#3209

[02-Dec-18 09:43 AM] prk#3209
Stored recall block for foreign verification


[02-Dec-18 09:43 AM] Vilenarios#8742
That’s okay


[02-Dec-18 09:44 AM] Vilenarios#8742
That’s not an error


[02-Dec-18 09:44 AM] Vilenarios#8742
In order to begin mining for a new block, you need the recall block.


[02-Dec-18 09:44 AM] Vilenarios#8742
If you don’t have that, your node will just download the blockchain


[02-Dec-18 09:44 AM] Vilenarios#8742
You should be able to go to http://yournodeip:1984/info


[02-Dec-18 09:44 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Does that work for you?


[02-Dec-18 10:21 AM] iBatman#2943
Hello everyone, started mining arweave today! This is my first ever experience of mining   Can anyone please clarify why I am to download all the current blocks before i start mining? The whitepaper said miners won’t have to download the complete weave to start mining. Also what is the current size of the block weave at it’s current height of 94170?


[02-Dec-18 11:09 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Because in order to mine the latest block you need the “recall block”. I think this is all described in the white paper. However you still don’t need the full chain to mine, it just helps your chances. For example if you have 50%blocks then you have 50% chance to mine.


[02-Dec-18 11:10 AM] Vilenarios#8742
https://viewblock.io/arweave has around 550MB stored.


[02-Dec-18 11:12 AM] Vilenarios#8742
A year from now idk how it will be possible for new miners to get the full chain. That’s where storage pools have to come in to play.


[02-Dec-18 03:18 PM] RaziWu#1003
Anyone has a link for the mining instructions? Tnx


[03-Dec-18 02:54 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Hey @RaziWu, I sent one over last night to your inbox. Let me know if you've any questions 🤖


[03-Dec-18 03:27 AM] RaziWu#1003
@arweave-sophie yep, got it thanks. Syncing is taking much longer than I expected. After 8 hours I only got 8700 blocks. Port 1984 is open. Is this normal? It’ll take days to fully sync


[03-Dec-18 03:54 AM] Marcin#0065
Be happy it not taking a months like in the beginning ;)


[03-Dec-18 03:54 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
This sounds about right for 8 hours. Just to clarify, only 50 blocks are needed in order to start mining, however the more blocks you store, the higher the chance you have at storing the recall block. Storing the recall block will then allow you to start hashing, as explained by @Vilenarios above  


[03-Dec-18 04:25 AM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
@arweave-martin yeah but this way i don't have to watch out which one is still working eh? does it hurt to have that many?


[03-Dec-18 04:26 AM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
@Vilenarios thanks for the update on AR prices


[03-Dec-18 04:26 AM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
@B4D_R i don't have windows but i guess there is at least a docker container available that should run as cake


[03-Dec-18 05:06 AM] tiamat#9131
@Goldberg | StakeSquid I guess it can hurt when restarting if many are down you need to wait for timeouts(not sure if it uses parallel sockets yet?)


[03-Dec-18 05:30 AM] Marcin#0065
somehow after reconnecting to the network i get many peers, over 100. but it slightly decreases to exactly 33 peers. is that on purpose?


[03-Dec-18 05:31 AM] Marcin#0065
usually i dont have that weird problem


[03-Dec-18 07:40 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Also @Goldberg | StakeSquid the block rewards are increasing a whole lot after 95000 from what I understand. Further incentivizes miners, but also puts a lot more selling pressure...


[03-Dec-18 07:42 AM] Vilenarios#8742
If all goes well with arweave we should expect a TON of new miners because it will easily be the most profitable coin to mine.


[03-Dec-18 07:43 AM] Marcin#0065
for the first time i see something liek that in the log:

=INFO REPORT==== 3-Dec-2018::14:37:36 ===

A few other smaller things too


[03-Dec-18 03:12 PM] arweave-sam#9630
There is some setup required for (for example) the BHL merkle roots, so it has to happen across a couple of blocks


[03-Dec-18 03:12 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Glad it is working well for you, @Marcin !


[03-Dec-18 03:13 PM] Marcin#0065
since the last update, i was able to bump my miner 2 more threads and still keep up in sync


[03-Dec-18 03:13 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Neat!


[03-Dec-18 03:13 PM] arweave-sam#9630
How many miners rel to threads?


[03-Dec-18 03:14 PM] arweave-sam#9630
9 to go, difficulty dropped by one. Shouldn't take long...


[03-Dec-18 03:14 PM] Marcin#0065
at my machine its 20/24 now, regarding i run an another, similar project in the background too xD


[03-Dec-18 03:14 PM] Marcin#0065
but it had to be connected only, it barely takes any resources


[03-Dec-18 03:14 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Thats where ubtuntu beats the piss out of wsl


[03-Dec-18 03:14 PM] Vilenarios#8742
ubuntu i can do -4 threads no problem, wsl i need like -6 or more


[03-Dec-18 03:15 PM] Vilenarios#8742
or else its just 100% cpu all the time


[03-Dec-18 03:15 PM] Marcin#0065
my cpu are between 80-100 all time


[03-Dec-18 03:15 PM] Marcin#0065
i try to avoid a lagging system


[03-Dec-18 03:16 PM] Marcin#0065
i got some spare xeon around, maybe i try them out soon too


[03-Dec-18 03:16 PM] Marcin#0065
intel beats the hash rates dramatically compared to the amd contrahent, dunno why.


[03-Dec-18 03:17 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I would like to know why


[03-Dec-18 03:18 PM] Vilenarios#8742
yeah my intels own the amds, even on wsl


[03-Dec-18 03:18 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I remember somebody tried an ARM processor a while ago -- did they ever post performance stats?


[03-Dec-18 03:18 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I dont have ARM proc in my collected performance stats


[03-Dec-18 03:20 PM] Marcin#0065
ill wait till google starts mining all tokens away xD   then my machine goes for sell  


[03-Dec-18 03:20 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Haha


[03-Dec-18 03:20 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Would you mind sharing your stats @Vilenarios ?


[03-Dec-18 03:24 PM] Marcin#0065
-10 nodes in 5 minutes?


[03-Dec-18 03:25 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Are you looking on VB?


[03-Dec-18 03:25 PM] Marcin#0065
ye


[03-Dec-18 03:25 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It was also +20 nodes a few minutes a go

Thanks @Vilenarios that's really cool info


[03-Dec-18 03:30 PM] Vilenarios#8742
i think the cost per MH is misleading though - as cheap MH doesnt exactly equate to more blocks found


[03-Dec-18 03:31 PM] Marcin#0065
miner is running smoothly

So mining rewards are up to what now per block/


[03-Dec-18 03:36 PM] arweave-sam#9630
~37 AR/block

what about that visualisation of the network, any progress? u had a prewview once

I am going to run that again in some time and will let you guys know if I run into any challenges

It is a bit late EU time, so the team might not be around too much later, but we always pick up unsolved issues in the morning  


[03-Dec-18 03:40 PM] arweave-india#5075
Yeah @ThanosAlpha - do you have the mining guide from us already? If not, DM me your email address and we'll get it sent over. If you have the guide already please do let us know any feedback you have if you feel we need to be more explicit or clearer anywhere  


[03-Dec-18 03:40 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Good question @Marcin

Annnnd difficulty has adjusted again


[03-Dec-18 03:45 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Which pretty much covers the core range of motion of the network  


[03-Dec-18 03:45 PM] Marcin#0065
at 34 its out of my league  


[03-Dec-18 03:46 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yeah, it has been slowly tending upwards


[04-Dec-18 02:25 AM] awkweird#6550
Do we have to restart our machines? Cuz i haven’t seem to find a single block after the block 95000


[04-Dec-18 02:55 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hey @awkweird


[04-Dec-18 02:56 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Have you checked your version is up to date?


[04-Dec-18 02:56 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The rest of the network has moved on ~330 blocks now


[04-Dec-18 03:14 AM] awkweird#6550
Yes, i have updated the algo


[04-Dec-18 03:15 AM] awkweird#6550
Wondering how many active miners atm


[04-Dec-18 03:25 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Around the number on VB, I think


[04-Dec-18 03:26 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Interesting that your miner didn't progress past 95000


[04-Dec-18 03:26 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Are you running in normal or polling mode?


[04-Dec-18 04:04 AM] awkweird#6550
Its normal mode


[04-Dec-18 04:04 AM] awkweird#6550
I have only one machine working


[04-Dec-18 04:05 AM] awkweird#6550
Oh, didn’t know VB has such data available


[04-Dec-18 06:01 AM] Vilenarios#8742
ive been finding blocks just fine - prolly mined more AR last night than i did all last week  


[04-Dec-18 06:02 AM] tierralibre#2740
I just posted some transactions. One of them has an x and is not archived. Can a transaction fail to archive? Or is just time?


[04-Dec-18 06:02 AM] tierralibre#2740
is not on the block viewer either

[04-Dec-18 06:03 AM] Marcin#0065
Since blockheigh 95000 i havent mined a single block, which is weird. Usually there should be some :/


[04-Dec-18 06:04 AM] tierralibre#2740
I have not been mined a single block for afew days neither


[04-Dec-18 06:05 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
It's unusual, but it is possible for a transaction to fail @tierralibre. I will ask @arweave-kyle to investigate the transaction ID, however i'd recommend trying to archive it again and it should be accepted.


[04-Dec-18 06:05 AM] tierralibre#2740
And I am actually achiving things. Is there a way to connect the wallet to my node


[04-Dec-18 06:05 AM] tierralibre#2740
and if it fails there is no cost of AR?


[04-Dec-18 06:06 AM] tierralibre#2740
it does have a status failed


[04-Dec-18 06:06 AM] tierralibre#2740
ime
2018-12-04 12:40:23 +01:00 
Status
Failed


[04-Dec-18 06:09 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @tierralibre , no worries there is no cost if your transaction fails. The wallet temporarily lowers your balance while it's pending, but as soon as it's seen to have failed your balance will revert back as nothing has actually happened


[04-Dec-18 06:09 AM] tierralibre#2740
thank you!


[04-Dec-18 06:10 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
You can point the wallet to your own node if you'd like, if you go to settings you can turn on the 'Use Custom Node' option and then enter a custom IP address  


[04-Dec-18 06:10 AM] tierralibre#2740
fantastic!


[04-Dec-18 06:10 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
I wouldn't do this while you've got any pending transactions as it might get a bit confused!


[04-Dec-18 06:11 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Otherwise you'll be fine


[04-Dec-18 06:12 AM] tierralibre#2740
I guess url ok too no instead of ip?


[04-Dec-18 06:13 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Currently it's IP only, this will change in future though


[04-Dec-18 06:45 AM] Vilenarios#8742
@Embiei|MassStake if you have at least a 4-core CPU, then you would be able to mine AR currently.  That may change as difficulty is slowly increasing.  Yes there are some miners which are getting more rewards than others, but its not centralized IMO.  You can go to https://viewblock.io/arweave/blocks to see who is mining what.  109 nodes online at the moment with a 35 difficulty.


[04-Dec-18 06:49 AM] Marcin#0065
We need like 20 intel cpu pushed to 5ghz to stay competetive xD


[04-Dec-18 07:06 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I’d love to sel my gpu miner and get a intel 7980xe  


[04-Dec-18 07:15 AM] Embiei|MassStake#8665
@Marcin That is what i was afraid xD


[04-Dec-18 07:17 AM] Embiei|MassStake#8665
@Vilenarios Ty for the explanation. I had a GPU rig which i sold long time ago. Now i just have my personal computer, which is nice, but not at competitive level


[04-Dec-18 07:18 AM] Embiei|MassStake#8665
maybe i will give a try for 24 hours


[04-Dec-18 07:18 AM] Embiei|MassStake#8665
and see if i manage to get any block (but my guess is not)


[04-Dec-18 07:48 AM] Vilenarios#8742
definitely wont get any blocks for first 24 hours


[04-Dec-18 07:49 AM] Vilenarios#8742
your chances of mining improve as you download the full blockweave


[04-Dec-18 08:37 AM] Embiei|MassStake#8665
oh


[04-Dec-18 08:38 AM] Embiei|MassStake#8665
this is a different concept right


[04-Dec-18 09:43 AM] Marcin#0065
No block in 24 hours at my machine? What did that update to my machine    


[04-Dec-18 09:46 AM] Marcin#0065
I guess the big player will be dominating the mining rewards in the very near future, if the difficulty rises more. Why should an indivial even try to join and mine? Some kind of "official" mining pool planned?


[04-Dec-18 09:54 AM] arweave-sam#9630
No official mining pool planned at the moment, that should be a community led thing  


[04-Dec-18 10:22 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Marcin didn’t you recently increase max_miners? Maybe lower it a bit and see if there is a correlation.


[04-Dec-18 10:22 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Your IP didn’t change either right? Losing wildfire ranking could also screw up rewards.


[04-Dec-18 10:24 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@Marcin Looks like you caught a block a few minutes ago  


[04-Dec-18 10:27 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Has anyone figured out how to get custom miner address yet?


[04-Dec-18 10:29 AM] arweave-sam#9630
`app_namer:start("Vilenarios", 20, l33t).`


[04-Dec-18 10:29 AM] arweave-sam#9630
But you want to search for many fewer characters than that  


[04-Dec-18 10:29 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Haha cool!


[04-Dec-18 10:33 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You can also provide a list for the first argument like this:

`app_namer:start(["name1", "name2", "name3"], 20, l33t).`

So that you increase the chance that you find a name that you are interested in


[04-Dec-18 10:51 AM] Vilenarios#8742
fantastic - maybe ill do this for each one of my miners to more easily keep track


[04-Dec-18 10:54 AM] Vilenarios#8742
so i run that in the erlang console? aka i just run /arweave-server without anything else?


[04-Dec-18 11:17 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep!


[04-Dec-18 11:18 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Just on the Arweave shell


[04-Dec-18 11:20 AM] tiamat#9131
who won the contest?


[04-Dec-18 11:21 AM] tiamat#9131
I remember a contest for block 65700 and one for best address before 95000, who won them?


[04-Dec-18 11:21 AM] tiamat#9131
and what were the rewards


[04-Dec-18 11:36 AM] Marcin#0065
@arweave-sam yeah :) i still believe in wonders :D


[04-Dec-18 12:08 PM] Marcin#0065
Question from the technical point of view: does polling mode allow to run several machines parallel onto one IP connection?


[04-Dec-18 12:14 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Yes marcin - i have 4 machines behind 1 ip address, 3 are using polling and they have all found blocks.


[04-Dec-18 12:15 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Sam estimated at least 6% loss of efficiency with polling.


[04-Dec-18 12:15 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Would love to switch to multi-port...


[04-Dec-18 12:17 PM] Marcin#0065
Okay cool :) ill try to fire my old servers and see if its working. 
Intel xeon from 2008 xD 2x4 cores on one mainboard. The good old shit back then :D im curious if they start burning my house down


[04-Dec-18 12:19 PM] Vilenarios#8742

Alright. Probably raspberry pi level ;)


[04-Dec-18 12:24 PM] Vilenarios#8742
@arweave-sam Will the app_namer spit out the wallet address and stop when done?  Or do i have to search a log or something?


[04-Dec-18 12:52 PM] Marcin#0065
It creates random wallets and then deletes all, which do not have ur given prefixes.
At least i think so. I could also observe that procedure in nautilus


[04-Dec-18 12:53 PM] Vilenarios#8742
hmm okay... i guess ill just let it do its thing for a while.  dunno if i want to put all my cores to vanity wallet names


[04-Dec-18 01:27 PM] Marcin#0065

[04-Dec-18 01:53 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I dont


[04-Dec-18 01:54 PM] Vilenarios#8742
port forwarding is only to 1 machine


[04-Dec-18 01:54 PM] Vilenarios#8742
ive yet to look into load balancing, which would let me port forward to multiple machines


[04-Dec-18 02:02 PM] Marcin#0065
Oh interesting. Without port forwarding i dont get any peers


[04-Dec-18 02:02 PM] Vilenarios#8742
really?


[04-Dec-18 02:02 PM] Vilenarios#8742
you are using polling right?


[04-Dec-18 02:02 PM] Marcin#0065
I kinda need that port open, but forwarding goes, as u said, to one machine only :D


[04-Dec-18 02:02 PM] Marcin#0065
Yes, polling is true


[04-Dec-18 02:03 PM] Vilenarios#8742
i get peers with my polling machines


[04-Dec-18 02:03 PM] Marcin#0065
I just have one peer, that peer i did use for the mining command


[04-Dec-18 02:04 PM] Vilenarios#8742
that was happening to me when i used the port command and tried changing the port to non-1984


[04-Dec-18 02:05 PM] Vilenarios#8742
for my polling machines, i peer with other external nodes as well as the internal IP of my one node that has port forwarding


[04-Dec-18 02:07 PM] Marcin#0065
Ahh yes, that could work. I could peer up to my main machine then.


[04-Dec-18 02:08 PM] Vilenarios#8742
also of course make sure any local firewalls are open on port 1984 as well


[04-Dec-18 02:08 PM] Marcin#0065
Okay, after some waiting, there have been more peers now :D sorry for the confusion


[04-Dec-18 02:09 PM] Marcin#0065
Yes firewall is open


[04-Dec-18 02:09 PM] Vilenarios#8742
polling used to suck, but lately since recent updates my polling machines are always at block height


[04-Dec-18 02:10 PM] Marcin#0065
Mine polling it on height too


[04-Dec-18 02:10 PM] Marcin#0065
Seems wor work now. Jezz my room is going to heat up the whole house xD


[04-Dec-18 02:55 PM] Vilenarios#8742
just did a size check...


[04-Dec-18 02:55 PM] Vilenarios#8742
blocks/txs/wallet_lists up to 201,000 files and approx 29GB


[04-Dec-18 02:55 PM] Vilenarios#8742
compressed is about 12.5GB

Ahh ye, for your stats: its a 4 core cpu


[04-Dec-18 04:11 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Oh so ur running dual cpu. So that’s not too bad I don’t think. You may get a block every day or two


[04-Dec-18 09:17 PM] aurora#3501
and what is the block reward approx?


[04-Dec-18 11:48 PM] awkweird#6550
32Ar per block


[05-Dec-18 06:33 PM] awkweird#6550
What is the current difficulty now? Seems like my machine is not able to perform as it was a month ago


[05-Dec-18 06:58 PM] ATLAS#7218
viewblock has difficulty on it

[05-Dec-18 07:00 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Node count been around 110-120


[05-Dec-18 08:12 PM] ivhturp#3325
is it 32 AR per block or 7 AR per block ?


[05-Dec-18 08:13 PM] ivhturp#3325
@Vilenarios @Marcin How does polling mode work? Does it mine as well or simply syncs the blocks?


[06-Dec-18 12:56 AM] Marcin#0065
I cant tell you how it works from the technical point of view.
But we use polling, if u have not got a static ip adress, or you have more machines over one ip adress


[06-Dec-18 01:16 AM] ivhturp#3325
Oh great. Will it still be able to push candidate blocks over the network ?


[06-Dec-18 07:29 AM] nett8#3527
Will it work on Ubuntu 16.04?


[06-Dec-18 07:35 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yes @ivhturp , you will be able to push candidate blocks, but other nodes won't be able to send to you, so you will have to repeatedly 'poll' another node to check the current block


[06-Dec-18 07:35 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Rendering your miner ~6% less efficient


[06-Dec-18 07:36 AM] ivhturp#3325
Ah thats great to hear @arweave-sam


[06-Dec-18 07:36 AM] ivhturp#3325
That will be very useful


[06-Dec-18 07:36 AM] ivhturp#3325
@nett8 yes its working perfectly fine on 16.04


[06-Dec-18 08:16 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I’ve noticed my polling nodes are less successful getting a mined block accepted by the network. My non polling nodes always seem to have network acceptance of every mined block.


[06-Dec-18 08:21 AM] tierralibre#2740
is the block explorer not updated?


[06-Dec-18 08:21 AM] tierralibre#2740
or the transactions tab only shows monetary transaction?


[06-Dec-18 08:22 AM] tierralibre#2740
I don't see this transaction on the viewer

I'm seeing the "no foreign block " error on miners that were previously running without problems


[10-Dec-18 12:07 AM] chriscord#4741
On one of my miners, all I did was restart arweave before the errors started. Was running fine before that


[10-Dec-18 12:07 AM] chriscord#4741
So I don't think it's a hardware or configuration problem


[10-Dec-18 12:09 AM] chriscord#4741
In all cases, they start with a block height of around 95080 but increment slowly, maybe once every 10 minutes or so


[10-Dec-18 12:10 AM] chriscord#4741
I also don't think it's a network problem


[10-Dec-18 12:10 AM] chriscord#4741
@arweave-sam any ideas?


[10-Dec-18 12:34 AM] ATLAS#7218
Try with max_miners 1 to see if your lag persists


[10-Dec-18 12:34 AM] ivhturp#3325
@chriscord do u see any errors in log files ?


[10-Dec-18 12:35 AM] ATLAS#7218
If it doesn't, the issue is with cpu overloading and try setting your max_miners to at least 2 lower than your number of vcpu


[10-Dec-18 12:36 AM] ATLAS#7218
Do you do anything else with while mining?


[10-Dec-18 01:39 AM] chriscord#4741
Thanks @ATLAS I don’t see anything when I tail the log file. I’ll take a closer look at the log file later


[10-Dec-18 01:40 AM] chriscord#4741
No, only running the Arweave miner in a tmux session


[10-Dec-18 01:40 AM] ATLAS#7218
Try with max_miners 1 to see if your lag persists


[10-Dec-18 01:41 AM] chriscord#4741
I’ve tried tweaking max_miners, same issue


[10-Dec-18 01:42 AM] chriscord#4741
But I haven’t tried with it set to 1


[10-Dec-18 01:42 AM] ATLAS#7218
How fast is your internet


[10-Dec-18 01:42 AM] chriscord#4741
I’ll try that


[10-Dec-18 01:42 AM] ATLAS#7218
If you don't have much blocks, downloading all the blocks might be stressing your internet speed.


[10-Dec-18 01:43 AM] chriscord#4741
No I had all blocks before it started


[10-Dec-18 01:43 AM] chriscord#4741
Haven’t tested my speed yet


[10-Dec-18 01:43 AM] ATLAS#7218
Ok internet is not an issue probably. How much RAM you have


[10-Dec-18 01:43 AM] ATLAS#7218
Minimum of 8gb is recommended


[10-Dec-18 01:43 AM] chriscord#4741
Plenty 32


[10-Dec-18 01:44 AM] ATLAS#7218
Hmm weird. Probably with cpu then.


[10-Dec-18 01:44 AM] chriscord#4741
What do you recommend for Internet speed test?


[10-Dec-18 01:44 AM] ATLAS#7218
If you have all the blocks, it shouldn't be an issue even if its 10Mbps


[10-Dec-18 01:46 AM] ATLAS#7218
Since the blocks are not that big nowadays, 1MB per second would not be a bottleneck I think


[10-Dec-18 01:46 AM] chriscord#4741
Yes it’s strange. And always at block height around 95080


[10-Dec-18 01:47 AM] chriscord#4741
I’ll play around with max_miners as you suggest and check back later


[10-Dec-18 01:47 AM] chriscord#4741
Thanks!


[10-Dec-18 04:27 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hey @chriscord


[10-Dec-18 04:28 AM] arweave-sam#9630
That message means that (for whatever reason) you have not been sent a valid block by a member of the rest of the network for an unusually long period


[10-Dec-18 04:28 AM] arweave-sam#9630
There was a very slow block some time over the last few days (longer than an hour), so that could have been the cause of the issue


[10-Dec-18 04:30 AM] arweave-sam#9630
> yeah, team should come up with some bugs to make us active again

@tiamat You are asking for bugs for Christmas?  


[10-Dec-18 04:34 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Regarding the naming competition for the 1.6 fork:

We have looked through all of the addresses that generated blocks in the appropriate period and found that `CHe3rs_aRw3av3_FymA0qKuPiecx1yugFEzm1n5nKAQ` is the best (in our opinion). A 14 character address is pretty impressive! 250 AR coming your way :).


[10-Dec-18 04:38 AM] arweave-sam#9630
`How_about_a_burning_address_zzzzZZZZZZzzzzw` also mined a block  


[10-Dec-18 06:39 AM] ATLAS#7218
Are you serious about the second one?


[10-Dec-18 06:40 AM] ATLAS#7218
Ah


[10-Dec-18 06:40 AM] ATLAS#7218
He just set that as a mining address


[10-Dec-18 06:40 AM] ATLAS#7218
For fun


[10-Dec-18 06:40 AM] ATLAS#7218
Nice one hahahah


[10-Dec-18 06:41 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I wonder if the person who found a 14 character address would have made more AR mining during that time.


[10-Dec-18 06:41 AM] ATLAS#7218
Its not only about money  


[10-Dec-18 06:42 AM] ATLAS#7218
Its like buying a nice wallet


[10-Dec-18 06:42 AM] ATLAS#7218
Or sending a nice message to support AR


[10-Dec-18 06:42 AM] ATLAS#7218
Anyways, glad he found the address he wanted.


[10-Dec-18 06:43 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Ya that’s pretty awesome.


[10-Dec-18 07:30 AM] Marcin#0065
2 days without a block mined. Probably reaching slowly a point, where i get rid of my miner soon :/ do you experience similar decresing mined blocks?


[10-Dec-18 07:44 AM] ATLAS#7218
Mine is increasing :3


[10-Dec-18 07:44 AM] ATLAS#7218

Yeah that happens to me too - more so on Windows Subsytem for Linux.


[10-Dec-18 08:09 AM] Vilenarios#8742
A hard reboot fixes the issue. It relates to ephemeral port exhaustion.  At least in my case. Idk how to fix.

So how does the soft onboarding miner rewards get distributed?  Am I just going to get a random tx one day with some AR?


[10-Dec-18 12:58 PM] ATLAS#7218
They are distributing using the increased reward


[10-Dec-18 12:59 PM] ATLAS#7218
That was the only reason for 5x-ing the reward


[10-Dec-18 12:59 PM] Vilenarios#8742
ohhh


[10-Dec-18 12:59 PM] Vilenarios#8742

[10-Dec-18 01:00 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Baz what kind of miners are you putting up?


[10-Dec-18 01:02 PM] ATLAS#7218
Intel Haswell with 8vcpu. bunch of them


[10-Dec-18 01:04 PM] Vilenarios#8742
cloud hosted?


[10-Dec-18 01:04 PM] ATLAS#7218
nope


[10-Dec-18 01:12 PM] ATLAS#7218
I tried with AWS. But they kept going down because of constant high cpu usage. I had to drop the max_miners a lot to make it consistent. Maybe I was just unlucky.


[10-Dec-18 01:12 PM] Vilenarios#8742
weird, i dont have that problem with Azure


[10-Dec-18 01:13 PM] Vilenarios#8742
it just costs a lot  


[10-Dec-18 01:13 PM] Vilenarios#8742
can use 3 out of 4 cpus on a 4vcpu box


[10-Dec-18 01:13 PM] ATLAS#7218
Azure is for windows machines primarily. So yeah, bet theyre expensive af.


[10-Dec-18 01:17 PM] Vilenarios#8742
They got a nice ubuntu 18.0.4 image on there, works good for a linux noob like me

Before this, when it's trying to join the network it is -1


[10-Dec-18 02:59 PM] Vilenarios#8742
i had the error occur simultaneously on 2 of my polling nodes today, but not on my regular node.  internet access was seemingly fine all day.


[10-Dec-18 03:00 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Hey @chriscord , which nodes are you joining on?


[10-Dec-18 03:01 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We left a couple of nodes unupgraded so that we can check the progress of the nodes that didn't update to version 1.6 on time.


[10-Dec-18 03:01 PM] chriscord#4741
```
./arweave-server peer 52.56.119.91 peer 34.216.88.202 peer 54.93.54.173 peer 18.130.126.49 peer 13.231.142.3 peer 18.179.119.203 peer 54.159.24.25 peer 54.175.114.204
```


[10-Dec-18 03:01 PM] arweave-sam#9630
IIRC they stopped 88 blocks past the 1.6 fork height


[10-Dec-18 03:02 PM] chriscord#4741
Interesting, you think that's the problem


[10-Dec-18 03:02 PM] chriscord#4741
Connecting to the wrong peers at the start?


[10-Dec-18 03:03 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Please can you try joining on 206.189.5.91 ?


[10-Dec-18 03:03 PM] chriscord#4741
Sure. Only 206.189.5.91?


[10-Dec-18 03:03 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep


[10-Dec-18 03:06 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Please can you tell me the reported block height after join?


[10-Dec-18 03:06 PM] chriscord#4741
Yes! `"height":99264`


[10-Dec-18 03:07 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Welcome back to the mainnet  


[10-Dec-18 03:07 PM] arweave-sam#9630
That should fix it


[10-Dec-18 03:07 PM] chriscord#4741
Thanks  


[10-Dec-18 03:07 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Happy to help :)


[10-Dec-18 03:08 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Let us know if the issue continues


[10-Dec-18 03:08 PM] chriscord#4741
 🏽 sure will do


[10-Dec-18 03:12 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Only 750 blocks to 100k!


[11-Dec-18 01:43 AM] Marcin#0065
3rd day without a block mined :S either something is wrong, or it a point to take it off the network. 
Way sooner than expected


[11-Dec-18 04:25 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Hey Marcin - something may be wrong. I’m still finding blocks on all my miners even the 2 cpu ones.


[11-Dec-18 04:25 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Maybe scale down max_miners? Idk


[11-Dec-18 04:32 AM] Marcin#0065
I havent changed anything, im still super synched. Probably just too many miners?


[11-Dec-18 04:50 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Eh only 120 nodes and difficulty has been like 32-34 most times. Sometimes 35.


[11-Dec-18 04:51 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I feel like you should still be finding some.. very weird.


[11-Dec-18 04:54 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Are you even finding blocks and just not getting them accepted by the network?


[11-Dec-18 05:45 AM] Marcin#0065
Usually it worked fine on that kind of level. I know there might be 1 or 2 unlucky days. But its already 3 and the 4th running. Either im suuuuuuper unlucky, or there is some kind of bug


[11-Dec-18 05:46 AM] Marcin#0065
Im not calculating any blocks any more. Networkwise it looks okay


[11-Dec-18 05:50 AM] Marcin#0065
I guess it just some network delay, since the peers have dropped lately. And the blocks arrive way later than the actual time stamp on viewblock. Its like running behind all time i guess.


[11-Dec-18 05:50 AM] tiamat#9131
are you polling?


[11-Dec-18 06:18 AM] awkweird#6550
Marcin, i also had same issue last couple of days. Seems like there are many more miners than before the block 95k.


[11-Dec-18 06:18 AM] awkweird#6550
But luckily i start to find some blocks again from yesterday


[11-Dec-18 06:19 AM] Marcin#0065
Im not polling


[11-Dec-18 06:19 AM] Marcin#0065
I was mining smooth the last weeks, no problems at all. Since i realised all is fine, except the block calculation missing. 
Ive been through all bug during the last months, i just believe im super unlucky


[11-Dec-18 06:19 AM] awkweird#6550
This is why i want to see the mining status of my machine, how much has been mined in what particular time


[11-Dec-18 06:20 AM] Vilenarios#8742
that would be very nice - its hard to look through the logs


[11-Dec-18 06:20 AM] awkweird#6550
What i am doing is writing down manually


[11-Dec-18 06:20 AM] awkweird#6550
Lol


[11-Dec-18 06:21 AM] Marcin#0065
I had days like 23 hours no block, and then few block in 1 hour xD
Its really weird


[11-Dec-18 06:21 AM] Vilenarios#8742
that happened to me too for a day and a half or so


[11-Dec-18 06:21 AM] Vilenarios#8742
so maybe there was something weird with a block that was messing us up


[11-Dec-18 06:21 AM] Marcin#0065
I dont know. But it would be indeed neat to have more statistics for mining


[11-Dec-18 06:22 AM] Marcin#0065
Maybe not more, but better visualised. Maybe some kind of blanko database layout you can import you logfiles and see through all with graphs and so on


[11-Dec-18 06:23 AM] awkweird#6550
That would help


[11-Dec-18 06:23 AM] Marcin#0065
The information is existenty but its hard to see thru


[11-Dec-18 06:24 AM] awkweird#6550
Also the time on mining terminal time doesn’t match with the pc time, which is very odd


[11-Dec-18 06:25 AM] Marcin#0065
There must be one timestamp for all


[11-Dec-18 06:25 AM] Marcin#0065
So that point is fine


[11-Dec-18 06:26 AM] Marcin#0065
The time on the logs are correct i think


[11-Dec-18 06:27 AM] awkweird#6550
Yes indeed,


[11-Dec-18 06:28 AM] awkweird#6550
Nonetheless i only find 1 single block in 25-30 hours with 6 core


[11-Dec-18 06:52 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I’ve been meaning to get some reports in powerBI just never enough time in the day.


[11-Dec-18 06:52 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I’d like to see node growth over time, as well as how many wallets are actually receiving coins from new blocks.


[11-Dec-18 07:07 AM] tierralibre#2740
how one can mine cool addreses?


[11-Dec-18 07:07 AM] tierralibre#2740
I  did not understand that part


[11-Dec-18 07:07 AM] tierralibre#2740
is there software provided


[11-Dec-18 07:16 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Sam posted instructions above on how to try to generate a custom wallet address.


[11-Dec-18 07:56 AM] tierralibre#2740
great let me search


[11-Dec-18 08:03 AM] tierralibre#2740
as well I guess the node that is mining this does not need to be connected to the network no?


[11-Dec-18 08:05 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I wouldn’t think so.


[11-Dec-18 08:07 AM] tierralibre#2740
so I guess I could start a node that starts a new weave and get that mining for the addresses. Then I can use the same addresses on the real weave no? Is just crypto keys right?


[11-Dec-18 08:10 AM] tierralibre#2740
now I understand why my wallet was full of addresses. Haha I was running this on my production node and I thought it had to do with naming the local node. Totally did not get this part.


[11-Dec-18 08:13 AM] tierralibre#2740
That explains some of my high CPU in the last days before the restart.  


[11-Dec-18 08:22 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Hahaha good find.


[11-Dec-18 08:23 AM] tierralibre#2740
Like IT Crowd would say, did you switch it on and off? Or is the printer plugged? haha


[11-Dec-18 09:47 AM] ATLAS#7218
@tierralibre Mining address on the new weave has same difficulty as mining on the main weave


[11-Dec-18 09:48 AM] tierralibre#2740
yes. but it wont affect my production weave system


[11-Dec-18 09:48 AM] tierralibre#2740
which is mining now


[11-Dec-18 09:48 AM] tierralibre#2740
this one is just running on my laptop


[11-Dec-18 09:49 AM] ATLAS#7218
 


[11-Dec-18 09:50 AM] tierralibre#2740
man this  mining address challenge was super cool. I just joined too late. @team you are amazing!  


[11-Dec-18 09:51 AM] ATLAS#7218
Yup. That How_about_a_burning_address_zzzzZZZZZZzzzzw had me thinking for a sec hahaha


[11-Dec-18 09:54 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep, somebody else also mined a block with address `0x000...000` lol


[11-Dec-18 09:55 AM] Marcin#0065
but how in earth is it possible to mine those adresses?


[11-Dec-18 09:55 AM] ATLAS#7218
Just put it up as mining_addr


[11-Dec-18 09:55 AM] ATLAS#7218
No need to prove you have the pkey


[11-Dec-18 09:56 AM] Marcin#0065
so the token are basicly burnbed that way?


[11-Dec-18 09:56 AM] Marcin#0065
or does that adress will be visible and as long someone will get the key will be able to reach the tokens?


[11-Dec-18 09:56 AM] ATLAS#7218
It seems `CHe3rs_aRw3av3_FymA0qKuPiecx1yugFEzm1n5nKAQ` didn't receive any rewards yet?


[11-Dec-18 09:57 AM] ATLAS#7218
yup


[11-Dec-18 09:57 AM] ATLAS#7218
Also, maybe you need to get some proof that the miner actually has the private key. Otherwise its not fair for `How_about_a_burning_address_zzzzZZZZZZzzzzw`  


[11-Dec-18 09:59 AM] Marcin#0065
i did a reupdate of the miner, will rereun and wait a day. if there wont any block be mined, i probably consider my machine as too weak already   
to be sure:
{"network":"arweave.N.1","version":5,"release":19
is the newest, right?


[11-Dec-18 09:59 AM] ATLAS#7218
yup


[11-Dec-18 10:10 AM] chriscord#4741
It would be a shame to lose @Marcin this early in the mining process. I hope the team can tweak the algo to ensure rewards are more widely distributed


[11-Dec-18 10:12 AM] chriscord#4741
We all benefit if we can maintain a more diverse distributed network of miners


[11-Dec-18 10:21 AM] Marcin#0065
haha ur sweet   thx
sooner or later it will end that way for everyone, since there is competition. Mining Pools are the only future to keep a network alive by individuals   so lets hope for an mining pool for arweave  


[11-Dec-18 10:23 AM] Marcin#0065
but maybe the update will help, also i restarted the whole machine  


[11-Dec-18 10:25 AM] chriscord#4741
You’re welcome   hope you can get back to mining soon


[11-Dec-18 10:29 AM] Marcin#0065
the mining is working great, and the room is heated up well by it   but its just not powerfull enough compared to the other nodes probably. one block a day would be nice, but  greed is taking over and people build up as hell  


[11-Dec-18 11:19 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Marcin try to sell your threadripper and go intel. They seem to be better. Wish I had hard metrics to back that up


[11-Dec-18 11:19 AM] Vilenarios#8742
But I hope your rewards go up. With 16 threads or whatever u should definitely be getting a block a day by my calculations.


[11-Dec-18 12:03 PM] tierralibre#2740
So when, my node tries to mine and it has no recall block. Is that block stored for next time?


[11-Dec-18 12:03 PM] tierralibre#2740
How can a node ask for blocks to other nodes?


[11-Dec-18 12:04 PM] tierralibre#2740
because the blocks should be in more than one node no? if this needs to really be a global network


[11-Dec-18 12:12 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Yes I believe it will download that recall block at that time.


[11-Dec-18 12:13 PM] Vilenarios#8742
On top of trying to continuously download blocks to the block height.


[11-Dec-18 01:10 PM] Marcin#0065
Tomorrow that time, when no block mined, i will  sell my threadripper and buy myself some cool speaker or go camping with that cash ;)  i am not in the kind of league to even try compete any more. I used to mine bitcoin back then that way, i dont need many AR tokens ;) i just like to follow the developement and creation in the beginning. The moment its stable and only more hash matters, it getting kinda boring, which is good. Im excited for pool mining tho.


[11-Dec-18 01:18 PM] Marcin#0065
I have checked my ip again, and it seems everytime i reconnect, i gather over 100 peers. Its stays that that way for a while until it dramatically decreases to less than half the peers. Do you observe such behaviour too? What could be the reason to not stay connected to the peers? Any blacklisting by mistake? (I havent changed any code xD)


[11-Dec-18 01:27 PM] Marcin#0065
@arweave-sam maybe you have an idea?


[11-Dec-18 01:58 PM] Vilenarios#8742
How do I check the wildfire score of a peer?


[11-Dec-18 02:23 PM] Marcin#0065
Higher clock speee on the amd threadripper causes an drop of 20% of hashrate :S 
Running 3500mhz per core on threadripper gives a way better hashrate than running 4100mhz per core. Just things to know :)


[11-Dec-18 02:38 PM] Vilenarios#8742
haha yeah, i dont overclock any of mine


[11-Dec-18 02:38 PM] Vilenarios#8742
i figure longer CPU lifetime as well


[12-Dec-18 05:33 AM] ATLAS#7218
@Marcin It's just dropping the unnecessary/bad peers


[12-Dec-18 05:34 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@Marcin Around 50 peers is normal and healthy.


[12-Dec-18 05:35 AM] ATLAS#7218
When you give tons of peers in the start, it will have a hard time going through all of them if most of them are down, since it waits for the response for quite a long time.


[12-Dec-18 09:39 PM] The Hawk Tz#3229
hey guys I am getting badarg erlang list_to_binary when attempting to start


[12-Dec-18 09:40 PM] The Hawk Tz#3229
Has anyone come across a fix? Ubuntu 18.04 clean build and used the install.sh script


[12-Dec-18 11:46 PM] The Hawk Tz#3229
I appear to have progressed further


[12-Dec-18 11:47 PM] The Hawk Tz#3229
using just the single node IP above


[12-Dec-18 11:50 PM] The Hawk Tz#3229
removing 'mine' in the start command and only use mining_addr


[13-Dec-18 12:14 AM] ATLAS#7218
Its not mining,if that's okay to you


[13-Dec-18 12:16 AM] ATLAS#7218
`wget https://packages.erlang-solutions.com/erlang-solutions_1.0_all.deb 
sudo dpkg -i erlang-solutions_1.0_all
sudo apt update
sudo apt install erlang`


[13-Dec-18 12:18 AM] ATLAS#7218
Try reinstalling erlang with this command. Then recompile the arweave by doing `make clean && make all` inside arweave folder.


[13-Dec-18 11:05 AM] Marcin#0065
Is there a possibility to check the hashing during mining?
The current benchmark is almost non of use, since it loads one core only. By mining with multiple core there are all those throttelings and so on, so a real szenario benchmark would be way more useful for stats


[13-Dec-18 11:05 AM] Marcin#0065
Best would be to track each core/thread individually ofc :D


[13-Dec-18 01:21 PM] Vilenarios#8742
That’d be cool to see hashrate during mining. I’ve seen many other miners do that.


[13-Dec-18 01:21 PM] Vilenarios#8742
In a perfect world it would tell me my hashrate, network rate and disk performance  


[13-Dec-18 03:06 PM] tierralibre#2740
I am seeing something funny on the log:


[13-Dec-18 03:06 PM] tierralibre#2740
``` {elli_middleware,handle,2,
                [{file,"lib/elli/src/elli_middleware.erl"},{line,64}]},

[13-Dec-18 03:06 PM] tierralibre#2740
what does this mean?


[13-Dec-18 11:39 PM] ivhturp#3325
@Marcin @Vilenarios thats true. We need better benchmarking tools. 
My 32C physical server is performing way worse than 8C virtual machine! 8C has 25% better hashrate per core though  


[14-Dec-18 01:10 AM] tierralibre#2740
So I archived a MD file. On the wallet it appears fine.


[14-Dec-18 01:10 AM] tierralibre#2740
http://wallet-1.nodes.arweave.org:1984/tx/46qhnGbORr5SzRs0-nrf0sgP1-PIIUPMCir2hNXMIX4/data.html


[14-Dec-18 01:10 AM] tierralibre#2740
And my node:


[14-Dec-18 01:10 AM] tierralibre#2740
https://arweave.erm.earth/tx/46qhnGbORr5SzRs0-nrf0sgP1-PIIUPMCir2hNXMIX4


[14-Dec-18 01:11 AM] tierralibre#2740
I see: ```tx_signature_not_valid tx_too_cheap tx_fields_too_large tag_field_illegally_specified tx_id_not_valid ```


[14-Dec-18 01:11 AM] tierralibre#2740
This was archived with the wallet.


[14-Dec-18 01:13 AM] tierralibre#2740
ok I see. my node is not at the same height as the network. How can this be?


[14-Dec-18 01:16 AM] tierralibre#2740
I just changed the blocks before joining  to a higher value and see if that will let me catch up.


[14-Dec-18 01:21 AM] tierralibre#2740
Still this node has been always on, so it should be at the same height I would assume.


[14-Dec-18 01:26 AM] tierralibre#2740
My node: ```{"network":"arweave.N.1","version":5,"release":19,"height":95106,"current":"xJueIFzgbL8XTNpdT_ImYahOSFNtyNRji1FTi-umoL0Qm83Khn08iGIfrOJTweyu","blocks":95776,"peers":30,"queue_length":0,"node_state_latency":20}```

[14-Dec-18 03:41 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@tierralibre What blockheight is the node you're starting from (with the `peer` argument) on?


[14-Dec-18 03:42 AM] tierralibre#2740
now I added the wallet one to my peers too


[14-Dec-18 03:42 AM] tierralibre#2740
to make sure


[14-Dec-18 03:42 AM] tierralibre#2740
I have  full list of peers


[14-Dec-18 03:43 AM] tierralibre#2740
this is my height now

[14-Dec-18 03:43 AM] arweave-martin#1169
Maybe you're starting from an unhealthy node. Try start with only one `peer` argument and make sure it's a healthy one.


[14-Dec-18 03:43 AM] tierralibre#2740

[20-Dec-18 12:10 PM] Marcin#0065
When can we expect to choose what to save and what not to save? Any roadmap or updates regarding that?


[20-Dec-18 12:26 PM] arweave-martin#1169
@Marcin  How do you mean choose? Is there something you don't want to store? There is already support for adding a content policy file where you can specify things you don't want to store.


[20-Dec-18 12:28 PM] Vilenarios#8742
So how does the content policy work?  I need to find the hash of the transaction i want to block?


[20-Dec-18 04:29 PM] Marcin#0065
I dont want to store anything illegal or whatever spreads bad information


[20-Dec-18 04:30 PM] Marcin#0065
How do we can control what get stored. As far i remember there were talks about that choice. As far i see now, my machine stores whatever comes in


[20-Dec-18 04:31 PM] Marcin#0065
Maybe some kind of tutorials (which are far more usefriendly than the mining tutorials) can explaim how we can dump content we dont want to store?


[20-Dec-18 04:31 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Still Marcin - the how will you even know what content you want to block?


[20-Dec-18 04:33 PM] Marcin#0065
Well thats also the job of all of us. If we decide whats bad content, and enough people work together, we can dump the worst i think.
There were talks about a GUI for miners? Somehow it got quiet for a long time about the mining procedure


[20-Dec-18 04:33 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Thats a good point - i guess if someone finds something really terrible uploaded, the community would spread the word


[20-Dec-18 04:36 PM] Marcin#0065
But i wont run my machine much longer, if it keeps downloading all bullcrap. I easily can creaty my own website with fake news, propaganda and more worse bs i dont want to mention here. Then i can use the plugin and simply store that bs on all machines in the network. And nobody cant do anything right now against it. Am i wrong or right?


[20-Dec-18 04:40 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Totally right as far as im aware.  Ive asked the team a few times myself how we can avoid this...


[20-Dec-18 04:49 PM] arweave-india#5075
No, you can delete all of the blocks (or transactions) that you do not want to hold at any time. Simply select the blocks or transactions from their respective folders and delete them.

You can also generate decentralised content policy lists that automatically filter content for you. IIRC, making these easier to generate and load is high on the dev todo list for the new year.


[20-Dec-18 04:51 PM] Marcin#0065
but wont the blocks come back while synchronising?


[20-Dec-18 04:52 PM] arweave-india#5075
No, this is the role of the content policy lists


[20-Dec-18 04:53 PM] Marcin#0065
ive never heard of the lists before, not speaking about even see them in action. would be nice if u show them more actively.
i can imagine arweave as the perfect place for all illegal information, if nobody of the miner care or know how to actively filter agains those kind of data


[20-Dec-18 04:54 PM] Marcin#0065
if arweave becomes the next megaupload, it would be also nice for the popularity, but totally hit the whole idea wrongly


[20-Dec-18 04:55 PM] arweave-india#5075
I think there is a section about them in the lightpaper


[20-Dec-18 04:55 PM] Marcin#0065
well, doesnt sound so sure from you  


[20-Dec-18 04:56 PM] Vilenarios#8742
But to be clear india, content policy lists IS or ISNT available today?


[20-Dec-18 04:56 PM] Marcin#0065
so it doesnt seem to be a high priority in the team?


[20-Dec-18 04:56 PM] Vilenarios#8742
or on the to-do list?


[20-Dec-18 04:57 PM] arweave-india#5075
They have been in the code since launch, but I think the devs are working on making them easier to load.


[20-Dec-18 04:57 PM] Marcin#0065
how does the conten policy work? do i simply put in word i want to filter out? do i manage to watch through all blocks and put in the block number to filter out? i have no clue what it means


[20-Dec-18 04:58 PM] Marcin#0065
on that stage, where u got your ssecond plugin version and make it easier to handle wallets and store webpages, i hugely find it important to think of that topic


[20-Dec-18 04:58 PM] Marcin#0065
i dont want the police storm my house coz they found some childporn pictures on my computer xD


[20-Dec-18 04:59 PM] Marcin#0065
which comes from the arweave network from some dudes who dont weant them in their pc, but load them in the network


[20-Dec-18 05:00 PM] Marcin#0065
im afraid, if there wont be a solution to those topics, which are asked for many months frm time to time, im afraid im too scared. you delivered a product, but it allows everybody do whatever it want with it. it has no controll option from the community now


[20-Dec-18 05:01 PM] Marcin#0065
it worries me


[20-Dec-18 05:02 PM] Vilenarios#8742
good thing nobody can buy tokens to use it


[20-Dec-18 05:02 PM] Vilenarios#8742
 


[20-Dec-18 05:02 PM] Marcin#0065
haha xD


[20-Dec-18 05:03 PM] Marcin#0065
true that  


[20-Dec-18 05:03 PM] Vilenarios#8742
clearly the team has thought of the problem, so we can only hope its addressed properly


[20-Dec-18 05:03 PM] Vilenarios#8742
ill look through the code and see if i can see how it can be done


[20-Dec-18 05:03 PM] Vilenarios#8742
i would imagine its a simple list of the hashes you dont want to store maybe...


[20-Dec-18 05:03 PM] Vilenarios#8742
id be surprised if i coudl put in like "child porn" and have it block that... pretty advanced kind of filtering


[20-Dec-18 05:05 PM] Marcin#0065
there should be a reward system for voting. if i vote for a hash which contains bad stuff, and the community decides im right and most people also vote to block it, me, as the first initiator of the vote, get rewarded for reporting.


[20-Dec-18 05:05 PM] Marcin#0065
it would motivate the community to look for bad stuff


[20-Dec-18 05:05 PM] arweave-india#5075
You can filter by both key words (as you mention @Vilenarios ) as well as the hashes of the data itself


[20-Dec-18 05:05 PM] Marcin#0065
but nobody will care india


[20-Dec-18 05:05 PM] Marcin#0065
unless you motivate them


[20-Dec-18 05:06 PM] Marcin#0065
the idea of communism is also great and idealistic, but history teaches it will not work, coz people are selfish.. and the arweave network can end as a place full of bad stuff


[20-Dec-18 05:07 PM] Marcin#0065
and there are enough people out there whoo seek an anonymous web storage controlled by noone directly


[20-Dec-18 05:10 PM] Marcin#0065
those will be the first questions by anybody whenever that project will get more popular. and as far i see now, there is no good solution to that.


[20-Dec-18 05:11 PM] Marcin#0065
im curious what u will come up with  


[21-Dec-18 03:17 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@Marcin  we are working on a mechanism that will allow you to never store and serve particular data even if it is already a part of the weave.

I agree, we need to document the current firewall as well as the future algorithm for miners.


[21-Dec-18 03:30 AM] Marcin#0065
But how will that correlate with mining? If lets say 40% of the blocks are full of bad data i want to block , which is considered as bad by the community as well, therefore i am not able to mine 40% of the time due to not owning recall blocks?


[21-Dec-18 03:31 AM] Marcin#0065
In such case, my motivation to dump bad data is low, when i want to mine more effectively


[21-Dec-18 03:36 AM] arweave-lev#3466
Every miner has a choice. The important points are 1) you should have an option to opt out from storing and serving certain data; you are not responsible for what other miners do 2) the incentives make it unlikely for the whole network to lose a certain piece of data; although even then there are ways out 3) in general, it's a fundamental tradeoff the censorship-free ecosystem has to face and find its equilibrium point.


[21-Dec-18 04:48 AM] 2072 [ANFRA]#9291
IDEA: it could be interesting to track and store this kind of sentiment along with the stored data. Miners could vote on data to change this score that would be available with the data so that we know somehow that a particular stored element, even if stored in the weave forever, was mostly rejected by the community and considered wrong...  This way nodes would be also able to use this score to filter content servicing automatically or not...

[21-Dec-18 10:53 AM] Bill#8070
how can I update the newest miner?


[21-Dec-18 10:53 AM] Bill#8070
git fetch?


[21-Dec-18 10:57 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@Bill Here is one way of getting the latest stable release: `git fetch --all --tags && git checkout master && git reset --hard stable`


[21-Dec-18 11:23 PM] ivhturp#3325
@arweave-lev 1. Is the data stored in plain text? 2. If encrypted, how would miners know the kind of data that is being stored on the nodes. 3. If illicit content is stored, wouldn't miners be at fault in the eyes of law? How would miners be safe guarded in such scenarios?


[22-Dec-18 12:16 AM] tiamat#9131
@ivhturp  1) uploader chooses to encrypt or not, if he encrypts then that data is pretty much private because it is not accessible without decryption first 2) there is a content policy which each miner can enforce


[22-Dec-18 12:17 AM] tiamat#9131
you can upload encrypted data right now on any cloud even if it's  completely illegal because cloud does not know what you have there


[22-Dec-18 12:48 AM] ivhturp#3325
@tiamat Thanks for reply. Even though content policy exists, identifying illicit content is a challenge. 
Its true that existing clouds are not aware of the content. But in this case individuals i.e., miners will be storing and they will be more vulnerable than the cloud companies who are protected by their legal team. I believe addressing this issue will be a key concern before the momentum picks up for decentralised storage


[22-Dec-18 10:36 AM] arweave-martin#1169
Identifying illicit content is definitely a challenge, as you say @tiamat. There are a lot of things we can do to improve dealing with this for miners, and we already planned to do one improvement in January. Way more improvements will come over time, because this is an important topic.


[22-Dec-18 05:32 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Also I’m pretty sure miners would not be at fault for storing illicit data


[22-Dec-18 05:32 PM] Vilenarios#8742
HOWEVeR we would have to provide said data to authorities if there was a subpoena.


[22-Dec-18 05:32 PM] Vilenarios#8742
From a US law perspective


[22-Dec-18 05:33 PM] Vilenarios#8742
If you get an Office 365 subscription and store kiddy porn there, Microsoft certainly won’t get arrested.  But they will hand over the info of who uploaded/owns the data.


[22-Dec-18 05:49 PM] Vilenarios#8742
But we all know big corporations are pretty much above the law...


[23-Dec-18 03:52 AM] Bill#8070
If I dont have a public ipv4 address, can I mine arweave?


[23-Dec-18 04:37 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@Bill If you are behind the NAT, you need to set up port forwarding so that incoming requests with the port 1984 are routed to your machine. Some VPN services offer the port forwarding feature. There would be some improvements in this area in the beginning of the next year.


[23-Dec-18 05:08 AM] Vilenarios#8742
You can use the “polling” parameter if you can’t use port forwarding.


[23-Dec-18 05:09 AM] Vilenarios#8742
It’s 6% less efficient with mining though, and you can’t actually serve content from the blockweave since no one will be able to get to your node without port forwarding/load balancing n

Man one of these days I’m gonna do some analysis on these wallet addresses


[24-Dec-18 06:02 AM] Vilenarios#8742
It seems like most blocks get mined by the same few addresses. But really need to extrapolate the data and see.


[24-Dec-18 06:02 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Idk how multiple blocks can get mined within the same minute.


[24-Dec-18 07:39 AM] tiamat#9131
welcome to PoW, where you can have 3 blocks withing seconds and then wait 10 minutes for the 4th


[24-Dec-18 07:45 AM] tiamat#9131
but that 2h gap is kind of concerning


[24-Dec-18 07:45 AM] tiamat#9131
was it really a bad luck PoW or something else?


[24-Dec-18 07:52 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Idk I didn’t look at the logs but considering blocks can be mined in sub minutes, a 2 hour block would be pretty low odds...


[24-Dec-18 08:03 AM] Marcin#0065
But since the 2h my machine is complete off the network. It was fine for weeks, i didnt even set up remote control for that week. Did you had a dc during that 2h too?

@ATLAS   it should be able to continue to mine and discard some of the blocks. When there will be terabytes of data stored almost no one will be able to store the whole chain. This case has to be handled. There is a disk_space parameter to explicitly limit disk usage, I'm using it (@chriscord :it's set at 32)


[27-Dec-18 02:52 PM] 2072 [ANFRA]#9291
I've commented on issue #34: https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/issues/34


[28-Dec-18 01:48 AM] Marcin#0065
So hashing should continue without storing new block, but getting rewards if new block calculated? Maybe RAM could be used to store the calculated block for some time to get rewarded? If all regular disk get full, the network will lose many miner, if noone can hash any more xD


[28-Dec-18 02:52 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Well mining a new block requires the recall block


[28-Dec-18 02:52 AM] Vilenarios#8742
So if the chain is 1TB and you only have 100GB then you only got a 10% chance of being able to mine new blocks.


[28-Dec-18 02:53 AM] Vilenarios#8742
From what I can see, to mine the most you need the full chain. Period.


[28-Dec-18 02:53 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Maybe when storage pools come out then mining new blocks without the full chain would be possible.


[28-Dec-18 02:55 AM] Vilenarios#8742
My arweave folder is around 34GB total at the moment, which is still reaaaally tiny when you think about it.


[28-Dec-18 03:13 AM] Marcin#0065
The concept of the recall block should be clear to everybody by now :D but if you have a full disk, and you have the recall block on it, but no space left for further blocks, what will happen? At least a full X-TB disk should be able to be part of the network and hash for it without adding space on the disk.

difficulty is down... number of nodes is down... yet the blocks i find is also down


[29-Dec-18 05:16 AM] Vilenarios#8742
so perhaps the hashrate increased for some of the other, already large/powerful miners? idk


[29-Dec-18 05:30 AM] Marcin#0065
sam mentioned once there are many miner from asia. probably getting more hashpower :D by watching the variarity of the adresses, is just a very small number of miners


[29-Dec-18 05:32 AM] Marcin#0065
watching the afterward result, it would be way more clever to NOT invest in ICO phase. rather take the money and buy some CPU and get more tokens by computing. 
its weird that way, but it is as it is.
just from the point of token reward view


[29-Dec-18 05:35 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Yeah I have made double the AR that I purchased in ICO already... shoulda spent that money on more intel cpu.


[29-Dec-18 06:40 AM] tierralibre#2740
Well once can say arweave really rewards miners  


[29-Dec-18 06:41 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Haha yeah especially if you are one of those main miners who have earned more than 50k arweave already.  Wish I knew what they were running.


[29-Dec-18 07:09 AM] Marcin#0065
they proclaimed to reward people mainly for storage and bandwith. in the end its the same sauce as usual and the pure hash power is the main key to be rewarded. 
Its one point of few which lead me firstly to be supportive for the project, but then, as for today i lose emphaty daily towards arweave. its gonna end as all icos project. I cannot see a longterm future today for arweave as it is now, too many unanswered questions regarding illicit data, liquidity, reward system, long term financing and so on. i wish they would get few years for development and more people working on it.

Is the new work algorithm ProgWork that is being mentioned in the end of year update ProgPOW? 
https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW


[29-Dec-18 07:54 AM] tierralibre#2740
@Marcin  Maybe not perfect now. But I do believe in this team. They raised money quite in stealth. With that they can make it better. Is not easy to build software.  I have been involved in start-ups myself, 2 died. Is really, really difficult to do something from 0 to 1. The last one is going very well. I guess we all know more now. But is really, really difficult to raise money. And I don't think the Arweave team took the cash and retired in the Caribbean. I am sure they will get to your concerns.


[29-Dec-18 08:27 AM] Marcin#0065
the team is great, no doubt about it. 
the project is also fantastic, as the idea of it.


[29-Dec-18 12:19 PM] tiamat#9131
@Marcin I have to agree that illicit data needs to be addressed asap because you never know when it starts to cause issues


[29-Dec-18 12:19 PM] tiamat#9131
right now it is the Sword of Damocles


[29-Dec-18 12:23 PM] tiamat#9131
but overall we are still doing pretty good, I follow other projects where networks keep hanging, teams come up with centralized fixes


[29-Dec-18 12:23 PM] tiamat#9131
even Zilliqa has a lot of issues and delays


[29-Dec-18 12:35 PM] Vilenarios#8742
sword of damocles... what you mean?


[29-Dec-18 12:39 PM] Vilenarios#8742
" unanswered questions regarding illicit data, liquidity, reward system, long term financing" agree on this 100%, i hope the team adressess them clearly and formally at some point in the near future.   i believe they are all off on holiday, rightfully so

[29-Dec-18 07:05 PM] 2072 [ANFRA]#9291
I've opened a issue on Github concerning the illicit data problem: https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/issues/107


[29-Dec-18 09:52 PM] Marcin#0065
nice 2072  


[29-Dec-18 09:53 PM] Marcin#0065
arweave may become the next megaupload :D with that little tiny difference, that the fbi will have some trouble to shut it down ;) unless they buy all tokens at ome point ;)


[30-Dec-18 12:54 PM] JW#2445
Hi Team, just looked at the NKN dashboard. https://nknx.org/ Looks really nice. Perhaps it is something that can easily be developed for Arweave as well.

[31-Dec-18 06:50 AM] y3v63n | moonli.me#0177
Hey, can I have Arveawe's mining guide?


[31-Dec-18 06:54 AM] ATLAS#7218
@Dimilian I'm pretty sure your port is blocked


[31-Dec-18 06:55 AM] ATLAS#7218
Forward 1984 from router/unblock 1984 on your firewall


[31-Dec-18 06:55 AM] ATLAS#7218
@y3v63n | moonli.me Sadly, team does evwrything by email so you would have to contact them via team@arweave.org.


[31-Dec-18 06:56 AM] ATLAS#7218
I really hate emails. Takes too much time and very inconvenient for conversations


[01-Jan-19 08:23 AM] ATLAS#7218
Why do you need to send email to get mining instructions?


[01-Jan-19 08:23 AM] ATLAS#7218
Everything is questionable. Its like you guys don't want new people to come in


[01-Jan-19 08:24 AM] 2072 [ANFRA]#9291
It's because they want to be able to contact miners and node operators easily
in case there is an update required for the health of the network etc...


[01-Jan-19 08:24 AM] ATLAS#7218
Nope.


[01-Jan-19 08:24 AM] ATLAS#7218
You can't associate a node with an email


[01-Jan-19 08:24 AM] ATLAS#7218
Its like we are in 90s


[01-Jan-19 08:25 AM] ATLAS#7218
Then just mail everyone. Make a notice in TG and Discord


[01-Jan-19 08:25 AM] ATLAS#7218
WTF?


[01-Jan-19 08:27 AM] ATLAS#7218
New miners have to mail the team to set it up? Is that decentralization? Its like getting permission from the team


[01-Jan-19 08:27 AM] 2072 [ANFRA]#9291
if the instructions for mining are just posted on the internet, there is no guarantee that the miner will subscribe to any communication channel and if the miner is important enough this could lead to problems in this eraly stage of debeloppment


[01-Jan-19 08:28 AM] ATLAS#7218
When Sam said that they don't want centralize and associate the Arweave project to the team, I respected that he thinks that way. But the actions are not showing the same


[01-Jan-19 08:28 AM] ATLAS#7218
The early stage is over


[01-Jan-19 08:28 AM] ATLAS#7218
If its vulnerable and wants the mailing service as its security I'm out of here


[01-Jan-19 08:29 AM] ATLAS#7218
Its not a testnet anymore


[01-Jan-19 08:29 AM] ATLAS#7218
If it was testnet, that fully makes sense. But its not just a testnet where you can play with everything


[01-Jan-19 08:29 AM] ATLAS#7218
Now it concerns every user, their money and time investment.


[01-Jan-19 08:37 AM] tiamat#9131
anyone can run a miner


[01-Jan-19 08:37 AM] tiamat#9131
you don't need permission from team@


[01-Jan-19 08:38 AM] tiamat#9131
and yeah, a link to a mining guide would be better than email to blabla for mining guide


[01-Jan-19 08:39 AM] tiamat#9131
like @2072 [ANFRA] I think they only want to collect miner emails to contact them in case of an update/fork


[01-Jan-19 08:53 AM] ATLAS#7218
I didn't say they need permission literally but its nearly like that atm


[01-Jan-19 08:53 AM] ATLAS#7218
And those fork infos should be public instead of only known miners


[01-Jan-19 08:53 AM] ATLAS#7218
What if there is some miners which got to know about arweave from friends


[01-Jan-19 08:54 AM] ATLAS#7218
When I make a valid criticism I don't like how this community receives


[01-Jan-19 08:55 AM] ATLAS#7218
Its constuctive criticism but everyone rejects without valid reason and sides with arweave team. *Its not only this*


[01-Jan-19 08:57 AM] ATLAS#7218
EVERY INFO SHOULD BE PUBLIC. Or should I make every email I receive into a post? This is pure bullshit and you guys supporting this idea is making me... dumbfounded.


[01-Jan-19 09:25 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I agree with you baz. Gotta be public somewhere... easily searchable and accessible.


[01-Jan-19 09:32 AM] Marcin#0065
I didnt know its not public


[01-Jan-19 09:33 AM] Marcin#0065
I believed its on github all time?


[01-Jan-19 09:33 AM] Marcin#0065
Isnt it?


[01-Jan-19 09:34 AM] ATLAS#7218
README.md has no info but install.sh gives some script


[01-Jan-19 09:34 AM] ATLAS#7218
you would have to chmod it to make it executable


[01-Jan-19 09:35 AM] ATLAS#7218
But not everyone is tech savvy.


[01-Jan-19 09:36 AM] ATLAS#7218
I have no issue at all. I even made a script for myself which downloads my blocks and completely sets up mining client on fresh ubuntu but I'm talking about new comers.


[01-Jan-19 09:37 AM] ATLAS#7218
Everytime I take a peek in TG I see someone asking how to setup a miner and some admin just asks to send an email. Literally feels like flipping my table everytime I read that crap


[01-Jan-19 09:41 AM] Marcin#0065
On github i found that


[01-Jan-19 09:41 AM] Marcin#0065
I cant upload images?


[01-Jan-19 09:42 AM] Marcin#0065
From github:
Ubuntu/Debian Linux Quickstart

You can download the Arweave codebase, all dependencies and start mining straight away by opening a terminal and running:
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/master/install.sh | bash && cd arweave && ./arweave-server mine peer xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx peer yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy
Don’t forget to change xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy, etc to the IP addresses you want to peer with.


[01-Jan-19 09:43 AM] ATLAS#7218
Then why not just give that info instead of asking for email


[01-Jan-19 09:44 AM] Marcin#0065
I dont k ow


[01-Jan-19 09:45 AM] Marcin#0065
Know


[01-Jan-19 09:45 AM] Marcin#0065
But everyone using google 2 minutes can have that info too


[01-Jan-19 09:46 AM] ATLAS#7218
Why not ask newcomers to google the info then?


[01-Jan-19 09:46 AM] ATLAS#7218
Is that how you handle the new people?


[01-Jan-19 09:47 AM] ATLAS#7218
This project is far from getting new users. Even the community has some weird mentality.


[01-Jan-19 10:16 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Hey @ATLAS, we ask people to email us so we can update miners on any important updates, as mentioned by @2072 [ANFRA]. However, we are actually in the process of making all documentation available in one place on Gitbook, and this includes the mining guide. As I say, we're working on that right now and we will publish and share it once all documentation has been uploaded for each relevant area.


[01-Jan-19 10:17 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Drop me a DM or email team@arweave.org if you would like a mining guide @y3v63n | moonli.me ⛏


[01-Jan-19 11:54 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Hi all! Can you tell me about the technical characteristics of the server for mining?


[01-Jan-19 11:55 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
How much disk does blockchain occupy now? What makes sense to put on the server: a more powerful processor or a larger disk?


[01-Jan-19 11:59 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Hi slayer


[01-Jan-19 12:00 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Right now it’s all about CPU


[01-Jan-19 12:00 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Then network


[01-Jan-19 12:00 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
What is minimal HDD amount?


[01-Jan-19 12:00 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Arweave folder  is under 40GB total still


[01-Jan-19 12:01 PM] Vilenarios#8742
A 4 core Ubuntu server in Azure averages a block a day.


[01-Jan-19 12:01 PM] Vilenarios#8742
For me at least.


[01-Jan-19 12:02 PM] Vilenarios#8742
As soon as a good upload tool is created I would imagine storage requirements will jump.


[01-Jan-19 12:02 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Then we separate men from the boys  


[01-Jan-19 12:02 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
What AR in one block?


[01-Jan-19 12:03 PM] Vilenarios#8742
34 I think


[01-Jan-19 12:03 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
34 AR per day?


[01-Jan-19 12:31 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Yes from my 4 cpu cloud miner.


[01-Jan-19 12:31 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Thank you


[01-Jan-19 12:31 PM] Vilenarios#8742
It’s odd though , some days it’s a lot more some days it’s 0


[01-Jan-19 12:32 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Need to sync full blockchain first to get maximum miner velocity


[01-Jan-19 12:40 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
How average is the processor loaded?


[01-Jan-19 12:45 PM] Vilenarios#8742
That’s up to you


[01-Jan-19 12:46 PM] Vilenarios#8742
You can determine how many cores are in use. If you don’t then it will run 100% on all cores


[01-Jan-19 01:00 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Ok. Thanks, man


[01-Jan-19 01:44 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
So. I start mining, but i don't see any CPU, HDD or network activity. Peers from PDF Mining Guide is right?


[01-Jan-19 02:11 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
How long can sync take?


[01-Jan-19 03:11 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Yeah you won’t see much actvitity when you start mining


[01-Jan-19 03:12 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Blockchain sync takes a while.... probably a few days at best


[01-Jan-19 04:06 PM] Mason Black#0187
Thats worrying, if it takes days to sync now where nobody is even really using it, what about when real use comes? Weeks, months?


[01-Jan-19 04:16 PM] ATLAS#7218
@arweave-sophie I told my friends about arweave so they won't receive the updates? Important updates should be public. Why is it only sent to 'known' miners?


[01-Jan-19 04:17 PM] ATLAS#7218
Just admit how poorly its handled


[02-Jan-19 01:34 AM] tierralibre#2740
@Mason Black there is a parameter that defines how many blocks you will download before connecting. I thiink default is to 50 if that is the case it should not take days to sync.


[02-Jan-19 01:34 AM] tierralibre#2740
are you trying to download the whole weave?


[02-Jan-19 01:35 AM] tierralibre#2740
https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/blob/master/src/ar.hrl


[02-Jan-19 01:35 AM] tierralibre#2740
```%% @doc The number of blocks behind the most recent block to store.
-define(STORE_BLOCKS_BEHIND_CURRENT, 50).```


[02-Jan-19 01:53 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@Mason Black I think that the problem may be in originally indicated peers. Will this work if, in principle, do not specify peers in the command line?


[02-Jan-19 01:54 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
That is, the startup line looks like this:
/root/arweave/arweave-server mine mining_addr YOUR-MINING-ADDRESS


[02-Jan-19 01:55 AM] tierralibre#2740
you can always add at least a peer you know is good. like the wallet node


[02-Jan-19 01:55 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Will it work? Or is it necessary to specify peers in any case?


[02-Jan-19 01:56 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@tierralibre ok, thanks


[02-Jan-19 01:57 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Is there a more complete list of peers anywhere? 25-50 peers


[02-Jan-19 01:57 AM] tierralibre#2740
if you start with a good node, other peers will be added


[02-Jan-19 01:58 AM] tierralibre#2740
159.65.213.43 is the IP for wallet-1.nodes.arweave.org


[02-Jan-19 01:59 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Hm... That is, the speed will not be higher, even if I have a 10G connection?


[02-Jan-19 01:59 AM] tierralibre#2740
http://159.65.213.43:1984/peers


[02-Jan-19 01:59 AM] tierralibre#2740
will give a list of all the peers the node is connected


[02-Jan-19 01:59 AM] tierralibre#2740
if you start with the wallet node  and you have the setting to 50 blocks you should be connected soon


[02-Jan-19 02:00 AM] tierralibre#2740
you can do a make log inside of the arweave directory to see what is going on


[02-Jan-19 02:00 AM] tierralibre#2740
which blocks you are downloading and how many more you need.


[02-Jan-19 02:02 AM] tierralibre#2740
if you look at the node info: http://159.65.213.43:1984


[02-Jan-19 02:02 AM] tierralibre#2740
this node  has all the blocks


[02-Jan-19 02:03 AM] tierralibre#2740
```{"network":"arweave.N.1","version":5,"release":19,"height":113368,"current":"i8rgiYEu8eZ30ZTTPL-R-XYQkB_ciFBHN3VbwEF1y3YsL0XGIX4GmbcHuc1WnkR8","blocks":132768,"peers":36,"queue_length":0,"node_state_latency":16}```


[02-Jan-19 02:04 AM] tierralibre#2740
so it should be a good bootstraper.


[02-Jan-19 02:07 AM] tierralibre#2740
about speed I am not sure what you mean. When I start a fresh node with 50 blocks to download, I am connected in some minutes. It does not take too long but these are servers on the cloud so they have really good connection.


[02-Jan-19 02:09 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Now i add all nodes and restart my node. Waiting...


[02-Jan-19 02:09 AM] tierralibre#2740
are you on which OS? if you go to the folder where the arweave is and do "make log"


[02-Jan-19 02:09 AM] tierralibre#2740
in the terminal


[02-Jan-19 02:09 AM] tierralibre#2740
what do you see?


[02-Jan-19 02:10 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Now i see next message:
{"network":"arweave.N.1","version":5,"release":19,"height":113371,"current":"77ewL5IXBRkKv9aqaiJjk-haAS_8Qv4iKrANf24qNXmyf7p3KICLKlTttPsWkwua","blocks":10442,"peers":84,"queue_length":0,"node_state_latency":13}


[02-Jan-19 02:12 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@tierralibre Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
Something is being done, recall blocks appear periodically and the list of peers is updated.


[02-Jan-19 02:12 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
I think sync is not over


[02-Jan-19 02:12 AM] tierralibre#2740
do a make log


[02-Jan-19 02:12 AM] tierralibre#2740
then you know


[02-Jan-19 02:13 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@tierralibre i make.


[02-Jan-19 02:13 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Something is being done, recall blocks appear periodically and the list of peers is updated.


[02-Jan-19 02:13 AM] tierralibre#2740
can you paste the log


[02-Jan-19 02:13 AM] tierralibre#2740
the last lines

[02-Jan-19 02:13 AM] tierralibre#2740
so you are connected


[02-Jan-19 02:13 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
I know )


[02-Jan-19 02:14 AM] tierralibre#2740
so what is the problem?


[02-Jan-19 02:14 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
So long sync. Can i speed it up?


[02-Jan-19 02:14 AM] tierralibre#2740
you already synced you are synced


[02-Jan-19 02:14 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
ok


[02-Jan-19 02:14 AM] tierralibre#2740
you just don't have the block that is asking for mining


[02-Jan-19 02:15 AM] tierralibre#2740
you can change the parameter I mentioned if you want to store more blocks in initial sync


[02-Jan-19 02:15 AM] tierralibre#2740
downloading the whole weave, that can take some time.


[02-Jan-19 02:15 AM] tierralibre#2740
in the weave you don't need to have the whole chain on your computer


[02-Jan-19 02:15 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Where can I change it and what values?


[02-Jan-19 02:16 AM] tierralibre#2740
tierralibreToday at 8:34 AM


[02-Jan-19 02:16 AM] tierralibre#2740
I posted there the info. About the value, is up to you, how many blocks do you want to store before connecting.


[02-Jan-19 02:18 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Need to make changes to this file and rebuild?


[02-Jan-19 02:18 AM] tierralibre#2740
yes. but only if you want to store more blocks than the default when before you connect to the network


[02-Jan-19 02:19 AM] tierralibre#2740
then once you are at the level you want maybe is a good idea to put it back how it was.


[02-Jan-19 02:19 AM] tierralibre#2740
if not every time you reboot is going to try to download whatever blocks you put there.


[02-Jan-19 02:20 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
I see the same values that you showed me. Does it make sense to reduce them?


[02-Jan-19 02:20 AM] tierralibre#2740
I don't really understand what you want to achieve.


[02-Jan-19 02:20 AM] tierralibre#2740
You are connected now. Is all good


[02-Jan-19 02:21 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
I want to reduce the initial load time of the entire blockchain.


[02-Jan-19 02:22 AM] tierralibre#2740
arweave does not download the whole weave when it connects. it uses the value in that parameter to say how many blocks is going to download before connecting. 50 is the default.


[02-Jan-19 02:22 AM] tierralibre#2740
if you want to store less and connect you can put something like 5


[02-Jan-19 02:22 AM] tierralibre#2740
50 should be good. and in arweave if you don't have the recall block you can not mine


[02-Jan-19 02:22 AM] tierralibre#2740
so if you have 5 blocks you have less chance of mining


[02-Jan-19 02:22 AM] tierralibre#2740
that is if you what you want is to mine


[02-Jan-19 02:23 AM] tierralibre#2740
but if you want to connect to the network as quick as possible yes, you can change that parameter to 5 for example.


[02-Jan-19 02:23 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Okay, then I'm just waiting.


[02-Jan-19 02:23 AM] tierralibre#2740
you are already connected


[02-Jan-19 02:24 AM] tierralibre#2740
you have more than 50 blocks


[02-Jan-19 02:24 AM] tierralibre#2740
not sure what you mean wait


[02-Jan-19 02:25 AM] tierralibre#2740
if you mean wait to mine a block. yes then you wait.   and if it happens that you have the recall block then you will start mining.


[02-Jan-19 02:25 AM] tierralibre#2740
if not you will store the block so next time you have it.


[02-Jan-19 02:27 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
During the night I saw attempts at mining and recall blocks. They were able to 1/3 (unfortunately there are no logs anymore, since I restarted the node).


[02-Jan-19 02:30 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@slayer_hellraiser  when you join the weave, the node downloads the last 50 blocks and stops there. It does not attempt to download older blocks. Older blocks still slowly arrive as recall blocks so that the node can validate them though.


[02-Jan-19 02:39 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-lev What AR in one block?


[02-Jan-19 03:14 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@slayer_hellraiser the base reward is now around 35 AR, as @Vilenarios has pointed out. It slowly changes over time according to a function of height - https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/blob/N.1.6.0.0/src/ar_inflation.erl#L33. You get additional reward if you include transactions, the amount increases with the transaction size.

[02-Jan-19 03:16 AM] Marcin#0065
@tierralibre i wouldnt change the value ;) unless u wanna get blacklisted ;) but it works, i tried it too, but not worth it


[02-Jan-19 03:17 AM] Marcin#0065
@slayer_hellraiser its already fast ;) in relation. We used to wait weeks to fully sync xD


[02-Jan-19 03:17 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-lev thanks


[02-Jan-19 03:18 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@Marcin Ohh..


[02-Jan-19 03:18 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Really weeks?


[02-Jan-19 03:19 AM] tierralibre#2740
@Marcin why do you get blacklisted if you change the value?


[02-Jan-19 03:19 AM] Marcin#0065
@slayer_hellraiser if u restart the node, just repeat the "make log" command every time. Wait until you rebuild and connected the network, and then fire up "make log" again


[02-Jan-19 03:20 AM] Marcin#0065
@tierralibre some kind of triggers probably. 
My record was around 2k blocks in one row. But it was in times, when one block per 30 seconds. Today its much much faster


[02-Jan-19 03:21 AM] Marcin#0065
If u change the value, you force your first peer to constantly send you blocks, which is bad for the peer, since it uses much network just for you


[02-Jan-19 03:21 AM] Marcin#0065
So its limited to 50. It was 100 before


[02-Jan-19 03:22 AM] Marcin#0065
We needed around 1 hour to even connect.
Sam and his Team really did improve a lot, so thanks for that, no reason to complain :D


[02-Jan-19 03:23 AM] tierralibre#2740
Thank you @Marcin that makes sense.


[02-Jan-19 03:24 AM] Marcin#0065
Blacklisting lasts 24 hours


[02-Jan-19 03:24 AM] Marcin#0065
So to try out stuff its not that bad ;)


[02-Jan-19 03:25 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Guys, how does the mined block look like in the log?


[02-Jan-19 03:26 AM] Marcin#0065
"2/3 you proposed a block to the network"

"3/3 your block got accepted by the network"

Sort of that

[02-Jan-19 03:27 AM] Marcin#0065
Its not written in the log

How often are blocks produced? 1 minutes, 5 minutes?


[02-Jan-19 04:09 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
or other?


[02-Jan-19 04:27 AM] tiamat#9131
~2 minutes


[02-Jan-19 04:51 AM] tierralibre#2740
This has been asked before, but to get an idea. (We are writing a paper on this) what would be th cost of AR to archive 2000 megs of small files each. And what was the cost of AR estimated like 1 AR == +- 1 Euro?


[02-Jan-19 04:52 AM] tierralibre#2740
That was the volume of data which was subpoenaed by the New York attorney general office from Exxon. So we are trying  to understand what would have been the cost of archiving that.


[02-Jan-19 05:15 AM] Marcin#0065
in the code we got that atm:

%% @doc Winstons per AR.
-define(WINSTON_PER_AR, 1000000000000).

%% The base cost of a byte in AR
-define(BASE_BYTES_PER_AR, 10000000).

its in "ar.hrl"


[02-Jan-19 05:16 AM] tierralibre#2740
Thank you @Marcin


[02-Jan-19 05:17 AM] tierralibre#2740
So 1 AR 10 megs


[02-Jan-19 05:17 AM] tierralibre#2740
and 1 AR about 1  - 2 euros? I know this last one is difficult as the only refernec was the ICO


[02-Jan-19 05:18 AM] tierralibre#2740
when ETH was on the roof


[02-Jan-19 05:20 AM] tierralibre#2740
as well is going to be funny when AR starts trading. Because it has intrinsic value. So one value will be by speculators another by  miners. == real cost of running a node.


[02-Jan-19 05:20 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
ICO price is 0,73 USD As i know


[02-Jan-19 05:20 AM] tierralibre#2740
thank you @slayer_hellraiser  that is at current ETH price?


[02-Jan-19 05:21 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@tierralibre OTC maybe 1000 AR per 1 ETH.


[02-Jan-19 05:21 AM] tierralibre#2740
thank you


[02-Jan-19 05:22 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
But it is very approximate.


[02-Jan-19 05:22 AM] tierralibre#2740
Is just to get an idea. We will write that all this is aproximation.


[02-Jan-19 05:24 AM] Marcin#0065
2000000000 byte cost therefore 20000000000000000 Winston xD am i getting crazy here?


[02-Jan-19 05:25 AM] tierralibre#2740
I am trying to get the price in Euros or Dollars


[02-Jan-19 05:25 AM] tierralibre#2740
something people understand


[02-Jan-19 05:25 AM] tierralibre#2740
(with a big note saying this is approximation only for the purposes of explaining).


[02-Jan-19 05:26 AM] Marcin#0065
20000000000000000 Winston is 20000 AR


[02-Jan-19 05:28 AM] Marcin#0065
but i might missed or added some 0   so pls be careful and let the Team answer that officially


[02-Jan-19 05:29 AM] tierralibre#2740
yes, I will, this is only for the draft.  My current math says:  0.13 * 20000 = 2600 Euros for 2000 megs


[02-Jan-19 05:29 AM] tierralibre#2740
It does sound like a lot though


[02-Jan-19 05:29 AM] tierralibre#2740
so i am not sure if this is correct.


[02-Jan-19 05:30 AM] Marcin#0065
the price is based on the ico price i guess


[02-Jan-19 05:30 AM] Marcin#0065
and i dont believe it stays that high


[02-Jan-19 05:30 AM] tierralibre#2740
it is with 1000 AR == 130 euros


[02-Jan-19 05:30 AM] tierralibre#2740
which is todays ETH price


[02-Jan-19 05:30 AM] tierralibre#2740
1000 AR == 1 ETH


[02-Jan-19 05:31 AM] Marcin#0065
i dont know what data storage in dropbox costs, lets say 2000 MB for 50 years?


[02-Jan-19 05:32 AM] tierralibre#2740
actually it is corrcet 130 / 1000 =  0.13 Euros == 1 AR


[02-Jan-19 05:33 AM] tierralibre#2740
that is a very valid point, thank you for that @Marcin  good to link to to that


[02-Jan-19 05:38 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Dropbox will keep this amount for free)) Non-free tariffs start higher, as I recall @Marcin


[02-Jan-19 05:40 AM] Marcin#0065
a quick search gives me in europe 10 Euro per months or 100 Euros per year for 2TB.

makes 5000 Euros in 50 years for 2 TB, whereas the prices will probably drop in regard to the given Storage.

compared to arweave we get 2GB for 2600 Euos - 2TB for 2600000 euros. LOL ? xD

i hope there will be better price politics  


[02-Jan-19 05:40 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
1 TB have price 8,25 USD per month


[02-Jan-19 05:41 AM] tierralibre#2740
Is funny one though. Because even with these prices, It does not pay off to mine.


[02-Jan-19 05:44 AM] tierralibre#2740
So if it becomes cheaper, it will not be worth it, at least for money.


[02-Jan-19 06:33 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Well not all data needs to be put in AR I don’t think. And some types of data will just never make sense.


[02-Jan-19 06:33 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Blueray movies on AR? Don’t think so...


[02-Jan-19 06:33 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Read/write office documents on AR? Nope


[02-Jan-19 06:34 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Will be interesting to see how miners react to larger data sets and price changes...


[02-Jan-19 06:35 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Gets me super excited though!


[02-Jan-19 06:38 AM] arweave-lev#3466
The dependency on the data size is not linear. Starting from 10MB the prices grow exponentially to respect the optimal network throughput. It is prohibitively expensive to post a single huge tx to the network. On the other hand posting 1000 1MB transactions should cost around 120 AR. You can find more details here - https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/blob/N.1.6.0.0/src/ar_tx.erl#L204. Also, there is an HTTP endpoint giving estimations: /price/<size-in-bytes>. It responds with a price in Winston so divide by 1000000000000.

Is arweave gonna do a BitcoinTalk post on mining? I know a lot of people look for new things to mine there.


[02-Jan-19 07:01 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@Vilenarios i participate with same question


[02-Jan-19 07:39 AM] tiamat#9131
what was the final answer for cost per GB? It seems to me ~22 USD / GB @tierralibre


[02-Jan-19 07:47 AM] tiamat#9131
and yeah, it's going to be funny on exchange, AR is one of the very few coins I know with intrinsic value,  Golem will be like this, Factom maybe and those supply chains coins


[02-Jan-19 07:56 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Once AR is used to archive something, it’s locked?


[02-Jan-19 08:03 AM] tierralibre#2740
I think it goes to whoever mines the block on fees. The used AR


[02-Jan-19 08:05 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Got it. Thx Tierra


[02-Jan-19 08:06 AM] tierralibre#2740
Np


[02-Jan-19 08:25 AM] tiamat#9131
a part goes to whoever mines the block and a part is distributed gradually to whoever hosts it


[02-Jan-19 08:25 AM] tiamat#9131
there is a pending pool


[02-Jan-19 08:40 AM] chriscord#4741
@Vilenarios I don’t think we want a flood of miners coming in too early before actual data transactions. As that will drive the cost of mining way up and push out existing/new miners


[02-Jan-19 08:41 AM] chriscord#4741
Ultimately if mining is shown to be profitable, after exchange and data transactions, more miners will join the network


[02-Jan-19 08:43 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Very true @chriscord and part of me wants AR mining to be as private as possible for now... but we need more of a community than just a discord channel in the end.


[02-Jan-19 08:44 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I’m sure we will get there in due time.


[02-Jan-19 08:45 AM] chriscord#4741
Yes exciting times ahead


[02-Jan-19 08:47 AM] chriscord#4741
I also don’t know if it makes sense to estimate a price per MB at the moment as the market is still inefficient without an actual exchange


[02-Jan-19 08:49 AM] chriscord#4741
If you peg AR to eth, as above, then it means Arweave was significantly over valued at ico, private sale etc


[02-Jan-19 08:50 AM] chriscord#4741
It would be interesting to learn from the team which forces will drive the token price


[02-Jan-19 08:53 AM] chriscord#4741
I was looking at the token distribution and it doesn’t look like miners will have any influence for a long time. Because a large percentage of tokens are controlled by investors and the team


[02-Jan-19 08:58 AM] tierralibre#2740
@chriscord  the reason for the estimation is because we are presenting something that will work on the weave and we need to explain it to normal people. Is only educational.


[02-Jan-19 08:59 AM] tierralibre#2740
people will definetely ask this question. I would. so we need to be prepared


[02-Jan-19 09:09 AM] chriscord#4741
@tierralibre sounds good, got it


[02-Jan-19 09:16 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Another way to look at it


[02-Jan-19 09:18 AM] Vilenarios#8742
My cloud server costs me approx 150 USD per month, and on average gets at least 1 block a day.  So that’s approx 34 AR per day x 31 days a month = 1054 AR per month for 150USD. Giving me a break even at 14 cents an AR.


[02-Jan-19 09:19 AM] tierralibre#2740
how big is your box?


[02-Jan-19 09:19 AM] Vilenarios#8742
4 cpu, 8 gb ram, 64 GB storage.


[02-Jan-19 09:19 AM] Vilenarios#8742
So as soon as difficult/size goes up so does my breakeven.


[02-Jan-19 09:20 AM] tierralibre#2740
I have a 8xcore 8 gigs of ram and  i don't get one block a day


[02-Jan-19 09:30 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Cloud hosted?


[02-Jan-19 09:31 AM] Vilenarios#8742
The performance of my cloud box is more consistent than my onprem intel i9-7920x


[02-Jan-19 09:35 AM] tierralibre#2740
yes cloud hosted


[02-Jan-19 09:35 AM] tierralibre#2740
and 200GB hardrive


[02-Jan-19 09:36 AM] tierralibre#2740
I have been mining for over a month and max I get is about 50 AR per month.


[02-Jan-19 09:39 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Woa... u at full block height?


[02-Jan-19 09:39 AM] tierralibre#2740
yes


[02-Jan-19 09:39 AM] Vilenarios#8742
50 AR in the past month seems waaaay too low.


[02-Jan-19 09:40 AM] tierralibre#2740
yup that's what I think too


[02-Jan-19 09:40 AM] tierralibre#2740
https://arweave.erm.earth


[02-Jan-19 09:40 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I’ll set my cloud miner to a dedicated wallet so I can track specifically what I get


[02-Jan-19 09:40 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Instead of just looking at logs


[02-Jan-19 09:40 AM] tierralibre#2740
yup, same


[02-Jan-19 09:42 AM] tierralibre#2740
and I have been using that node to archive myself too


[02-Jan-19 09:42 AM] tierralibre#2740
so I was paying the weave to archive


[02-Jan-19 09:48 AM] tiamat#9131
@Vilenarios 4 cpu you mean 4x CPU or 4 cores or 4 threads?


[02-Jan-19 09:48 AM] Vilenarios#8742
You used or own node to archive does that mean you got your own fees?


[02-Jan-19 09:48 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I mean 4 threads, max_miner 3


[02-Jan-19 09:48 AM] tiamat#9131
isnt 150 usd a bit too much for that?


[02-Jan-19 09:49 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Uhhh fuck yeah it is - it’s Azure though


[02-Jan-19 09:49 AM] tiamat#9131
I run 32 threads for less than that


[02-Jan-19 09:50 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Where at?


[02-Jan-19 09:50 AM] tiamat#9131
and I get at least 5 blocks/day


[02-Jan-19 09:51 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I got a Microsoft developer network subscription so that gives me free Azure dollars per month. Only reason I use it.


[02-Jan-19 09:58 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Would love to know what cloud hosting company gives 32 threads for less than 150 a month cuz that’s sooo cheap.


[02-Jan-19 09:59 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Going by my math that would make your breakeven around 3 cents per AR.


[02-Jan-19 10:12 AM] tiamat#9131
sorry, I was speaking about dedicated server not cloud


[02-Jan-19 10:19 AM] tiamat#9131
once we'll list on exchanges, mining will be over for us, Asians have thousands of servers, if it's profitable they jump in immediately


[02-Jan-19 10:20 AM] tierralibre#2740
This is a bare metal dedicated server on the cloud


[02-Jan-19 10:21 AM] tiamat#9131
it probably has weak or not dedicated cpu if you mined only 50 AR


[02-Jan-19 10:21 AM] tierralibre#2740
I will measure it. Thank you!


[02-Jan-19 10:21 AM] tiamat#9131
even my 2 core atom does better


[02-Jan-19 10:22 AM] Vilenarios#8742
@tiamat don’t ruin my hopes and dreams with Chinese miner overload


[02-Jan-19 10:22 AM] Vilenarios#8742
 


[02-Jan-19 10:23 AM] Vilenarios#8742
https://chronobot.io/arweave/ shows only a few Chinese miners now.


[02-Jan-19 10:23 AM] Vilenarios#8742
But who knows who is using polling.


[02-Jan-19 10:23 AM] tiamat#9131
@Vilenarios I have seen other projects, they can run thousands of miners in a couple of days if it's profitable


[02-Jan-19 10:24 AM] tiamat#9131
I think they operate EU and US servers/IPs


[02-Jan-19 10:25 AM] Vilenarios#8742
You think those miners have lots of disk though? Granted with the blockweave size now it won’t matter.


[02-Jan-19 10:26 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Either way they got more resources than little ol me


[02-Jan-19 10:26 AM] tiamat#9131
One example is our viewblock sister project Zilliqa , no rewards for testnet but thousands of miners, when mainnet will launch it will be crazy


[02-Jan-19 11:08 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@tiamat Are we in testnet?


[02-Jan-19 11:38 AM] Vilenarios#8742
No we are in production with real rewards


[02-Jan-19 11:39 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I would think them Chinese miners would want to jump on it now to reap the most rewards...


[02-Jan-19 12:08 PM] Marcin#0065
We need strong miners too, to have a solid network. 
Ofc not only and not few, the idea of ddcentralosation should still be important


[02-Jan-19 12:09 PM] Mason Black#0187
It should be priority #1


[02-Jan-19 09:26 PM] ivhturp#3325
@arweave-lev How are the rewards calculated. I remember them being 7AR per block last month. Now its 34AR.


[02-Jan-19 09:27 PM] ivhturp#3325
Is there any command to purge invalid blocks?


[03-Jan-19 03:09 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@ivhturp they were indeed around 7 AR a month ago. A formula is here - https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/blob/N.1.6.0.0/src/ar_inflation.erl#L33

[03-Jan-19 03:29 AM] arweave-lev#3466
We delayed the rewards to ensure smoother onboarding of miners so later they caused a spike in the graph, but from now on the rewards will only be decreasing.


[03-Jan-19 03:30 AM] ivhturp#3325
Ah,  have these inflated rewards start from 1.6.0.0?


[03-Jan-19 03:44 AM] arweave-lev#3466
The formula was updated in 1.5.0.0


[03-Jan-19 04:32 AM] arweave-martin#1169
And then there are also the transaction rewards which will be increasing with the usage.


[03-Jan-19 12:08 PM] JW#2445
Hi all,


[03-Jan-19 12:08 PM] JW#2445
I would like to start ming via powershell. Does anybody have the script to use?


[03-Jan-19 12:08 PM] JW#2445
Thnx in advance!


[03-Jan-19 12:09 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Hey @JW I haven’t been able to figure this out either


[03-Jan-19 12:09 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Need to call Bash from power shell first


[03-Jan-19 12:09 PM] Vilenarios#8742
But then idk how you can pipe in the command to start the miner


[03-Jan-19 12:10 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I also tried Chronjobs in WSL Ubuntu as well but they didn’t work


[03-Jan-19 12:10 PM] Vilenarios#8742
So basically, if ur on a Windows box there is no way to auto start the miner on a reboot or something. At least not that I’ve figured out.


[03-Jan-19 12:11 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Also i found that I can only kill WSL processes through WSL itself


[03-Jan-19 12:11 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Like if you wanted to terminate Beam it has to be through WSL.


[03-Jan-19 12:12 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Pkill beam.smp


[03-Jan-19 12:12 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Someone with better WSL knowledge may know a better way to automate it.

I’m a Microsoft guy but Ubuntu was just as easy to get running and is a lot more stable


[03-Jan-19 12:15 PM] JW#2445
No I already got my ubuntu already start mining

is it possible to mine it on vps? like digital ocean/ aws?


[04-Jan-19 06:47 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@aurora why not?


[04-Jan-19 06:48 AM] aurora#3501
what does mining depend on ram or diskspace or processing speed?


[04-Jan-19 06:53 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@aurora right now only CPU


[04-Jan-19 06:55 AM] aurora#3501
are there any estimates how much cpu leads to how much blocks per day ?


[04-Jan-19 07:41 AM] tiamat#9131
you need fast connection + fast cpu


[04-Jan-19 07:41 AM] tiamat#9131
but you can't mine without enough space, so careful what vps plan you choose


[04-Jan-19 09:17 AM] JW#2445

@! [[$0m€B0dy you haven’t joined the network. What are you seeing in the log file?


[04-Jan-19 09:38 PM] Vilenarios#8742
When you mine a block you won’t see it as a transaction


[04-Jan-19 09:38 PM] Vilenarios#8742
But you should be able to see the mined block and your wallet address in the Blocks page on Viewblock explorer.


[04-Jan-19 11:59 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
And where can I see all the transactions?

Can anyone recommend a free, simple network load balancer?


[05-Jan-19 04:00 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Trying to add more nodes but don’t want to do polling... I shouldn’t suffer any wildfire penalties putting my machines behind a load balancer with single public IP right @arweave-sam ?


[05-Jan-19 05:45 PM] tierralibre#2740
@Vilenarios I use Caddy for providing HTTPS and proxying. You can compile from source and then use it how you want. The proxy settings I think can do load balancing but have not tried that.


[05-Jan-19 09:22 PM] Vilenarios#8742
thanks @tierralibre ill check it out

To get your own hashrate run ./arweave-server benchmark


[06-Jan-19 07:33 AM] Vilenarios#8742
That is just raw cpu hashing and doesn’t take into account your disk and network performance.

@Vilenarios thank you


[06-Jan-19 07:49 AM] ! [[$0m€B0dy#0101
And network hashrzte?


[06-Jan-19 07:49 AM] Vilenarios#8742
If you browse to your own IP and http://myip:1984/info


[06-Jan-19 07:49 AM] Vilenarios#8742
It will tel you your network latency


[06-Jan-19 07:50 AM] Vilenarios#8742
that and running a local network speed test to your ISP is the only way to gauge your network capacity.


[06-Jan-19 07:51 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Googling “test my speed” is good enough for a quick check. Idk how to quickly do this on a GUI-less Ubuntu though. B


[06-Jan-19 08:42 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
speedtest-cli is good for me and my Ubuntu LTS


[06-Jan-19 02:01 PM] arweave-martin#1169
@Vilenarios Are you referring to "node_state_latency"? node_state_latency is the latency in microseconds when fetching something from the state storage inside the arweave server. It has nothing to do with network since it's completely internal. I guess the name is not very clear.


[06-Jan-19 02:17 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Wow thank you so much @arweave-martin that has been a big misconception of mine. Idk why I thought it was network related.


[07-Jan-19 12:09 AM] taariq#2485
@arweave-martin 

Thanks, also thought it's network. 
I'm checking it every 10 seconds to have an hourly average and median, since it fluctuates wildly. Do these numbers look reasonable or can I look at storage or elsewhere for improvements?

eg
last_latency=52, average_latency=2190, median_latency=172

Anyone else experiencing issues mining. My last block was days ago. Infra looks fine. Anyone can give some pointers? Does restarting the server helps?


[07-Jan-19 03:18 AM] taariq#2485
Yes you may need to restart, sometimes I get a network error, network is fine but restarting arweave fixes it.


[07-Jan-19 08:36 AM] Marcin#0065
@JW same here


[07-Jan-19 09:28 AM] JW#2445
I have restarted the server, but I doubt if something will change


[07-Jan-19 11:23 AM] Vilenarios#8742
No issues with my miners.


[07-Jan-19 11:23 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Actually found a pretty cheap dell server I may buy to bump my hashrate.


[07-Jan-19 11:24 AM] Vilenarios#8742
If I only had a place I could sell my AR to recoup my miner expenses...


[07-Jan-19 12:49 PM] ivhturp#3325
Has anyone ever used or got reply from OTC desk of base58?


[07-Jan-19 12:51 PM] ivhturp#3325
@Vilenarios Looks like everyone is facing liquidity issues! Hopefully we get a listing soon 🤞


[07-Jan-19 02:14 PM] JW#2445
@Vilenarios what hardware does the dell contain? I am also looking for one


[07-Jan-19 02:37 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Well the one I found (Dell R620) has got a pair of Xeon E5-2760v2 which is 10core/20threads. Maybe I’ll do 16Gb ram. And only a single TB drive for now.


[07-Jan-19 02:47 PM] Vilenarios#8742
My biggest problem is network. Single IP is a bottleneck. And I kinda don’t wanna start asking family and friends to keep servers at their house.


[07-Jan-19 02:47 PM] JW#2445
Those are nice processors!


[07-Jan-19 02:48 PM] JW#2445
Yeah I have got the same issue. I am keeping my operation small.


[07-Jan-19 02:48 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I would hope they perform well. I think the price to hash ratio is better for older procs like that vs like a new i9-9980xe or something.


[07-Jan-19 02:49 PM] JW#2445
I don’t want to lease servers. I am keeping it all in the cellar:-)


[07-Jan-19 02:49 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Yup me too. I need to plaster an Arweave logo on my utility closet since it’s turning into an AR datcenter lol


[07-Jan-19 02:49 PM] JW#2445

Cool!


[07-Jan-19 02:50 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Gpu miner also mines AR of course   rarely finds a block though. Maybe once every few days.


[07-Jan-19 02:50 PM] JW#2445
So which coins/tokens you are mining now ?


[07-Jan-19 02:50 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I’ve been lazy with GpU mining so I’ve been using nicehash mostly.


[07-Jan-19 02:51 PM] Vilenarios#8742
But I just got Beam miner/node up and running so I’ll try that I think


[07-Jan-19 02:51 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Hard for me to mine multiple speculative coins with 0 exchange. I’ve gotten burned that way already.


[07-Jan-19 02:52 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Also pretty sure I’m losing money keeping the miner up right now, but it should breakeven soon if ETH keeps climbing.


[07-Jan-19 02:52 PM] JW#2445
I am doing AR and NKN and I just get rid off Darkcoin


[07-Jan-19 02:52 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I’ve heard NKN but haven’t researched it at all. Heard there were lots of miners already.

Ya my gpu miner is windows but I’m thinking of switching as well.


[07-Jan-19 02:55 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Seems like all the new coins do linux first anyway

Never heard of beam by the way

@Vilenarios I am mining on Dell R 430 with 2 xeon E5-2630 - total of 16C/32T + 32GB RAM and decent network speed. It is barely mining a block per day.


[07-Jan-19 11:01 PM] ivhturp#3325
Btw is NKN mining  CPU based or GPU?


[08-Jan-19 01:29 AM] Roman#2713
@ivhturp I would say NKN is IP-based.
You need only dedicated IPv4 at least 0.5G RAM (1G for better stability) and any CPU. But if your node will be cost more then couple bucks per month you will be losing you money.

Welcome to PoW :) same for me ;)


[08-Jan-19 07:17 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Difficulty has been 32 and 33... yet seems much harder to find blocks indeed.


[09-Jan-19 12:03 AM] ivhturp#3325
@Roman thanks buddy
@Vilenarios I got 5 or 6 blocks in 4 days! 
Isnt difficulty between 31 to 33 from long time?


[09-Jan-19 04:15 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Yeah difficulty has been low. I mined a few last night.


[09-Jan-19 04:16 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I stop:start my miner basically every time I check it


[09-Jan-19 04:16 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Idk why but it just seems like it helps me with finding blocks.


[09-Jan-19 04:23 AM] Dentechr#5213
I also got about 1.5 blocks a day. But on top of that you receive additional rewards which you are unable to see as i am aware.
It seems my miner get stuck in connection lost after about a day or 4 and fails to reconnect on its own.
So i have to check it and reboot it.
Anybody else experiences this ?

[09-Jan-19 05:45 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
That's why it's important to download your json key file and store it offline in multiple places @Gai. With the Arweave web extension, you download a copy of your key file when you create your wallet and if you choose to do so, you can then remove your wallet from the web browser and uninstall the web extension once you've stored your key file in multiple places.


[09-Jan-19 06:31 AM] Marcin#0065
Since we have almost big miners only, how do you plan to make Arweave attractive to the people to even THINK of setting up a miner? Not talking about profitability... but the whole idea of decentralisation is already gone. We do not have a decentralised mining amoung those 120+ nodes. 
Its also not attractive to potential users, to know, the data is not spread well, its just in one of those few mining servers. 
I really hoped a good connection and disk space would be more important, as proclaimed back in the early days

@tiamat I keep syncing across nodes for backup. Just want to remove unnecessary data or files


[18-Jan-19 05:54 PM] Vilenarios#8742
So we got like 200 nodes on viewblock but the difficulty is 32. Shouldn’t it be higher?


[18-Jan-19 05:54 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Or is it the lower the difficulty the harder it is to mine?


[19-Jan-19 01:27 AM] Marcin#0065
The difficulty was below 30 when mining has begun back then


[19-Jan-19 03:08 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@Vilenarios  the higher the difficulty, the harder it is to mine. Sometimes it reaches 33. Note that a change in difficulty from N to N + 1 makes it twice as hard to mine a block .


[19-Jan-19 04:50 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Thanks Lev. I would think difficulty would be at its highest since our node count is around 200. But I guess node count != higher hashrate


[19-Jan-19 05:53 AM] Marcin#0065

Anybody having using AWS? My setup constantly changing its IP and for some reason the mining stops regularly


[19-Jan-19 09:23 PM] ivhturp#3325
@awkweird You can go for elastic IP if you want static IP. Anyways, change in IP shouldnt create issue with miner. Can you paste the logs?


[19-Jan-19 10:06 PM] awkweird#6550
Did the elastic ip but it doesn’t work as static ip


[19-Jan-19 10:06 PM] awkweird#6550
Also, the logs are gone when i tmux attach back to the server


[19-Jan-19 10:07 PM] awkweird#6550
So it is basically hit or miss on the aws for me


[20-Jan-19 03:14 AM] ivhturp#3325
Elastic ip works as static. Anyways you can check logs in arweave/logs folder or you can run `make log` inside arweave folder


[20-Jan-19 07:47 AM] awkweird#6550
@ivhturp thanks for the advise, i have actually set it as elastic ip


[20-Jan-19 07:48 AM] awkweird#6550
For the “make log” it disappears when the instance restarts


[20-Jan-19 07:49 AM] awkweird#6550
Not sure if all the logs saved separately somewhere


[20-Jan-19 11:10 AM] ivhturp#3325
You will find see several log files in areeave/logs folder

Yup, was thinking the same. Will share in some time bro

@ivhturp I will probably be selling all of my AR upon listing


[21-Jan-19 05:09 AM] Vilenarios#8742
The question is, who will be buying


[21-Jan-19 05:13 AM] tiamat#9131
no bulls, no buyers, unless it drops ridiculously low to like 10%


[21-Jan-19 05:32 AM] ivhturp#3325
@Vilenarios same with me bro
@tiamat Token sale to strategic investors last year was 0.09€ and public sale was 0.55€. Given that ETH has come down by 80% from public sale, I highly doubt it will hold 10% of 0.55€


[21-Jan-19 05:35 AM] ivhturp#3325
Looks like it is quite risky to mine anymore. I am liquidating my existing portfolio to support mining costs

[21-Jan-19 05:55 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@awkweird @ivhturp Good to know is that the Wildfire score is based on the IP address. When you change IP address, all other nodes will see your node as a new one. This will basically reset your Wildfire scores.


[21-Jan-19 06:01 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Is there a “maximum” wildfire score?


[21-Jan-19 06:10 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@Vilenarios  I don't know for sure,  but I'm guessing no because that doesn't make sense to me. Keep in mind that every node peering with your node will keep its own score for your node. The absolute value of your score doesn't matter. If your node has the best score, then a higher score wont make a difference.


[21-Jan-19 06:21 AM] ivhturp#3325
How do i check wildfire score of my nodes. And what impact can it have on candidate blocks that are produced?

Is it less probable for a candidate block of a new node to be accepted?


[21-Jan-19 06:36 AM] Vilenarios#8742
All my candidate blocks are always accepted unless it’s a polling node.


[21-Jan-19 06:36 AM] awkweird#6550
The IP got static but the instance often restarts and need to do the work all over again. Any specific configuration for setting the miner in aws?


[21-Jan-19 06:44 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@ivhturp The nodes don't expose the score of their peers, so you cannot see what scores your node has on the network. You can read about how Wildfire works in the Lightpaper https://www.arweave.org/files/arweave-lightpaper.pdf


[21-Jan-19 06:49 AM] arweave-martin#1169
The point of Wildfire is to incentivise providing other nodes with data quickly (including fast propagation of new blocks). If your node is a good citizen distributing data quickly to the network, then other nodes will distribute data quickly to your node. The quicker you get new blocks, the less time your miner is spending on mining on the wrong block.


[21-Jan-19 06:49 AM] arweave-martin#1169
Read more about it in the Lightpaper.


[21-Jan-19 08:24 AM] chriscord#4741
Does it still make sense to use the max_miners option? In what scenarios is it useful?


[21-Jan-19 08:24 AM] Vilenarios#8742
All scenarios I think


[21-Jan-19 08:24 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Sure for mining blocks you want all cpus


[21-Jan-19 08:25 AM] Vilenarios#8742
But AR is also about serving content. If your CPUs are all maxed out you gonna have a slow response to the other nodes.


[21-Jan-19 08:25 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I’ve found for Linux it’s good to keep 2 cores available


[21-Jan-19 08:26 AM] Vilenarios#8742
The max_miners works very funky in Windows Subsytem for Linux though and it’s hit or miss.


[21-Jan-19 08:26 AM] chriscord#4741
Got it. So max out as much as possible for mining. But reserve some compute for communicating with the network


[21-Jan-19 08:28 AM] chriscord#4741
Thanks @Vilenarios


[22-Jan-19 12:45 AM] ivhturp#3325
@Vilenarios at this moment, there is no data to serve. At the best, serving blocks or peer info is the only communication that is happening AFAIK.  So i feel leaving even 1 core is more than enough. However I had issues on one server where i had to leave around 10% cores approx. Its more of fine tuning  


[22-Jan-19 01:26 AM] chriscord#4741
@ivhturp what did you tune for? That is were you trying to optimize for node latency or something else?


[22-Jan-19 03:58 AM] Dentechr#5213
You could start with a high number of miner cores and check you avarge latency. You will notice a point where the laten y stops dropping and stays the same.


[22-Jan-19 03:59 AM] Dentechr#5213
On my rig i found the best latency was if i put max miners on 23 out of 32 cores


[22-Jan-19 06:56 AM] chriscord#4741
Ok will do. Thanks @Dentechr


[24-Jan-19 03:27 AM] polygravity_bastian#0358
Hello @all, I am currently trying to mine but all I get is the message "could not start mining"... Does anybody has any hints for me?


[24-Jan-19 03:29 AM] Marcin#0065
Do you have the recall blocks?


[24-Jan-19 03:31 AM] Marcin#0065
To start to mine, a randonly chosen block of all existing is blocks is the recall block. You need to have that block on ur disk, to "qualify" for mining.


[24-Jan-19 03:31 AM] Marcin#0065
The more blocks you own, the more ofteb your machine is mining


[24-Jan-19 03:31 AM] polygravity_bastian#0358
How can I check this?


[24-Jan-19 03:31 AM] Marcin#0065
Check in browser


[24-Jan-19 03:32 AM] Marcin#0065
Check your ip adress


[24-Jan-19 03:32 AM] Marcin#0065
Remembed to port forward port 1984


[24-Jan-19 03:33 AM] polygravity_bastian#0358
Yes portforwarding is verified


[24-Jan-19 03:36 AM] polygravity_bastian#0358
So if I check the URL i get the infos... how can I check if I have the recall block?


[24-Jan-19 03:36 AM] Marcin#0065
If you are on the same machine, try in browser 127.0.0.1


[24-Jan-19 03:37 AM] Marcin#0065
Or: <your ip adress>:1984


[24-Jan-19 03:37 AM] Marcin#0065
It will show u sone numbers


[24-Jan-19 03:37 AM] Marcin#0065
Or manually go to the folder and see how many blocks are in there ;)


[24-Jan-19 03:38 AM] polygravity_bastian#0358
ok so "blocks" is the number of stored blocks on my maschine? and "height" is the current value of all blocks?


[24-Jan-19 03:41 AM] polygravity_bastian#0358
How long does it take to have all blocks on my disk?


[24-Jan-19 04:08 AM] Marcin#0065
Heigh is the current block heigh of the machine


[24-Jan-19 04:09 AM] Marcin#0065
And blocks is the total number of blocks


[24-Jan-19 04:09 AM] Marcin#0065
But its possible to have some false blocks, so the number aint exact


[24-Jan-19 04:09 AM] Marcin#0065
I dont know how long it takes, but ill guess around some days by now?


[24-Jan-19 04:11 AM] polygravity_bastian#0358
Ok so I will wait a few days more


[24-Jan-19 05:09 PM] awkweird#6550
Anybody having problem with start mining on AWS? My machine downloads the last 100 blocks then the instance stops instantly for no reason.


[24-Jan-19 08:19 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I use Azure and not AWS and have no problems.


[24-Jan-19 08:19 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I thought I saw others here using AWS as well with no issues.


[24-Jan-19 08:20 PM] Vilenarios#8742
U got a static IP? Port forwarding? Enough disk space?


[24-Jan-19 08:48 PM] ivhturp#3325
Do you mean miner program stops or ec2 instance ? I am running on aws without any issues


[24-Jan-19 11:22 PM] awkweird#6550
Really, thats odd


[24-Jan-19 11:22 PM] awkweird#6550
Maybe i should charge my card with more money


[24-Jan-19 11:23 PM] awkweird#6550
@ivhturp yes the instance stops somehow


[24-Jan-19 11:24 PM] awkweird#6550
When i checked the status on aws console, it says “stopped”


[24-Jan-19 11:25 PM] awkweird#6550

@awkweird Which EC2 instance type is it?


[25-Jan-19 04:21 AM] awkweird#6550
Is c4.4xlarge IIRC, its been like this for like 10days and more


[25-Jan-19 04:22 AM] awkweird#6550
Should terminate my contract and turn my pc on in my home


[25-Jan-19 04:22 AM] awkweird#6550
Cannot afford AWS lol


[25-Jan-19 11:10 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Ya I dont think cloud mining is profitable... unless ur doing 3 year contract or something.


[26-Jan-19 11:21 AM] ivhturp#3325
@awkweird Check if you are using high value for max_miners. Perhaps instance is shutdown bcos of high load. Without logs, its hard to understand


[26-Jan-19 11:21 AM] ivhturp#3325
I use c5 with no issues.


[26-Jan-19 08:01 PM] awkweird#6550
@ivhturp yea, I was using 12 of 16 cores as max miners. However I've decided not to mine more. Terminated yesterday  


[27-Jan-19 03:35 AM] ivhturp#3325
I also plan to soon 😑

Yes, this one was ~250 commits @arweave-martin ?


[29-Jan-19 10:23 AM] Vilenarios#8742
It will allow multiple miners behind a single IP


[29-Jan-19 10:23 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Aka no more polling


[29-Jan-19 10:24 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Right?


[29-Jan-19 10:24 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@slayer_hellraiser You can run the miner on a different port than 1984. But it's not backwards compatible with the previous release, so wait a bit until more nodes have upgraded before you try it out.


[29-Jan-19 10:25 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@Vilenarios That's right. No more polling mode needed  


[29-Jan-19 10:25 AM] arweave-martin#1169
The forwarded port on you Internet IP address must still match the port you start the miner or.


[29-Jan-19 10:25 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-martin And it gives nothing more?


[29-Jan-19 10:26 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@slayer_hellraiser That's the port feature, yes. It's actually a big deal because using polling mode and not being able to choose whatever port you want is quite painful.

[30-Jan-19 03:21 AM] prk#3209
Are you mining on your lap?


[30-Jan-19 03:21 AM] polygravity_bastian#0358
I will use the time to update the server to the new release


[30-Jan-19 03:22 AM] polygravity_bastian#0358
@prk I am mining with two devices... One server with 16 Cores and my lap with 12 cores (just for testing because no rewards on the server). But at all, no rewards


[30-Jan-19 06:10 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Hey @polygravity_bastian did you set up port forwarding on your router?


[30-Jan-19 06:10 AM] Vilenarios#8742
With the latest updates you can set up different ports per miner. So for example your main miner can use port 1984 and secondary can use port 1985 or something. But you need to make sure your router appropriately forwards these n


[30-Jan-19 06:11 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Also are you using max_miner parameter? This will limit your CPU usage. It’s not recommended to use every core you have.


[30-Jan-19 06:11 AM] Vilenarios#8742
So for example a 16 core machine could maybe use max_miners 12 to start with


[30-Jan-19 06:17 AM] tiamat#9131
something must be wrong in the setup, 12 corres / 1 week should definitely produce rewards


[30-Jan-19 06:19 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I agree. My 4 core cloud miner with max_miner 3 produces on average a block a day.


[30-Jan-19 06:20 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Another thing to ensure is that your public IP is relatively static. If it’s changing often then that will reduce your wildfire score. Which worsens the chance of your block being accepted by the network.


[30-Jan-19 06:20 AM] Vilenarios#8742
But if you aren’t even finding blocks at all, then that’s a different issue.


[30-Jan-19 06:23 AM] polygravity_bastian#0358
Hey @Vilenarios port forwording is working. max-miners is set to 12 out of 16. I also get the message "[Stage 1/3] Successfully proved access to recall block. Starting to hash." and all 12 core are going up to 100%. But thats all


[30-Jan-19 06:23 AM] polygravity_bastian#0358
And my IP is a static one


[30-Jan-19 06:24 AM] polygravity_bastian#0358
I have no idea what the issue could be


[30-Jan-19 06:25 AM] Vilenarios#8742
How many blocks do you have? Have you downloaded the whole chain yet?


[30-Jan-19 06:25 AM] polygravity_bastian#0358
no i have 85.000 blocks now


[30-Jan-19 06:29 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Hmmm. That may be impacting but still I would expect you to find at least something


[30-Jan-19 06:30 AM] polygravity_bastian#0358
I think the number of blocks is just important for you to be allowed to mine


[30-Jan-19 06:31 AM] polygravity_bastian#0358
So if I have the recall block I am allowed to mine and could find a block


[30-Jan-19 06:31 AM] polygravity_bastian#0358
Or am I wrong?


[30-Jan-19 06:34 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Nope ur definitely right


[30-Jan-19 06:35 AM] polygravity_bastian#0358
hmmm


[30-Jan-19 06:35 AM] Vilenarios#8742
What kind of cpu u running?


[30-Jan-19 06:35 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I have a theory that older cpus are exponentially worse than newer ones


[30-Jan-19 06:36 AM] polygravity_bastian#0358
Yes thats true, but 800kh/s are 800kh/s


[30-Jan-19 06:37 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Yes and no - it doesn’t add up all your cores into a combined hashrate


[30-Jan-19 06:37 AM] Vilenarios#8742
It’s like ur running a race


[30-Jan-19 06:37 AM] Vilenarios#8742
And you put in 10 slow runners.


[30-Jan-19 06:37 AM] Vilenarios#8742
The one fast runner is almost always gonna win


[30-Jan-19 06:37 AM] polygravity_bastian#0358
So i use 12 times 800kh/s on the one maschine and 10 times 1200kh/s on another one


[30-Jan-19 06:37 AM] Vilenarios#8742
There is no second or third place.


[30-Jan-19 06:37 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Either way - I’d think you would find something


[30-Jan-19 06:37 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Especially on the 1200kh/s one


[30-Jan-19 06:38 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Sorry I can’t help more  


[30-Jan-19 06:38 AM] polygravity_bastian#0358
Yes thanks a lot  


[30-Jan-19 06:40 AM] Vilenarios#8742
U aren’t using polling right?


[30-Jan-19 06:44 AM] polygravity_bastian#0358
no


[30-Jan-19 07:31 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@Vilenarios It's all about how many hashes your miner can try out per second. The higher hashrate, the more rewards. 4 cores with 500kh/s each is equal to 2 cores with 1000kh/s each.


[30-Jan-19 07:33 AM] arweave-martin#1169
There are some overhead as well, but basically doubling the number of cores should give you rewards twice as often.


[30-Jan-19 07:34 AM] polygravity_bastian#0358
@arweave-martin so do you have any idea what should be the problem?


[30-Jan-19 07:52 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@polygravity_bastian Did you use the Arweave wallet (the chrome extension) to check your balance or how do find your rewards?


[30-Jan-19 07:53 AM] polygravity_bastian#0358
tried the extension and the URL command


[30-Jan-19 07:54 AM] polygravity_bastian#0358
and I think that there has to be a log like "[Stage 3/3]..."


[30-Jan-19 09:24 AM] Vilenarios#8742

[30-Jan-19 11:11 AM] Marcin#0065
Whats the relation between 1 core and 1 core with 2 threads?


[30-Jan-19 11:12 AM] tiamat#9131
they are seen by erlang as different vcpus


[30-Jan-19 11:12 AM] Marcin#0065
The benchmark on my pc loads one thread only


[30-Jan-19 11:13 AM] Marcin#0065
So the benchmark gives a thread score, not cpu core score?


[30-Jan-19 11:13 AM] tiamat#9131
a 4core intel with 2 hyperthreads would be seen as 8 vcpus


[30-Jan-19 11:14 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yes, Erlang will start a separate process 'scheduler' for each thread


[30-Jan-19 11:14 AM] Marcin#0065
How about a full 100% socket loead? Is it possible? Way easier to compare efficeny


[30-Jan-19 11:14 AM] Marcin#0065
No matter what cpu is built in


[30-Jan-19 11:15 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I think @arweave-martin was working on modifying the benchmarker a few days ago


[30-Jan-19 11:15 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Not sure where he got to with that


[30-Jan-19 11:16 AM] Marcin#0065
Leave him with important stuff :D


[30-Jan-19 11:16 AM] Marcin#0065
Dont bother about tge benchmark


[30-Jan-19 11:17 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We actually needed it for some other important stuff we were modifying  


[30-Jan-19 11:17 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Having better benchmarks helps us check the effect of the changes that we make to the miner


[30-Jan-19 11:19 AM] tiamat#9131
I hope you migrate to Proof of Capacity or some kind of PoS


[30-Jan-19 11:19 AM] Marcin#0065
Maybe an overall benchmark too? Like disk speed and internet connection larency? In the beginning of the project, i remember, you were all talming about rewards scaled to disk space and connection. But atm its pure pow.


[30-Jan-19 11:20 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@tiamat It will likely be a genprog + PoC hybrid


[30-Jan-19 11:20 AM] arweave-sam#9630
It stretches as network performance changes @Marcin


[30-Jan-19 11:20 AM] arweave-sam#9630
If the network was highly stressed again, those factors would play more of a role


[30-Jan-19 11:22 AM] tiamat#9131
Someone from Quarkchain had some nice articles, one  about a hybrid where you get 10x hashrate if you stake


[30-Jan-19 11:23 AM] tiamat#9131
and one about Hashpower reuse


[30-Jan-19 11:23 AM] tiamat#9131
Hashpower reuse technique

A key observation from this list is that BTC/ETH has very strong hashpower but with lower number of transactions per second. Is it possible that new blockchains could reuse the hashpower of BTC/ETH to prevent double-spending attacks, like code reuse in software development? One possible solution is to use sidechains, where the block producers (BP) of the sidechain periodically submit their chain snapshot to the mainchain (BTC/ETH). However, the consensus of the mainchain is not aware of the underlying sidechain consensus, and thus if different views are created in the sidechain, i.e., forks, the sidechain has to decide the correct view by the sidechain’s own consensus algorithm, which weakens the security model.


[30-Jan-19 11:25 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Thanks @tiamat, very interesting


[31-Jan-19 02:01 AM] prk#3209
Could not start mining
Stored recall block for foreign verification


[31-Jan-19 02:02 AM] prk#3209
Any solution?^^

[31-Jan-19 02:09 AM] ATLAS#7218

[31-Jan-19 02:11 AM] prk#3209
Ok


[31-Jan-19 02:12 AM] prk#3209
So how much time does it take to start mining now


[31-Jan-19 02:14 AM] Marcin#0065
Over 300 nodes already. Slightly growing :)


[31-Jan-19 02:15 AM] Marcin#0065
@prk the more blocks you have on your hdd, the more often you can mine


[31-Jan-19 02:15 AM] Marcin#0065
I guess it takes some time to download all blocks. Maybe days?


[31-Jan-19 02:17 AM] prk#3209
Downloading all the blocks is necessary?


[31-Jan-19 02:25 AM] Marcin#0065
No, but it gives higher chances


[31-Jan-19 02:25 AM] Marcin#0065
Read about "recall blocks"


[31-Jan-19 02:26 AM] Marcin#0065
A randon block of all mined blocks is chosen, the recall block. If you own the recall block, you are qualified ti start hashing


[31-Jan-19 02:26 AM] Marcin#0065
With every new block a new random recall block is chosen


[31-Jan-19 03:00 AM] prk#3209
It's showing some list of blocks in the folder


[31-Jan-19 05:20 AM] ATLAS#7218
To put it simply, if you have *M* blocks out of total *N* blocks, you will have *M/N* probability to start competing for the next block. For people who just started, *M << N* so its very unlikely to be eligible to mine the next block.


[31-Jan-19 07:16 AM] arweave-martin#1169
I think a better metric for the size of the network would how many nodes are on the main fork. Currently it's 135.


[31-Jan-19 07:16 AM] arweave-martin#1169
That's the metric I've posted a few times before in this channel


[31-Jan-19 08:54 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I would agree - node count is the best metric


[31-Jan-19 08:56 AM] Vilenarios#8742
would be cool if i could also see how many times my node is being hit for reads of data


[31-Jan-19 08:56 AM] Vilenarios#8742
or some of the other typical web KPIs


[31-Jan-19 08:56 AM] Vilenarios#8742
since we are web servers after all  


[31-Jan-19 08:57 AM] Vilenarios#8742
total network hashrate would also be nice on top of data size and transactions


[31-Jan-19 09:21 AM] arweave-sam#9630
That already exists @Vilenarios


[31-Jan-19 09:21 AM] arweave-sam#9630
It is exposed through `GET /metrics`, I beleive


[31-Jan-19 09:22 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You *can* load those metrics into Grafana


[31-Jan-19 09:22 AM] arweave-sam#9630
But I am afraid I don't recall the details


[31-Jan-19 09:25 AM] Vilenarios#8742

[31-Jan-19 09:26 AM] Vilenarios#8742
is this data from a certain time period?


[31-Jan-19 09:26 AM] Vilenarios#8742
or just for the session that the miner has been online?


[31-Jan-19 09:27 AM] Vilenarios#8742

that doesnt seem good... getting that on my cloud miner, but on prems have no failed requests at all


[31-Jan-19 09:29 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Interesting


[31-Jan-19 09:30 AM] arweave-sam#9630
It is fairly normal for there to be some `request_closed`s

Hey can i add peers after the mining  program is started? I want to add on the fly without restarting the program


[31-Jan-19 10:35 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@ivhturp I think you should be able to run something like the following...

`ar_node:add_peers(whereis(http_entrypoint_node), ar_util:parse("IP_ADDRESS_HERE")).<ENTER>`


[31-Jan-19 10:35 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Does that look about right @arweave-martin ?


[31-Jan-19 10:44 AM] arweave-lev#3466
This should do the trick:

ar_bridge:add_remote_peer(whereis(http_bridge_node), ar_util:parse_peer("IP")).


[31-Jan-19 10:44 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Ah yes


[31-Jan-19 10:44 AM] arweave-sam#9630
`ar_bridge` not `ar_node`  


[31-Jan-19 12:11 PM] ivhturp#3325
Wow, thanks for the help @arweave-sam @arweave-lev 
I believe this is to be entered on the erlang console that is shown after the arweave server is started. I need to figure out how to do from bash. 
`Use case I am trying to solve` I have several nodes with dynamic IPs. I am trying to update new nodes as Peers in existing nodes. It is definitely simple with static IPs though!
One more question: If peer `x` (which is not reachable at the moment) is listed as peer when the arweave server is invoked, will it be removed from the peer list? What are the conditions by which peers are updated. I wish I knew erlang to understand in detail

@ivhturp there is an HTTP endpoint that might help to automate this process - https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/blob/master/src/ar_http_iface_server.erl#L425. Unfortunately, it's not documented. Anyway, it's easy to use. From the node with a new dynamic IP, make `POST /peers` HTTP requests to the nodes you want to peer with. The body should contain the network name, like this: `{"network":"arweave.N.1"}` .  An example using curl: `curl -X POST -d '{"network":"arweave.N.1"}' http://127.0.0.1:1984/peers`.

Yet difficulty is still 33


[01-Feb-19 11:18 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I guess all these nodes have pentium cpus or something


[01-Feb-19 09:06 PM] Vilenarios#8742
So how come node count is clearly going up but difficulty stays the same? Not that I’m complaining... I would just think they go up hand in hand.


[01-Feb-19 10:37 PM] ivhturp#3325
Exactly my doubt @Vilenarios. Is viewblock now counting nodes which were polling post last release? @arweave-martin

@slayer_hellraiser ah yes, probably the most importnt stat.  It was around $140 over that time period.


[02-Feb-19 01:41 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@Vilenarios 140 bucks per month? Or more than a month?


[02-Feb-19 01:42 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Ya it’s about $140 a month.


[02-Feb-19 01:42 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Will go up as I add disk. Only 64gb there now.


[02-Feb-19 01:42 PM] Vilenarios#8742
It’s also on-demand instance, the price would go down a lot if I reserved it for a year or 3 years.

2000 AR/month at 140$ means, the price of AR has to be 7 cents to break even

[03-Feb-19 08:38 AM] Vilenarios#8742
@prk I agree. However technically no AR mining is profitable at the moment.


[03-Feb-19 08:39 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Getting a rate of 7 cents an AR is less than the first private seed round Arweave did. So I have a good chance of breaking even if it does dump to .1x of ICO price


[03-Feb-19 08:39 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Plus I can just shut it off when it’s not profitable. I’m not stuck with some miner that can’t be sold.


[03-Feb-19 08:40 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I don’t expect a puny 4 core to stay profitable. But damn it’s doing pretty well.


[03-Feb-19 08:42 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Been meaning to bump it to 8 core and see if I get 2x the rewards. Not sure if it would work like that.  My on prem miner with max miner 16 only gets about 1/3rd more rewards than my cloud miner, even though it has 4x the amount of cores.


[04-Feb-19 04:20 AM] arweave-martin#1169
139 nodes on the main fork currently. Viewblock is reporting 603 nodes, whatever that means. Probably they count the number of unique addresses on the /peers endpoint which is not a good metric.


[04-Feb-19 06:23 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-martin Martin, What do you think, who more accurately displays the number of nodes, ViewBlock or chronobot.io?


[04-Feb-19 06:25 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Viewblock is too high, because I do not see a decrease in the number of awards proportional to the increase in the number of nodes.


[04-Feb-19 06:26 AM] arweave-martin#1169
I don't know what chronbot.io is reporting but I think the only good metric is the number of nodes on the main fork.


[04-Feb-19 06:28 AM] arweave-martin#1169
But it's completely depending on what you would like to see.

@arweave-martin can you  tell how can we see see which ones in which fork ?


[04-Feb-19 08:19 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@woombash The info endpoint (e.g. http://34.216.88.202:1984/info) exposes which block they are on. Just check all nodes. Almost all online nodes are on the main fork. There is one node running an outdated version of the node software (from before the hard fork in November), and then there are a few which stalled a long time ago which no one seems to care about.


[04-Feb-19 08:33 AM] arweave-martin#1169
We have some internal tools for this but we don't have more access to data than anyone else. We're running a bunch of nodes ourselves though so that we get a good understanding of how the network behaves.


[04-Feb-19 09:01 AM] Vilenarios#8742
your ndoes arent mining though, right?


[04-Feb-19 09:04 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@Vilenarios Our nodes are mining as little as possible. So for the past few weeks we've had 4 nodes mining but with `max_miners 1`. Our plan is to put all our rewards back into reward pool. I don't know if we have ever done that yet.

@arweave-martin


[04-Feb-19 10:17 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@! [[$0m€B0dy Unfortunately, you cannot easily list all rewards for a given wallet address. You need to scan the blocks and look for rewards going to your address.


[04-Feb-19 10:22 AM] ! [[$0m€B0dy#0101
how to scan?


[04-Feb-19 10:22 AM] ! [[$0m€B0dy#0101
@arweave-martin


[04-Feb-19 10:31 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@! [[$0m€B0dy You need to scan the blocks on disk and write some Erlang code to calculate the reward. If you're somewhat confident in doing this, then I can point you in the right direction.

Hey,  did anyone get response from Base58 otc desk? And any idea about their price?


[04-Feb-19 02:59 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@ivhturp I wrote to them today, while no one answered. If something is known - I will immediately write


[04-Feb-19 08:24 PM] ivhturp#3325
Sure bro.  Even i did write.  Let's wait and see


[04-Feb-19 08:28 PM] Mazzz#1871
Hi everyone, I keep getting the "could_not_start_mining" and then the "stored_recall_block_for_foreign_verification". Can anyone please tell me what this means?


[04-Feb-19 08:47 PM] Mazzz#1871
Wait does this just mean that I have to wait for blocks to download?


[04-Feb-19 08:47 PM] Mazzz#1871
Also why is a static IP better than a dynamic ip?


[04-Feb-19 11:05 PM] Mazzz#1871
How long do blocks typi Ally take to download and how much do I need to start hashing?


[04-Feb-19 11:43 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@Mazzz Typically FULL block download takes about a week. But you can start mining even if you have a small percentage of blocks, but at least 50 blocks. Moreover, the probability of block mining will decrease in proportion to the existing number of blocks.


[05-Feb-19 05:46 AM] Mazzz#1871
Thanks. I assume mining starts at the same time as blocks are being downloaded


[05-Feb-19 05:48 AM] Mazzz#1871
Also what is the fork recovery proc that happened at block 135000? I'm really interested to know what it's for


[05-Feb-19 07:50 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@Mazzz What do you mean by "fork recovery proc"? The only hard fork we've had so far was at block height 95000.


[06-Feb-19 07:51 PM] Mazzz#1871
As I understand your ip esentially your "reputation" on the network am I right? What are the benefits of that reputation?


[07-Feb-19 07:44 AM] tiamat#9131
a higher chance of getting your blocks accepted, so higher rewards


[07-Feb-19 07:15 PM] ATLAS#7218
I don't think that's the case. It is very unlikely to receive 2 blocks at the same time and otherwise you will prioritize the one you received early until you realise you're on a minor fork. I think if you have high reputation you will receive the new block faster so you can start mining before some other nodes.


[08-Feb-19 08:49 AM] JW#2445
Hi guys! Did I miss the upgrade instructions for release 20? Could someone please provide me those? Thanks in advance!


[08-Feb-19 08:51 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Hey @JW, the last update was from @arweave-martin in the # tech-announcements channel.


[08-Feb-19 10:32 AM] JW#2445
@arweave-sophie Thnx! Completely missed the announcement


[08-Feb-19 10:35 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
No worries @JW, you can catch up on any future announcements in the # tech-announcements channel. Or you can give me a shout on Discord, i'd be happy to help :arweave:


[10-Feb-19 07:44 AM] Mazzz#1871
Hey everyone   Just a few quick questions again. Firstly what benefits does kernel polling provide and how do I enable it? And secondly is it possible to transfer data between mining machines? Would you just need to copy blocks, TXS and wallet list to another miner?


[10-Feb-19 10:48 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@Mazzz I just transferred the entire folder to another server and everything worked.


[10-Feb-19 07:39 PM] chriscord#4741
@Mazzz yes you just need to copy over wallet_lists, blocks and txs


[10-Feb-19 07:41 PM] Mazzz#1871
@chriscord @slayer_hellraiser thanks! Transferred everything to a Google cloud miner but performance is not at the level I would expect at the moment


[11-Feb-19 05:31 AM] prk#3209
Hey guys


[11-Feb-19 05:33 AM] prk#3209
After running the Arweave serve, it's showing like
Joining Arweave Network
Joined Arweave Network successfully
Successfuly proved Access to recall block. Starting to hash


[11-Feb-19 05:34 AM] prk#3209
But when I ran make log, it shows
Could not start mining
Stored recall block for foreign verification


[11-Feb-19 05:34 AM] prk#3209
Is it ok?


[11-Feb-19 05:48 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@prk Yeah. Just waiting for start mining.


[11-Feb-19 05:50 AM] prk#3209
@slayer_hellraiser ok thanks


[11-Feb-19 05:51 AM] prk#3209
Any way to check out how much % of total blocks I have downloaded?


[11-Feb-19 05:52 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@prk >>Any way to check out how much % of total blocks I have downloaded?
Your_IP:1984, "height" and "blocks"


[11-Feb-19 05:53 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@prk it's OK if you see this in arweave output:
[Stage 1/3] Successfully proved access to recall block. Starting to hash.


[11-Feb-19 05:54 AM] prk#3209
@slayer_hellraiser height 138758 and blocks 1007


[11-Feb-19 05:55 AM] prk#3209
So it means I have downloaded 1007 blocks out of total 138758 I think


[11-Feb-19 05:55 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
If you just go to your ip on 1984 you'll get a few bits of info from there, for example

`http://54.93.54.173:1984`

```json
{
  "network": "arweave.N.1",
  "version": 5,
  "release": 20,

  "blocks": 156444,
  "peers": 122,
  "queue_length": 0,
  "node_state_latency": 6894
}
```


[11-Feb-19 05:55 AM] prk#3209
@slayer_hellraiser yeah, I m seeing that starting to hash


[11-Feb-19 05:56 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@prk 
>>So it means I have downloaded 1007 blocks out of total 138758 I think
Yepp


[11-Feb-19 05:56 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Just waiting for your first mined block, dude )


[11-Feb-19 05:58 AM] prk#3209
So at this speed it ll take nearly one month to download all the blocks😐


[11-Feb-19 06:00 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@prk Bear in mind that when connected, the miner waited about 8 minutes before connecting to the network. In my case, all the blocks downloaded in about 12 days (in early January)


[11-Feb-19 06:00 AM] Vilenarios#8742
how long as hit been mining for?


[11-Feb-19 06:00 AM] Vilenarios#8742
1007 is not that much at all


[11-Feb-19 06:00 AM] arweave-ivan#6776
Remember you don't need to dl the whole blockchain before you can start mining.  You only need the most recent 50.

{Reactions}
arweave 

[11-Feb-19 06:01 AM] prk#3209
Started few hours before only 


[11-Feb-19 06:01 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-ivan  But at the same time, the probability of getting a block is approximately the number_of_downloaded_blocks/total_number_of_blocks


[11-Feb-19 06:02 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
I'm right?


[11-Feb-19 06:03 AM] arweave-ivan#6776
Correct.  Your node can download recall blocks as required though.


[11-Feb-19 06:04 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Good.


[11-Feb-19 06:04 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
I already have all of them )


[11-Feb-19 06:05 AM] arweave-ivan#6776
 


[11-Feb-19 06:05 AM] prk#3209
@arweave-ivan I'm seeing like successfully called recall block multiple times when I ran make log. Those comes in those required 50 I guess


[11-Feb-19 06:06 AM] arweave-ivan#6776
That's right.  The blocks will be on disk eg in the blocks/ directory.


[11-Feb-19 06:07 AM] prk#3209
There are actually tons of blocks that I can see in the blocks folder


[11-Feb-19 06:08 AM] arweave-ivan#6776
Yes they soon mount up     The node will catch up before long.


[11-Feb-19 06:10 AM] prk#3209
Nice


[11-Feb-19 06:11 AM] arweave-ivan#6776
 


[11-Feb-19 07:49 AM] prk#3209
How to set max_miners?


[11-Feb-19 07:49 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@prk same question @arweave-kyle


[11-Feb-19 07:50 AM] arweave-ivan#6776
You can set it with the command-line argument max_miners


[11-Feb-19 07:55 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-ivan How?


[11-Feb-19 07:55 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
In start script?


[11-Feb-19 07:57 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Like that?
arweave-server PEER_LIST max_miners=6 mine mining_addr MY_ADDRESS


[11-Feb-19 07:58 AM] arweave-ivan#6776
If you start the server with `arweave-server` ...


[11-Feb-19 07:58 AM] arweave-ivan#6776
Yes or rather `... max_miners 6 ...`


[11-Feb-19 07:58 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-ivan Thanks


[11-Feb-19 07:59 AM] prk#3209
Is setting max_miners necessary?


[11-Feb-19 07:59 AM] arweave-ivan#6776
No there is a default


[11-Feb-19 07:59 AM] arweave-ivan#6776
Let me check what the default is ...


[11-Feb-19 07:59 AM] prk#3209
I mean I started Arweave server without using max_miner command


[11-Feb-19 08:00 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-ivan How can I check how many miners are actually running?


[11-Feb-19 08:00 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
I see this (max_miners 7):
Building dependencies...
Launching Erlang Virtual Machine...
Erlang/OTP 20 [erts-9.1] [source] [64-bit] [smp:8:8] [ds:8:8:10] [async-threads:10] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]


[11-Feb-19 08:01 AM] prk#3209
@slayer_hellraiser where do you see that?


[11-Feb-19 08:02 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@prk After run this script (command):
arweave-server PEER_LIST max_miners=7 mine mining_addr MY_ADDRESS


[11-Feb-19 08:02 AM] arweave-ivan#6776
Default is number of cores on your machine, minus one.


[11-Feb-19 08:04 AM] prk#3209
@slayer_hellraiser I can't see that


[11-Feb-19 08:04 AM] prk#3209
@arweave-ivan any command to check max miners?


[11-Feb-19 08:04 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
As I understand it, this variable is determined automatically and in principle does not require adjustment?@arweave-ivan


[11-Feb-19 08:05 AM] arweave-ivan#6776
@prk  just looking ...  


[11-Feb-19 08:05 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@prk What you see after run command?


[11-Feb-19 08:05 AM] arweave-ivan#6776
@slayer_hellraiser  the default is the best value: higher puts a lot of load on the machine; lower performance is suboptimal.


[11-Feb-19 08:05 AM] prk#3209
@slayer_hellraiser everything except that max_miner thing


[11-Feb-19 08:06 AM] prk#3209
In my VM blocks are getting downloaded like 300 blocks / hour


[11-Feb-19 08:06 AM] prk#3209
Is that normal?


[11-Feb-19 08:07 AM] arweave-ivan#6776
Seems fairly healthy.


[11-Feb-19 08:07 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-ivan I think so too. In any case, one core should always be left for system needs.


[11-Feb-19 08:07 AM] arweave-ivan#6776
@slayer_hellraiser exactly


[11-Feb-19 08:07 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@prk I write it in my command.


[11-Feb-19 08:08 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
arweave-server PEER_LIST max_miners=7 mine mining_addr MY_ADDRESS


[11-Feb-19 08:08 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
In center


[11-Feb-19 08:08 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
max_miners=7


[11-Feb-19 08:08 AM] arweave-ivan#6776
To check max_miners setting: if you are in the erlang shell you can do: `ar_meta_db:get(max_miners).` (remember the final period)


[11-Feb-19 08:17 AM] prk#3209
@slayer_hellraiser max_miners=7 
Or
max_miners 7 ?


[11-Feb-19 08:38 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@prk As @arweave-ivan wrote above, there is no difference


[11-Feb-19 08:48 AM] prk#3209
@slayer_hellraiser ok thanks


[11-Feb-19 09:34 AM] Mazzz#1871
I keep seeing 4 or 5 of the same miners mining almost 80% of the blocks. I'm really interested in your setups if you're part of this group :)


[11-Feb-19 09:37 AM] Vilenarios#8742
uhhh yeah id like to ask as well


[11-Feb-19 09:39 AM] Vilenarios#8742
although is it really 80% of all the blocks? itd be nice to see a piechart of all blocks mined


[11-Feb-19 10:01 AM] arweave-ivan#6776
Do you mean the same 4 or 5 miners in your local network, or the arweave overall?


[11-Feb-19 10:46 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-ivan Arweave overall.


[11-Feb-19 10:47 AM] arweave-ivan#6776
Sorry, my question was directed at @Mazzz


[11-Feb-19 11:02 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
I have same question


[11-Feb-19 11:03 AM] arweave-ivan#6776
We do have some nodes mining, but they are mining at the absolute minimum to keep online & in sync with the rest of the network.


[11-Feb-19 12:38 PM] Marcin#0065
Will the network be tested soon? We havent seen a real scenario, where massive data and large amounts of transaction occur


[11-Feb-19 01:06 PM] chriscord#4741
I’m also concerned that a small number of miners are receiving a significant or majority share of the rewards. Leads to centralization  or the perception of that, which would discourage new miners


[11-Feb-19 01:07 PM] Marcin#0065
@chriscord saying that for months.... it wont change


[11-Feb-19 01:12 PM] Vilenarios#8742
im gonna do a simple chart of the past 24 hours of rewards


[11-Feb-19 01:12 PM] Vilenarios#8742
if i had more raw data i could extend the results


[11-Feb-19 01:17 PM] chriscord#4741
@Marcin I hope the team  takes it seriously. It also messes with the token economy when a small number of miners control a large share of AR


[11-Feb-19 01:20 PM] Marcin#0065
@chriscord dude... i tried for months... 0 reaction by the team. Dont even try :)


[11-Feb-19 01:25 PM] Vilenarios#8742
okay well


[11-Feb-19 01:25 PM] Vilenarios#8742
i got a nice pie chart


[11-Feb-19 01:26 PM] Vilenarios#8742
ill share the data in a bit


[11-Feb-19 01:26 PM] Vilenarios#8742
got to jump to a meeting... looks like there  are 8 main miners doing 5% or more


[11-Feb-19 01:27 PM] Vilenarios#8742
the largest getting %12 of all rewards in the last hour


[11-Feb-19 02:56 PM] rehash#3438
so you are concerned about centralization, but in the same time, you want the team to slow down fast miners and give more to slow miners? "The bureaucracy is expanding to meet the needs of the expanding bureaucracy"


[11-Feb-19 03:54 PM] Marcin#0065
@rehash in early days they proclaimed, that rewards are mainly for storage and internet connection and some for cpu power.
But all we got now is pure hashing power what matters.


[11-Feb-19 03:54 PM] Marcin#0065
The way it is now is not very inviting for newcomers to set up a fresh node


[11-Feb-19 03:55 PM] Marcin#0065
So, yes, we may be worried about centralisation.
But its only worries and for every problem you can find solutions :)


[11-Feb-19 05:40 PM] Vilenarios#8742
well its not easy to post a pic here so

[11-Feb-19 05:41 PM] Vilenarios#8742
top 5 miners mined 63% of all coins in that period


[11-Feb-19 05:42 PM] Vilenarios#8742
@Mazzz so its not 80% per se, but still kinda high


[11-Feb-19 05:43 PM] Vilenarios#8742
If you look at bitcoin mining, the top 5 miners have 59.7% total hash rate


[11-Feb-19 05:44 PM] Vilenarios#8742
the wallets are distributed too, so it looks like there are some new miners onboarded on the list above.  i remember some of them like aE1A used to have so many hits daily, now its a lot less.  oaaVg is killing it though.


[11-Feb-19 05:44 PM] ATLAS#7218
@chriscord its happening because the community is small.


[11-Feb-19 05:44 PM] Vilenarios#8742
So in the end, th network needs really strong players


[11-Feb-19 05:45 PM] ATLAS#7218
Now its more like a premine


[11-Feb-19 05:45 PM] Vilenarios#8742
a community premine


[11-Feb-19 05:45 PM] Vilenarios#8742
i guess?


[11-Feb-19 05:45 PM] ATLAS#7218
Yup.


[11-Feb-19 05:46 PM] ATLAS#7218
Which rekt the investors


[11-Feb-19 05:46 PM] ATLAS#7218
Not cool


[11-Feb-19 05:46 PM] ATLAS#7218
Not fuckin cool.


[11-Feb-19 05:46 PM] ATLAS#7218
It was cool and fun to mine until my cash turnt into ash


[11-Feb-19 05:47 PM] Vilenarios#8742
ah well, crypto wont be down forever.  i wouldnt count arweave out just yet. exchanging listing will be painful for sure but it it will really test the network right off the bat


[11-Feb-19 05:47 PM] ATLAS#7218
Yo dude


[11-Feb-19 05:47 PM] ATLAS#7218
Wtf man


[11-Feb-19 05:48 PM] ATLAS#7218
Exchange listing will be painful


[11-Feb-19 05:48 PM] ATLAS#7218
So what?


[11-Feb-19 05:48 PM] ATLAS#7218
You want it to never list?


[11-Feb-19 05:49 PM] Vilenarios#8742
no, im not saying that at all!


[11-Feb-19 05:49 PM] Vilenarios#8742
i would list it tomorrow if i had oppoertunity


[11-Feb-19 05:49 PM] Vilenarios#8742
im just saying at this point, no matter when they put it out there - our cash will be ash, as you say


[11-Feb-19 05:49 PM] Vilenarios#8742
just gotta rip off the bandaid


[11-Feb-19 05:49 PM] Vilenarios#8742
and move on


[11-Feb-19 05:49 PM] Vilenarios#8742
and hopefully arweave builds upon there


[11-Feb-19 05:49 PM] Vilenarios#8742
and our network gets more solidified.  nobody knows about arweave in most of the mining community still


[11-Feb-19 05:50 PM] ATLAS#7218
I am saying my concern in hope that team will listen


[11-Feb-19 05:50 PM] Vilenarios#8742
i just bought another miner now that we have multi-port


[11-Feb-19 05:50 PM] Vilenarios#8742
i agree with ya baz


[11-Feb-19 05:51 PM] ATLAS#7218
We mining is no longer fun. I'm just stabbing myself in the back at this point


[11-Feb-19 05:51 PM] ATLAS#7218
Stabbing every investors to be precise


[11-Feb-19 05:51 PM] Vilenarios#8742
meh more like dollar cost averaging your initial investment


[11-Feb-19 05:52 PM] ATLAS#7218
Yo


[11-Feb-19 05:52 PM] ATLAS#7218
You DCA until you have no money?


[11-Feb-19 05:52 PM] Vilenarios#8742
lol nah definitely not - but for me i dont mind paying the electricity bill to get the amount of AR im getting now.  its all a speculative bet anyway


[11-Feb-19 05:52 PM] ATLAS#7218
You do that early in time when there was less miners and I did that


[11-Feb-19 05:52 PM] Vilenarios#8742
as is like any kind of mining, unelss ur just doing nicehash right to btc or something


[11-Feb-19 05:53 PM] Vilenarios#8742
if i build another computer to mine AR ill give it to my kid one day when its all over with


[11-Feb-19 05:53 PM] ATLAS#7218
And even if I am cost averaging with a node. You gonna blame the burnt investors who didnt mine that its their fault?


[11-Feb-19 05:53 PM] Vilenarios#8742
dude no way im not saying that at all


[11-Feb-19 05:54 PM] Vilenarios#8742
i am a burnt investor as well, and i know many others...


[11-Feb-19 05:54 PM] ATLAS#7218
Yeah just saying example


[11-Feb-19 05:54 PM] ATLAS#7218
I mean it makes no sense


[11-Feb-19 05:54 PM] ATLAS#7218
You just saying cost average in this situation


[11-Feb-19 05:55 PM] ATLAS#7218
When we have 0 liquidity in 8th month


[11-Feb-19 05:55 PM] ATLAS#7218
Thats why team is not taking this seriously


[11-Feb-19 05:55 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Ya, its not for everyone. Buying a miner is just as illiquid as arweave pretty much


[11-Feb-19 05:56 PM] ATLAS#7218
It gotta get listed so miners get more competition and liquidity


[11-Feb-19 05:57 PM] ATLAS#7218
That's how you grow. Even community projects which had no ICO lists in some crappy exchange for the miners


[11-Feb-19 05:58 PM] ATLAS#7218
So they know if they are profitable and can liquidate at ease


[11-Feb-19 06:01 PM] ATLAS#7218
I could mine 3500 AR per 100$ when I had my optimal setup


[11-Feb-19 06:01 PM] ATLAS#7218
Which makes the price around 3 cent.


[11-Feb-19 06:03 PM] ATLAS#7218
So I did my DCA enough. You guys better think that it will dump to around that price when it gets on exchange.


[11-Feb-19 06:03 PM] ATLAS#7218
Happy mining.


[11-Feb-19 06:19 PM] awkweird#6550
Agree with you @ATLAS


[11-Feb-19 06:22 PM] awkweird#6550
Tokens must’ve listed a long ago


[11-Feb-19 06:24 PM] awkweird#6550
Personally, i had to stop my miner cuz i can’t pay the bills.


[11-Feb-19 10:23 PM] prk#3209
3 cents lol


[11-Feb-19 10:24 PM] prk#3209
Token price during seed round was around 3 - 5 cents.


[11-Feb-19 10:24 PM] prk#3209
That too when ETH was like 700$


[11-Feb-19 10:24 PM] prk#3209
ETH is 1/6th now, so AR should be below 1 cent


[11-Feb-19 10:25 PM] prk#3209
Then there is dilution by mining too🤷


[12-Feb-19 01:05 AM] tiamat#9131
We don't have classic miners here which generally dump their tokens the same day, because coin is not listed  


[12-Feb-19 01:13 AM] prk#3209
Yeah wait for the listing day, it's gonna be funny


[12-Feb-19 01:31 AM] chriscord#4741
I’m sorry it doesn’t make mathematical sense that the top 5 miners are mining more than 60% of the rewards


[12-Feb-19 01:33 AM] chriscord#4741
Can someone on the team explain how this is theoretically possible


[12-Feb-19 01:34 AM] chriscord#4741
From my understanding you will need some crazy multiple in terms of hash power over everyone else for this to happen consistently


[12-Feb-19 01:34 AM] chriscord#4741
Unless someone is gaming the system


[12-Feb-19 01:37 AM] Marcin#0065
I prefere a good product at listing, which can be used by everone intuitively rather than with terminal code experience. 
So i can wait a year more for listing fot that. 
If they list before any GUI, the acceptance wont be high and so the project wonz get any serious attention.


[12-Feb-19 01:38 AM] ATLAS#7218
.....................


[12-Feb-19 02:14 AM] tiamat#9131
@chriscord you can mine with one address on many servers


[12-Feb-19 02:14 AM] tiamat#9131
plus I think some of those nodes are just cheap vps


[12-Feb-19 02:16 AM] tiamat#9131
so it's not like we have 100+ serious miners, more like 10 I think


[12-Feb-19 02:43 AM] awkweird#6550
Mining on one address is possible.


[12-Feb-19 02:51 AM] prk#3209
How much days will it take to receive the first block approximately?


[12-Feb-19 02:51 AM] prk#3209
I m running on an 8 core machine


[12-Feb-19 03:10 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@prk I mined my first block in same day


[12-Feb-19 03:42 AM] ivhturp#3325
@prk ETH was around $20 during seed round if I am correct. I did buy for 0.7$ in community sale though  


[12-Feb-19 03:44 AM] ivhturp#3325
@Vilenarios That was nice analysis dude.   I have been thinking to do it from long time!
Could you please share the script if you dont mind - will be fun to check daily statistics


[12-Feb-19 03:52 AM] prk#3209
@slayer_hellraiser I didn't get any yet😑


[12-Feb-19 03:53 AM] prk#3209
@ivhturp 20$? When was the seed round🤔


[12-Feb-19 03:54 AM] ivhturp#3325
Most miners will be in good profits even at 10% of ICO price and they will dump the tokens on first exchange listing for liquidity. 
I dont see how the team can protect investors from miners dumping immediately. Luckily, I have mined good number of AR compared to what I have purchased during ICO - Or am  I risking too much assuming it doesnt list anytime soon    


[12-Feb-19 03:54 AM] ivhturp#3325
@prk not sure.. maybe mid 2017


[12-Feb-19 03:54 AM] ATLAS#7218
Is it even possible to protect investors from the dump lmao


[12-Feb-19 03:54 AM] ATLAS#7218
Mid2017, Eth was way pricey


[12-Feb-19 03:55 AM] ATLAS#7218
Should be March or smth?


[12-Feb-19 03:55 AM] ivhturp#3325
@Vilenarios knows it better. He is there with Arweave from long back


[12-Feb-19 03:55 AM] prk#3209
ETH was not 20$ definitely lol


[12-Feb-19 03:55 AM] ATLAS#7218
Not quite remember


[12-Feb-19 03:56 AM] ivhturp#3325
@prk true. I was told by someone  in group that ETH was quite cheap during seed round


[12-Feb-19 03:56 AM] prk#3209
Eth was above 300$


[12-Feb-19 03:57 AM] ivhturp#3325
It was 20 in feb 17


[12-Feb-19 03:58 AM] prk#3209
Sale was after june


[12-Feb-19 03:58 AM] ivhturp#3325
Should we do a poll for AR price on launch? And at what price you are ready to dump?


[12-Feb-19 04:02 AM] prk#3209
Maybe


[12-Feb-19 04:05 AM] ATLAS#7218
I guess I'll hodl :(


[12-Feb-19 04:06 AM] ATLAS#7218
25 cent will be a nice offer


[12-Feb-19 04:06 AM] ATLAS#7218
BUT THATS TOO OPTIMISTIC


[12-Feb-19 04:06 AM] ivhturp#3325
No one knows for sure about seedround and token price. I remember @prk asking for details but we didnt get much details


[12-Feb-19 04:07 AM] ATLAS#7218
I already started going to psychotherapy


[12-Feb-19 04:07 AM] ivhturp#3325
Lol


[12-Feb-19 04:07 AM] ATLAS#7218
So I'm fully prepared


[12-Feb-19 04:07 AM] ivhturp#3325
25 cents is too optimistic given market conditions


[12-Feb-19 04:08 AM] ATLAS#7218
Yeah. I'll just hodl through this dump


[12-Feb-19 04:08 AM] ATLAS#7218
I dont wanna sell at 5 cent :(


[12-Feb-19 04:09 AM] ATLAS#7218
RIP my investment


[12-Feb-19 04:09 AM] ATLAS#7218
RIP fellow investors


[12-Feb-19 04:09 AM] ivhturp#3325
Going by ETH price we are already down by 80% around 600$ to 120$. I dont see much marketing from Arweave. So i doubt if it would sell for 0.25


[12-Feb-19 04:10 AM] ATLAS#7218
Yeah it will be a heavy bag for sure


[12-Feb-19 04:10 AM] ATLAS#7218
But I already waited for 7 friggin month.


[12-Feb-19 04:10 AM] ATLAS#7218
Too committed at this point


[12-Feb-19 04:11 AM] ivhturp#3325
Haha, lets hope the team pulls off a miracle


[12-Feb-19 04:11 AM] ATLAS#7218
Better just wait for it to pump and hope for the best.


[12-Feb-19 04:12 AM] ATLAS#7218
You better hope the miners will choose not to dump  and pump instead


[12-Feb-19 04:12 AM] ATLAS#7218
To make hype and increase their profit


[12-Feb-19 04:13 AM] ATLAS#7218
Crypto is full of ideas. Decent idea is not the only key to success.


[12-Feb-19 04:14 AM] ATLAS#7218
They get their most attention by profitability


[12-Feb-19 04:18 AM] ATLAS#7218
One shitty coin 5x's and everyone in this space will get to know and research about it.


[12-Feb-19 04:29 AM] tiamat#9131
About marketing just look at NKN which has 6 exchanges, 5000+ nodes and their chain keeps hanging every few days, they have to restart from snapshots.


[12-Feb-19 04:32 AM] ATLAS#7218
5000 nodes


[12-Feb-19 04:32 AM] ATLAS#7218
They did ICO at around the same time.


[12-Feb-19 04:32 AM] ATLAS#7218
But yeah NKN didn't even have testnet iirc


[12-Feb-19 04:33 AM] tiamat#9131
they probably raised more


[12-Feb-19 04:33 AM] ATLAS#7218
But they did way more


[12-Feb-19 04:33 AM] tiamat#9131
because they bought tokens from miners with ETH when only ERC20 was listed


[12-Feb-19 04:33 AM] ATLAS#7218
In this short span, they didnt have testnet but they have 5000 nodes now


[12-Feb-19 04:33 AM] tiamat#9131
their tokens are not listed, only the erc20 equivalent


[12-Feb-19 04:34 AM] tiamat#9131
they will have a problem listing their own token because chain is very unstable


[12-Feb-19 04:34 AM] tiamat#9131
but who cares  


[12-Feb-19 04:34 AM] ATLAS#7218
Erc20 equivalent is good. You can list on exchanges easily without losing much


[12-Feb-19 04:36 AM] tiamat#9131
short term is good, but then exchange could reject you your natives


[12-Feb-19 04:39 AM] tiamat#9131
also when they make an update, they spawn like more nodes than the majority and force kick everyne's node out, pretty funny


[12-Feb-19 04:40 AM] ATLAS#7218
Otherwise its hard to make major update with 5000 nodes


[12-Feb-19 04:41 AM] ATLAS#7218
Most probably majority won't update causing the main fork to be old version


[12-Feb-19 04:41 AM] ATLAS#7218
We didn't have that issue because it wasn't major update on consensus etc


[12-Feb-19 04:42 AM] tiamat#9131
yes, we had a hard fork


[12-Feb-19 04:42 AM] tiamat#9131
but it was well planned


[12-Feb-19 04:42 AM] tiamat#9131
10k block ahead or something


[12-Feb-19 04:42 AM] ATLAS#7218
You can plan but with 5000 nodes its hard to force them update


[12-Feb-19 04:43 AM] ATLAS#7218
So the first updaters will lose their potential rewards because they are the minority


[12-Feb-19 04:44 AM] ATLAS#7218
There is that dilemma making noone update unless being forced to do so


[12-Feb-19 05:27 AM] prk#3209
@ivhturp around 10 million AR was sold at an average price of 3 cents during initial rounds


[12-Feb-19 06:06 AM] prk#3209
Guys I ran "htop" command and see's almost all CPUs idle


[12-Feb-19 06:06 AM] prk#3209
What could be the issue?


[12-Feb-19 06:21 AM] ATLAS#7218
Yeah that'll be the case when you have few blocks


[12-Feb-19 06:22 AM] prk#3209
I have around 12k blocks


[12-Feb-19 06:22 AM] prk#3209
That is around 9%


[12-Feb-19 06:22 AM] prk#3209
Is that less?


[12-Feb-19 06:22 AM] ATLAS#7218
It translates to 9% chance of starting to mine.


[12-Feb-19 06:23 AM] ATLAS#7218
You can compete for the next block in 9% of the time.


[12-Feb-19 06:23 AM] prk#3209
Yesterday I was seeing most CPUs at 90 - 100%


[12-Feb-19 06:23 AM] prk#3209
 


[12-Feb-19 06:23 AM] ATLAS#7218
Yeah so if it starts


[12-Feb-19 06:23 AM] prk#3209
Now all are at 0%


[12-Feb-19 06:23 AM] ATLAS#7218
It will go for high cpu usage but to start there is a low chance


[12-Feb-19 06:25 AM] prk#3209
But how did it show CPUs at 90% yesterday


[12-Feb-19 06:25 AM] ATLAS#7218
So basically, to mine the next block you have to have the 'recall' block which is simply random previous block. If you have that block you will try to mine the block otherwise you will wait for the next one


[12-Feb-19 06:26 AM] prk#3209
[1/3 ] acces to recall block. Starting to hash is showing


[12-Feb-19 06:26 AM] ATLAS#7218
It can be for the previous block


[12-Feb-19 06:26 AM] ATLAS#7218
I stopped looking at the logs but


[12-Feb-19 06:27 AM] ATLAS#7218
If its actually mining your cpu usage should be high


[12-Feb-19 07:01 AM] prk#3209
Blocks are getting added btw


[12-Feb-19 07:03 AM] Mazzz#1871
@prk if you have the recall block required you will mine, if you don't then you will download more recall blocks


[12-Feb-19 07:03 AM] Mazzz#1871
That's what I understand at least


[12-Feb-19 07:09 AM] prk#3209
Yeah, I understood that


[12-Feb-19 07:09 AM] prk#3209
But presently all CPUs are idle. Seems weird


[12-Feb-19 07:15 AM] Mazzz#1871
Well if you're not mining there's nothing really for them to do


[12-Feb-19 07:15 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Ya all ur doing is just syncing the blockchain


[12-Feb-19 07:16 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Downloading and writing to disk


[12-Feb-19 07:19 AM] Vilenarios#8742
@ivhturp lol I wish I had a nice script to pull the data from view block. I just copied and pasted right into a spreadsheet.


[12-Feb-19 07:21 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I just wanted to show that yes, the coin has a few bigger miners, but wallet distribution isn’t so centralized from a mining perspective. Who knows who owns what.


[12-Feb-19 07:21 AM] Vilenarios#8742
And there still are a lot of smaller miners mining many blocks as well.


[12-Feb-19 07:34 AM] Vilenarios#8742
40 total unique mining addresses out of 550 nodes (reported on viewblock)


[12-Feb-19 07:35 AM] prk#3209
So only 40 guys mining?


[12-Feb-19 07:35 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Noo up to 550 guys mining


[12-Feb-19 07:35 AM] Vilenarios#8742
More if u include polling still


[12-Feb-19 07:36 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Yeah I ran some analysis a couple of months ago over the full chain and there were over 500/600 distinct reward addresses


[12-Feb-19 07:36 AM] prk#3209
That's less


[12-Feb-19 07:37 AM] prk#3209
Btw, option to use permaweb to deploy custom domains are available now?


[12-Feb-19 08:29 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I would think so. Can’t you just buy a dns name and point it to your own node or load balancer vip


[12-Feb-19 09:06 AM] prk#3209
In usual cases it works, but not sure here


[12-Feb-19 09:07 AM] prk#3209
Is there any other project that provides Decentralised hosting services?


[12-Feb-19 09:14 AM] tiamat#9131
DADI I think


[12-Feb-19 09:36 AM] prk#3209
Thought they were dead


[12-Feb-19 12:11 PM] ivhturp#3325
@prk 3 cents huh! any idea when the sale has happened and vesting period for tokens?

Looks like bleak chances of AR above 10 cents upon listing.


[12-Feb-19 12:13 PM] DaVinci#0538
Lol looks like bleak chance ok listing period


[12-Feb-19 12:13 PM] ivhturp#3325
@Vilenarios well, single miner could also be using  multiple addresses


[12-Feb-19 12:27 PM] Vilenarios#8742
thats also true, there is no way to know - and im glad thats the case


[12-Feb-19 12:31 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Daily rewards halved over the past few days, but the network difficulty has not changed. Very strange...

what is the problem?


[12-Feb-19 01:54 PM] Vilenarios#8742
no problem


[12-Feb-19 01:54 PM] Vilenarios#8742
you have to have the recall block in order to start mining a new block


[12-Feb-19 01:54 PM] Vilenarios#8742
so if you dont have the recall block, your node will just download the blocks in the background


[12-Feb-19 03:23 PM] Vilenarios#8742
well the miner bug got me again, went from buying more gpus to a new arweave rig


[12-Feb-19 03:24 PM] Vilenarios#8742
going to take my main rig's i7-7920x and setup a new ubuntu miner, since it seems to use the CPU much more efficiently than windows


[12-Feb-19 03:24 PM] Vilenarios#8742
and replace main rig with a i7-7800k which is still LGA 2066


[13-Feb-19 01:08 AM] tiamat#9131
what do you mine with gpus? Grin?

@prk not a shitcoin dude. It is a community driven solid protocol and even binance labs is testing them out. Yeah it is volatile for now but for a community project with a brand new protocol they've already done a huge work.


[15-Feb-19 08:17 AM] prk#3209
Yeah maybe


[15-Feb-19 08:17 AM] prk#3209
But I hate seeing people shilling it everywhere


[15-Feb-19 08:36 AM] ATLAS#7218
I appreciate them. They're spreading the words. Raven wouldn't be where it is without the community and their shill


[15-Feb-19 08:49 AM] tiamat#9131
@ATLAS Grin does not bring anything new on the table... It's just for some early years BTC nostalgics...


[15-Feb-19 08:49 AM] prk#3209
Yeah agree on that @ATLAS


[15-Feb-19 08:50 AM] ATLAS#7218
@tiamat wow


[15-Feb-19 08:50 AM] ATLAS#7218
Theyre bringing whole new protocol which is working perfect so far.


[15-Feb-19 08:50 AM] prk#3209
I think we should start shilling AR everywhere 


[15-Feb-19 08:50 AM] ATLAS#7218
Yeah. Start shilling XD


[15-Feb-19 08:50 AM] prk#3209
After listing only lol


[15-Feb-19 08:51 AM] tiamat#9131
the protocol could be nice, like a serious coin could adopt it, but the coin Grin has no value


[15-Feb-19 08:51 AM] tiamat#9131
LTC already made a move in this sense


[15-Feb-19 08:52 AM] tiamat#9131
smart move I'd say, because LTC has no other purpose lately than a BTC clone


[15-Feb-19 10:46 AM] prk#3209
@ATLAS are you still mining on AWS?


[15-Feb-19 10:46 AM] ATLAS#7218
Nah.


[15-Feb-19 10:46 AM] ATLAS#7218
Mined enough when there was few miners


[15-Feb-19 10:47 AM] ATLAS#7218
@tiamat why does it have no value?


[15-Feb-19 10:47 AM] ATLAS#7218
Monero has no value?


[15-Feb-19 10:48 AM] ATLAS#7218
Its apparently trading with a value


[15-Feb-19 10:48 AM] ATLAS#7218
It has more value than AR at the moment


[15-Feb-19 10:48 AM] prk#3209
Which 16 core instance did you use at 150$/month?

[15-Feb-19 10:49 AM] prk#3209

[15-Feb-19 10:49 AM] ATLAS#7218
Yeah c16 or smtj


[15-Feb-19 10:49 AM] prk#3209
Ah ok


[15-Feb-19 10:49 AM] prk#3209
So it's actually a gamble now


[15-Feb-19 10:50 AM] prk#3209
With increased miners😐


[15-Feb-19 10:50 AM] ATLAS#7218
Yup definitely it will be more costly


[15-Feb-19 11:25 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Another miner of mine going online this weekend


[15-Feb-19 11:27 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Hope it will perform well. I’ve been tracking block rewards a lot closer the past month.


[15-Feb-19 11:27 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I’ll share my new build specs if anyone is interested.


[15-Feb-19 01:49 PM] tiamat#9131
@ATLAS yeah, one reason it does not have value is because we already have monero and zcash, being a little better than monero is nothing


[15-Feb-19 01:50 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@tiamat It is still profitable to mine Monero on the CPU?


[15-Feb-19 01:51 PM] tiamat#9131
no, because big miners do it through browsers


[15-Feb-19 07:47 PM] ATLAS#7218
@tiamat its protocol is different. Arweave is also not a new thing. Its blockweave structure is different


[15-Feb-19 09:45 PM] prk#3209
@Vilenarios Virtual machine?


[16-Feb-19 05:15 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Nah physical. I7-7800x


[16-Feb-19 05:33 AM] Vilenarios#8742
My main workstation has a i7-7920x so I’m putting that into a dedicated Ubuntu box and replacing with the i7800x


[16-Feb-19 05:34 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I could only really do max miner 14 on Windows with 24 core and every couple of days I would have to reboot it to fix that network port exhaustion issue


[16-Feb-19 05:35 AM] prk#3209
Hmm right


[16-Feb-19 05:35 AM] Vilenarios#8742
So I figure if I move the 7920x to Ubuntu it will have better up time and I can maybe do max miner 20


[16-Feb-19 05:35 AM] Vilenarios#8742
And do max miner 8 or something with the 7800x


[16-Feb-19 05:37 AM] prk#3209
Maybe it's because mining isn't available for windows yet


[16-Feb-19 05:37 AM] prk#3209
Are you using putty to connect?


[16-Feb-19 05:37 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Yeah I run my Ubuntu miners with no GUI so it’s ssh only


[16-Feb-19 05:38 AM] prk#3209
Btw no. Of nodes are growing fast


[16-Feb-19 05:50 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Ya I’m tryin to squeeze out more AR before storage requirements really jump up and the rewards get cut


[16-Feb-19 05:53 AM] prk#3209
I accidentally terminated the miner and restarted it


[16-Feb-19 05:53 AM] prk#3209
But the ip:1984 isn't connecting now


[16-Feb-19 05:53 AM] prk#3209
Any idea what could be the problem?


[16-Feb-19 05:56 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Did AWS give u a different public IP?


[16-Feb-19 05:57 AM] prk#3209
I didn't closed my instance


[16-Feb-19 05:57 AM] prk#3209
I actually closed the terminal running ./Arweave-server xxxx


[16-Feb-19 05:58 AM] prk#3209
The ip is same


[16-Feb-19 06:18 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Maybe your miner stopped then


[16-Feb-19 06:18 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Were you running your miner with “screen” or “nohup” ?


[16-Feb-19 06:19 AM] prk#3209
Screen


[16-Feb-19 06:21 AM] Vilenarios#8742
If u open another session and run “htop” do u see beam.smp still running?

[16-Feb-19 06:55 AM] prk#3209
Lol


[16-Feb-19 06:56 AM] prk#3209
185k is nearly 20% 😱


[16-Feb-19 06:56 AM] ivhturp#3325
Yeah I also have doubts, haha


[16-Feb-19 06:56 AM] ivhturp#3325
How do you know its 20% ?


[16-Feb-19 06:57 AM] prk#3209
I mean total AR mined till now is 1 million?


[16-Feb-19 06:57 AM] prk#3209
Maybe more idk


[16-Feb-19 06:57 AM] ivhturp#3325
Oh , I am not sure of total mined AR


[16-Feb-19 06:58 AM] prk#3209
It's between 1 - 1.5 million I think


[16-Feb-19 06:59 AM] prk#3209
@Vilenarios reboot the whole instance?


[16-Feb-19 07:05 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Yeah reboot your server


[16-Feb-19 07:05 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Then start your arweave_server again


[16-Feb-19 07:05 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Those big miners must be mining for big losses


[16-Feb-19 07:14 AM] prk#3209

Hello there, with a dynamic IP, shall I still run in polling mode, and in this case, how do I enable polling mode ?


[16-Feb-19 03:40 PM] courtcircuit#8002
I think I solved this.


[16-Feb-19 03:41 PM] courtcircuit#8002
however the simple check on port 1984 return


[16-Feb-19 03:41 PM] courtcircuit#8002
{"network":"arweave.N.1","version":5,"release":20,"height":-1,"current":"not_joined","blocks":54,"peers":97,"queue_length":2,"node_state_latency":29}


[16-Feb-19 03:42 PM] courtcircuit#8002
the  "current":"not_joined" means it can't join th network ? any idea where to look fo r? ( I have port 1984 open and forwarding)


[16-Feb-19 03:43 PM] courtcircuit#8002
and I have this : tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:1984            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      26297/beam.smp


[16-Feb-19 04:11 PM] Vilenarios#8742
It joins the network after it validates the last 100 blocks I believe.


[16-Feb-19 04:11 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Looks good though.


[16-Feb-19 04:26 PM] courtcircuit#8002
ok thanks. Would you adivse to use the polling option or not ?


[16-Feb-19 04:27 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I used it when I had multiple miners behind a single public IP. But now with multi ports available I don’t use it


[16-Feb-19 04:27 PM] Vilenarios#8742
If you have a dynamic IP it may be necessary but @arweave-martin would have to comment


[16-Feb-19 04:28 PM] courtcircuit#8002
ok thanks


[16-Feb-19 04:28 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Polling definitely has a lower chance of mining blocks. I think 7% less or something.


[16-Feb-19 04:28 PM] courtcircuit#8002
errrrr


[16-Feb-19 04:28 PM] courtcircuit#8002
I'll see what @arweave-martin says


[16-Feb-19 04:29 PM] courtcircuit#8002
oh and do you know what other port than 1984 i have to open ?


[16-Feb-19 05:10 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Just 1984


[16-Feb-19 05:10 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Unless you have multiple miners behind a single public IP


[16-Feb-19 05:10 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Then you can use the port parameter and specify another port for your second miner, like port 1985 or something.

I get that all the time


[17-Feb-19 04:15 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I think it just scans every partition you have

Obviously if the disk u got ur arweave folder on has free space then ur good to go

Why not just move your whole arweave folder to that drive?


[18-Feb-19 05:23 AM] Mazzz#1871
@Vilenarios  Hmm, I tried installing it to the drive before but it  came up with errors. Doesn't every program need to be on the same drive because of dependencies and stuff on linux?


[18-Feb-19 05:23 AM] Mazzz#1871
I'll copy the files over and try again


[18-Feb-19 05:25 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I don’t think so...


[18-Feb-19 05:25 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I’m not a Linux guy tho

Maybe... all mine are ext4

@Vilenarios well you don't nessasarily need graphics, ssh is your friend  .


[18-Feb-19 08:01 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Ya I know but I still like havin a gpu just in case. I’ll definitely be running this headless. It’s just another 30 bucks for a slim card.


[18-Feb-19 08:02 AM] Vilenarios#8742
One day I’ll try to sell this thing. I’m hoping a nice compact PC sells easier than a gpu miner

Hello,  I am trying to set up mining on a iMac and i have followed the instructions on the website. I have been stuck with Error since yesterday





[19-Feb-19 04:51 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@gucceed did you run `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/stable/install.sh | bash`?


[19-Feb-19 05:00 AM] gucceed#9385
No, at what point. according to the guide on the website MacOS  had a 2 step process


[19-Feb-19 05:00 AM] gucceed#9385
git clone https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave.git arweave && \
cd arweave && git -c advice.detachedHead=false checkout stabl


[19-Feb-19 05:02 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@gucceed sorry, the MacOS section does not mention the script indeed. Did you run `brew install erlang@20`?


[19-Feb-19 05:02 AM] gucceed#9385
yes. It was successful

Man pages can be found in:

Access them with `erl -man`, or add this directory to MANPATH.

erlang@20 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have erlang@20 first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/erlang@20/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

For compilers to find erlang@20 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/erlang@20/lib"

[19-Feb-19 05:27 AM] arweave-martin#1169
Hi @courtcircuit ! I recognise that crash. I'm guessing you have a big machine (i.e. many CPU cores) and don't specify the `max_miners` startup argument to `arweave-server`. What happens is that you will get high response times internally in the node, and eventually this timeout happens.


[19-Feb-19 05:27 AM] arweave-martin#1169
How many CPU cores do you have?


[19-Feb-19 05:28 AM] arweave-martin#1169
It's a known issue which we will address eventually.


[19-Feb-19 05:29 AM] arweave-martin#1169
You can see the current response time by browsing to `/info` and check the `node_state_latency` metric. It's in micro-seconds, so it can be a quite high value.


[19-Feb-19 05:29 AM] arweave-martin#1169
I think the timeout happens at 5s.


[19-Feb-19 05:30 AM] gucceed#9385
Its an i5core.What does this mean for me


[19-Feb-19 05:36 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@Mazzz I quickly checked the code. It makes the assumption that everything is stored on the same filesystem, so the limit of disk space used doens't work with symlinks. I would recommend you to not enable the `disk_space` limit and just make sure you have enough free space.


[19-Feb-19 05:41 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@gucceed Homebrew didn't link erlang@20 for you since it's keg only (which it says in the output). I force-link it on my Macs like this: `brew link erlang@20 --force`


[19-Feb-19 05:42 AM] Mazzz#1871
@arweave-martin  Ah so that was the problem. Thanks, I'll keep that in mind next time. But I already re-partitioned the drive and mounted the partitions onto the the large folders in the arweave directory and that seemed to have fixed it


[19-Feb-19 05:44 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@courtcircuit It's much better to make your node accessible directly by other nodes than running in polling mode. Can you open up port 1984 on you Internet IP address so it goes to your miner? In that case you don't need polling mode and shouldn't use it. You can also choose another port with the `port x` argument to `arweave-server`.


[19-Feb-19 06:14 AM] arweave-lev#3466
> I force-link it on my Macs like this

Ah, yes! I will update the guide with the `--force` option

@Vilenarios hey, were you successful in moving blocks between servers?


[19-Feb-19 07:02 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Yea but I just transferred from my Windows server using winscp


[19-Feb-19 07:03 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I had to make sure my account had owner rights over arweave folder using chown


[19-Feb-19 07:03 AM] prk#3209
Ok so you transferred between two physical miners I guess

Ya one windows server and one unbuntu server


[19-Feb-19 07:09 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I used this same method to transfer to my cloud miner a while back


[19-Feb-19 07:14 AM] prk#3209
Did this transfer take much time?


[19-Feb-19 07:34 AM] Vilenarios#8742

[19-Feb-19 07:34 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Could have used usb stick, or just attached the drive to one of my other rigs and copied directly


[19-Feb-19 07:35 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Zipping up the files also gives massive compression benefits since it’s all Json files


[19-Feb-19 07:36 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I’m lazy so the ol drag and drop with winscp worked fine

I recommend rsync over ssh. You can easily abort and continue. No need to create a huge zip-file. Supports compression.

[19-Feb-19 11:11 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Because of the way that the Arweave proof of access system works, miners are favourably rewarded for offering hard drive space above raw hashing power, meaning that efficient miners will optimise on this variable first. You can find out more about mining optimisation here: https://docs.arweave.org/info/mining/optimisation-tips

[19-Feb-19 11:16 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
It's actually port forwarding which is the issue here @nijntje , not your internet connection. We will revise the copy on this warning message. You can address this by configuring port forwarding on your router and ensuring that port 1984 is not blocked by your firewall :blockchain:


[19-Feb-19 11:16 AM] nijntje#0173
I had read that .... but do I actually need to do anything to optimise?

@yidakee you do not have the current recall block so the node could not start mining. Your node should be downloading blocks now.

where can we see current hash rate?


[21-Feb-19 05:52 PM] ivhturp#3325
We cannot @Lasse Clausen


[22-Feb-19 02:43 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@Lasse Clausen You can easily see the difficulty here: https://viewblock.io/arweave/blocks


[22-Feb-19 02:45 AM] arweave-martin#1169
The difficulty is the required number of leading zero bits in the hash. Ergo, the current difficulty of 33 means on avarage 4.3B hashes per block.


[22-Feb-19 04:38 AM] yidakee#3414
I dont understand why I am not mining. Its been 20h since I started, and always only seem to get could_not_start_mining - This is a quad core VPS with 180 GB free space SSD - any ideas?


[22-Feb-19 04:53 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@yidakee at`http://127.0.0.1:1984/info` you can see the number of blocks your node has downloaded to date (`"blocks": ...`) and the total number of blocks produced (`"height": ...`). Your node should download more blocks over time; 180 GB is more than enough at the moment.


[22-Feb-19 05:02 AM] Vilenarios#8742
So now that we have multi port


[22-Feb-19 05:02 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Does the wildfire score take that into account?


[22-Feb-19 05:03 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Or is it still by overall IP address, meaning if I have a few nodes behind single IP with multi port do they share the same wildfire score?


[22-Feb-19 05:04 AM] arweave-lev#3466
A new port corresponds to a new wildfire score. 2 ports on the same IP are considered to be 2 different addresses.


[22-Feb-19 05:14 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Makes sense. And wildfire score only affects acceptance of new blocks mined on network? Or does it also lower overall chance of mining a new block?


[22-Feb-19 05:27 AM] arweave-lev#3466
No, it does not affect mining itself. It's only about learning about new blocks (mined by others) faster.


[22-Feb-19 05:37 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Ah ha okay. I’m just a trying to figure out why my new miner ain’t mining blocks but this all makes sense. I’ll steal my other port/score


[22-Feb-19 06:06 AM] yidakee#3414
@arweave-lev  - yeah, though I dont need the /info ... just IP:1984 works fine

``` "network": "arweave.N.1",
"version": 5,
"release": 20,
"height": 145643,
"current": "g8Iibof67AiDhEjvEp291ZRg1FOU9iyDF68xVKgtA0FLNbcwKd9I8ZvQ73eCMxCE",
"blocks": 16464,
"peers": 51,
"queue_length": 0,
"node_state_latency": 15 ```

So the number of downloaded blocks (despite being up to height) has influence on when I actually start mining ?


[22-Feb-19 06:07 AM] yidakee#3414

arweave (2) 

[22-Feb-19 06:11 AM] arweave-lev#3466
yes, because a random block from the past is required to mine a block


[22-Feb-19 11:08 AM] necovx#5167
Does this support GPUs?


[22-Feb-19 11:16 AM] necovx#5167
If not, what would be an ideal machine setup?


[22-Feb-19 12:20 PM] arweave-sophie#4476
The hashing algorithm used underneath the proof of access mechanism in the Arweave is SHA2-384, for which the CPU is the most efficient miner currently available. So essentially, miners should focus first on storage, then on hashing. We also intend to move to genprog which will render GPUs ineffective @necovx

Newbie question, when I have downloaded the keyfile. Is my mining-address the same as arweave-keyfile-<MINING-ADDRESS>.json?


[23-Feb-19 10:21 AM] yidakee#3414
It can be any address, IIRC


[23-Feb-19 10:22 AM] ivhturp#3325
When you don't mention address, new keyfile is generated and same address is used AFAIK. You are right w.r.t address in file name. To verify, you can import the keyfile in chrome extension as well


[23-Feb-19 10:22 AM] yidakee#3414
@arweave-lev  48h in, and still not mining - just checking to see if this is normal

[23-Feb-19 10:24 AM] ivhturp#3325
It should be mining @yidakee . Your node had joined network successfully


[23-Feb-19 10:25 AM] ivhturp#3325
Note that your node has a chance to mine only 32236/146383 approx 20% times


[23-Feb-19 10:25 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@yidakee You have around 20% of the blocks, so you would be mining on every 5th block on average.


[23-Feb-19 10:26 AM] arweave-martin#1169
Oh, @ivhturp was quicker to reply than me  


[23-Feb-19 10:26 AM] arweave-martin#1169
What does the CPU usage plot over time say?


[23-Feb-19 10:31 AM] yidakee#3414
I've just been checking on and off, not registering - but started now with tload. With htop, I sometimes see 3 cores pegged to 100% for short bursts... Alright, thanks. Guess I need more time to get the full gist of this new mining algo    Thanks gents


[23-Feb-19 01:31 PM] yidakee#3414
Sweet - got some mining rewards 🤑


[23-Feb-19 02:12 PM] Marcin#0065
:) @yidakee


[23-Feb-19 02:50 PM] raphexion#3535
@ivhturp  Thank you  


[24-Feb-19 04:55 AM] Mazzz#1871
has anyone tried moving the large files to a remote location away from the miner?


[24-Feb-19 04:55 AM] Mazzz#1871
would it produce too much latency?


[24-Feb-19 04:55 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I haven’t yet. What large files are there though?


[24-Feb-19 05:00 AM] Mazzz#1871
wallet_lists and blocks


[24-Feb-19 05:14 AM] Vilenarios#8742
So where you thinking of putting it? On a NAS?


[24-Feb-19 05:15 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I don’t see why it wouldn’t work.... there aren’t any minimum storage latency requirements as far as I know.


[24-Feb-19 05:15 AM] Vilenarios#8742
This is something I’ve been meaning to test but I haven’t gotten around to it.


[24-Feb-19 05:15 AM] Mazzz#1871
@Vilenarios  Probably, it would be much more efficient to store all the data on one location, with all the miners feeding off of the location


[24-Feb-19 05:15 AM] Mazzz#1871
Same, I just can't afford it atm haha


[24-Feb-19 05:16 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I know the team wants to come up with a new storage pool mode


[24-Feb-19 05:16 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Something more of a traditional Database thatmultiple front ends can connect to


[24-Feb-19 05:17 AM] Vilenarios#8742
As of now, you could probably store your blocks on a remote location but I don’t think multiple miners will be able to write at the same time.


[24-Feb-19 05:17 AM] Mazzz#1871
hmm thats interesting


[24-Feb-19 05:17 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Storage pools will be necessary if the blockweave gets to be massive


[24-Feb-19 05:17 AM] Mazzz#1871
I don't think they really need to write  if the blocks are up to date


[24-Feb-19 05:17 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Or else only huge miners with expensive  big Storage area networks will survive


[24-Feb-19 05:18 AM] Mazzz#1871
I mean thats what usually happens on decentralised systems haha


[24-Feb-19 05:18 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Maybe the team can comment if they have simply tried multiple miners hitting the same fileshare for block data.


[24-Feb-19 05:19 AM] Mazzz#1871
yeah,  maybe I'd try that with my cloud servers later on


[24-Feb-19 05:20 AM] Mazzz#1871
Also @Vilenarios  do you think it's normal getting about 60AR per day with 16 cores?


[24-Feb-19 05:22 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Honestly man I have no clue anymore. I’ve been trying to measure different cpus and hashrates


[24-Feb-19 05:23 AM] Vilenarios#8742
And the results just aren’t consistent


[24-Feb-19 05:23 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I do think 60 AR for 16 cores is good though


[24-Feb-19 05:23 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Is it 16 core/32 thread?


[24-Feb-19 05:23 AM] Vilenarios#8742
What type of cpu?


[24-Feb-19 05:24 AM] Vilenarios#8742
My 16 thread ryzen maybe gets a block a day


[24-Feb-19 05:24 AM] Vilenarios#8742
My 4 thread azure cloud miner maybe gets a block a day


[24-Feb-19 05:24 AM] Vilenarios#8742
My 24 thread i7-7920x also maybe gets a block a day now


[24-Feb-19 05:24 AM] Vilenarios#8742
So it’s just reeeeallly hit or miss.


[24-Feb-19 05:25 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Especially if you are a new miner and your wildfire score is low, that hurts your chances a bit. But idk if your wildfire score ever maxes out or if ur just keeps getting higher and higher.


[24-Feb-19 05:26 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I’ll release my Feb numbers later this week.


[24-Feb-19 07:50 AM] Mazzz#1871
@Vilenarios ah so it's not bad. Your numbers don't look too bad either, I'd expect your i7-2920x to perform better though


[24-Feb-19 07:52 AM] Mazzz#1871
Is it on wifi? I found that when my desktop has a high latency, it usually mines less blocks


[24-Feb-19 07:57 AM] Mazzz#1871
But I'm mining on Google cloud and azure at the moment. 8 vcpus on each


[24-Feb-19 08:10 AM] ivhturp#3325
@Vilenarios Does wildfire score really have a significance now? I mean, with 600 nodes, I am not sure this score is compared for accepting the blocks. @arweave-martin Could you please confirm. If a node receives a block  A of height H from node of wildfire score 10 and it also receives a block B of same height H from node of wildire score 100 after 1 minute, which block is accepted? Could you please help us understand with some examples
All my nodes are on dynamic IPs - And my rewards have been decreasing day by day even though difficulty is the same 32 to 34 most of the times. Is the reason possibly wildfire scores?


[24-Feb-19 11:21 AM] yidakee#3414
where can I check on the wildfire score?


[24-Feb-19 11:47 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I don’t think you can


[24-Feb-19 11:47 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Nodes maintain wildfire scores for all of the other nodes they connect with


[24-Feb-19 11:48 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Which means, if I understand it properly, you actually have up to X number of different wildfire scores where X is number of nodes on the network.


[25-Feb-19 02:33 AM] awkweird#6550
Connected back my pc at my home. The mining is running smoothly.


[25-Feb-19 02:34 AM] awkweird#6550
But i have noticed that some blocks I’ve produced is not confirmed by the network. So it doesn’t go from 2/3 to 3/3.


[25-Feb-19 02:36 AM] awkweird#6550
Is it normal in this version? In the previous version it always get confirmed in the network.


[25-Feb-19 02:48 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@ivhturp

When a new block is mined, the node takes the first 10 best peers and sends the block to all of them in parallel. Afterward, it sends the block to rest of its peers one by one, in the wildfire score order. The motivation behind it is to make nodes mutually benefit from the good behavior - if you send your blocks and transactions promptly to others, they will do the same to you. Every node is interested in receiving blocks as fast as possible so that it can mine on top of the most relevant block.

When you receive a block, the wildfire score of the sender does not make a difference.

Note that difficulty 34 makes it 4 times harder to mine compared to difficulty 32. The network has grown a little so the difficulty might be 33 or 34 more often, what would explain the decreasing rewards.

Hope it helps.


[25-Feb-19 03:00 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@awkweird

Your block(s) have probably been orphaned. It happens every once in a while when two miners mine two blocks around the same time. One of those two gets abandoned by the network.


[25-Feb-19 03:31 AM] awkweird#6550
Damn it happens too often, rejected twice so far.


[25-Feb-19 03:34 AM] awkweird#6550
Also, the difficulty seems increased significantly? Used to find at least 3 blocks in 2 days but its only 1 block in a day


[25-Feb-19 03:34 AM] awkweird#6550
Sad


[25-Feb-19 06:40 AM] ivhturp#3325
@arweave-lev Thanks for the explanation. I always thought wildfire score was used the other way i.e., when block is received. Makes sense  


[25-Feb-19 11:14 AM] Vilenarios#8742
@arweave-lev is it possible to connect to peers directly over non-standard ports?


[25-Feb-19 11:16 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@Vilenarios What do you mean by "connect to peers"?


[25-Feb-19 11:17 AM] Vilenarios#8742
When I start my miner


[25-Feb-19 11:17 AM] Vilenarios#8742
And you put in the list of addresses for your peers


[25-Feb-19 11:17 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I’d like to have all of my nodes peering with one another but since I have multiple nodes on multiple ports behind a single IP, how can I accomplish this?


[25-Feb-19 11:18 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Or should I just use the internal IP, ie 192.168.1.whatever


[25-Feb-19 11:18 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@Vilenarios Sure! Just add a colon and the port number. E.g. like this: `123.123.123.123:2000`


[25-Feb-19 11:18 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Ahh duh okay. I’ll try that


[25-Feb-19 11:20 AM] arweave-martin#1169
And you should use the internet IP address if possible.


[25-Feb-19 11:28 AM] arweave-martin#1169
...since then other nodes can find them and send blocks to them.


[25-Feb-19 11:45 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Ya definitely. So I’ll use my public but with multiple ports.


[25-Feb-19 11:46 AM] Vilenarios#8742
But I guess that peer list is only used for joining? Or will it always use those in the 10 “best peers” list?


[25-Feb-19 11:49 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@Vilenarios Yes, it's only for joining. During joining the node will use that peer list for finding more nodes.


[25-Feb-19 11:50 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Ah got it.


[25-Feb-19 02:57 PM] arweave-martin#1169
And then it will continue to find new nodes every now and then of course and kick out the ones will lower score, according to Wildfire.


[25-Feb-19 05:30 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Does wildfire start from 0 every time a node restarts?


[26-Feb-19 02:26 AM] arweave-lev#3466
Other nodes do not reset your score if you restart, but the restarting node's scores will be reset and recomputed after a restart.


[26-Feb-19 03:44 AM] arweave-martin#1169
So basically, you only harm other nodes scores by restarting your node. But, since the other nodes like your node already (and are sending it blocks and transactions), your node will soon like them back.


[26-Feb-19 08:12 AM] tiamat#9131
@arweave-martin what stops a node to ask another node for the recall block right before PoW ?


[27-Feb-19 12:52 PM] yidakee#3414
Seem weird I got a mining reward last Saturday, but never again since. Got a quad core with 170GB VPS going

Its so random. I sometimes find nothing for 3-4 days or 3-4 blocks in a single day


[27-Feb-19 11:47 PM] ATLAS#7218
Its in the nature to be random. Even if coin flip has 50% chance to be either side, there can be consecutive tails/heads. Nothing can be done in this regard.

[28-Feb-19 12:43 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
I have approx 52 coins per day for 1 server


[28-Feb-19 01:14 AM] Mazzz#1871
how many cores?


[28-Feb-19 01:15 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@Mazzz 16 per each server


[28-Feb-19 01:15 AM] Mazzz#1871
yeah I get about the same with google compute and azure


[28-Feb-19 01:15 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
It's very expensive server...


[28-Feb-19 01:16 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@Mazzz What is your price for this VPS?


[28-Feb-19 01:18 AM] Mazzz#1871
It's about $400USD per month for 16 cores


[28-Feb-19 01:18 AM] Mazzz#1871
it's not really a vps


[28-Feb-19 01:19 AM] Mazzz#1871
but I'm using the $400 free trial money haha


[28-Feb-19 01:19 AM] Mazzz#1871
so I'm mining for free at the moment until it expires


[28-Feb-19 01:20 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
What is the cost of each coin ??


[28-Feb-19 01:53 AM] Marcin#0065
The very moment, when rewards will drop in summer, im curious how many miner will stay


[28-Feb-19 02:25 AM] ivhturp#3325
Any idea how much do they reduce to @Marcin ?
If AR goes to any exchange with a decent price, i believe miners will continue. However, in case there is no exchange, I am sure many existing miners will drop well before summer 😩


[28-Feb-19 02:45 AM] Marcin#0065
We will see :)
Any developer is welcome to create cool stuff onto the arweave


[28-Feb-19 09:58 AM] Vilenarios#8742
@Mazzz what free trial?


[28-Feb-19 03:32 PM] Mazzz#1871
@Vilenarios Google compute and azure give you $200 worth of free trial


[28-Feb-19 03:43 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Woa 200$ per email address?


[28-Feb-19 03:43 PM] notjeff(jeff)#8945
what prevents them from pocketing your private keys?


[28-Feb-19 03:43 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Their entire reputation


[28-Feb-19 03:44 PM] Vilenarios#8742
And those big cloud providers have a lot of controls that block their own admins from logging into your shit


[28-Feb-19 03:44 PM] Vilenarios#8742
But yeah it’s a valid question and one of the biggest thing that is preventing my large enterprise company from using more cloud


[28-Feb-19 04:57 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@notjeff(jeff) Private keys? From what wallet? Or from what service?


[01-Mar-19 12:21 AM] tiamat#9131
@notjeff(jeff) you don't need to put your private key on the miner


[01-Mar-19 12:54 AM] Mazzz#1871
@Vilenarios unfortunately you need to verify your phone and card details. They even need verification if they suspect fraud. So it's pretty hard to game the system  


[02-Mar-19 02:33 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Darn.


[02-Mar-19 02:33 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Well I decided to bump my cloud vm to 32 core with max miner 30. Let’s see how it does.


[02-Mar-19 02:33 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Only gonna run it for a couple days cuz it’s way expensive.


[03-Mar-19 04:12 AM] Dentechr#5213
Guys is it possible to run 2 miners on 1 network with one external ip adress ?


[03-Mar-19 04:40 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@Dentechr  you can the second (third, etc) one on a different port. Specify a custom port in the command line: `arweave-server port <CUSTOM_PORT (e.g. 1983)> ...`.


[03-Mar-19 05:44 AM] Dentechr#5213
Thanks !


[03-Mar-19 05:44 AM] Dentechr#5213
Can i use the same Arweave adress on both nodes ?


[03-Mar-19 05:48 AM] arweave-lev#3466
yep


[03-Mar-19 07:49 AM] awkweird#6550
About 700 nodes connected atm. Almost two folds when I checked two months ago.


[03-Mar-19 07:58 AM] Marcin#0065
whats the simple command to just update the miner with git? to be on the most current version with the newest commits?


[03-Mar-19 08:02 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I wonder how many nodes are mining to the same addresss


[03-Mar-19 08:02 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Specially these addresses that mine 4 or 5 blocks in a row.


[03-Mar-19 08:03 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Is it by design to be able to generate “hot streaks”?


[03-Mar-19 10:52 AM] Dentechr#5213
Thanks guys
I got a gpu rig mining a different coin but it has an i9 chip doing almost nothing, so i figured AR !!


[03-Mar-19 01:42 PM] Vilenarios#8742
May as well especially while block rewards are high and disk utilization is low!


[03-Mar-19 02:23 PM] Dentechr#5213
How do i add this in command line


[03-Mar-19 02:23 PM] Dentechr#5213
./arweave-server port <CUSTOM_PORT 1983> ?


[03-Mar-19 03:16 PM] arweave-lev#3466
`./arweave-server port 1983 ...` but replace `...` with everything what follows `arweave-server` in the mining guide.


[03-Mar-19 11:35 PM] tiamat#9131
what's up with the forks at 151640 and 150226 ? 12 nodes and 4 nodes


[04-Mar-19 01:38 AM] Marcin#0065
I checked my node 10 minutes ago. And i had a lot messages about accepted blocks (which is unusual). But the reward sum in viewblock hasnt changed. What could happend?

I did fetched all new, landed an 1.6.2.0 RC2 now and restarted, but was in hurry and didnt check if all went smooth.

Weird behvior


[04-Mar-19 01:51 AM] Marcin#0065
I guess some kind of desync


[04-Mar-19 03:44 AM] arweave-lev#3466
Yes, it looks like a small group of nodes de-synced around that point. If your miner is one of those, you need to restart your node. We are looking into the cause.


[04-Mar-19 08:17 AM] Marcin#0065
So how can i know, if my miner is in sync atm? It all looked normal to me. Only the checkup with the actual reward sum showed me, that something is not correct


[04-Mar-19 08:21 AM] arweave-lev#3466
Viewblock currently shows the correct height (152155). But a better reference point is probably our nodes recommended as peers in the mining guide.


[04-Mar-19 08:23 AM] Marcin#0065
Okay. Will be checking more often now


[04-Mar-19 08:23 AM] Marcin#0065
I cant tell for how long the miner went desynced

Thanks Yikadee


[06-Mar-19 04:32 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-martin This is new miner?


[06-Mar-19 04:33 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@slayer_hellraiser I'm sorry, but I don't understand your question. Which one is what?


[06-Mar-19 04:34 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-martin You wrote about ATH, i asked: This is a new miner (human, not software)?


[06-Mar-19 04:35 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
I meant that a new miner came and added his servers


[06-Mar-19 04:36 AM] arweave-martin#1169
We don't know who are running which nodes. But, today there were a bunch of new similar IP addresses, so it seems like someone launched a bunch of nodes. Every day there are nodes coming and going.


[06-Mar-19 04:37 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Ok, i understand


[06-Mar-19 04:37 AM] arweave-martin#1169
It's not unusual that someone launches a bunch of nodes though.


[06-Mar-19 07:29 AM] Marcin#0065
Ath=all time high @slayer_hellraiser


[06-Mar-19 07:38 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@Marcin i know, man


[06-Mar-19 10:03 AM] arweave-lev#3466
Today we are happy to announce the release 1.6.2.0 of the Arweave Node!

We have
- Significantly increased the efficiency of block and transaction propagation.
- Sped up the fork recovery process.
- Added a `GET /wallet/[Addr]/deposits` endpoint for fetching incoming transfers for a wallet. For more details, see https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/blob/N.1.6.2.0/http_iface_docs.md.
- Fixed a bug in the `POST /unsigned_tx` endpoint where it required irrelevant data. The updated endpoint documentation is at https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/blob/N.1.6.2.0/http_post_unsigned_tx_docs.md.
- Made various reliability improvements.

Upgrade instructions:

1. Shut down `arweave-server`.
2. `git fetch --all --tags && git checkout master && git reset --hard N.1.6.2.0`
3. Start `arweave-server` again with the same arguments as before.

For more details on how to run the node, please see our mining guide -
https://docs.arweave.org/info/mining/mining-guide.

Pay attention to the recommended list of peers. It has not been updated since the last release. These peers are all operated by the Arweave organization.

And a little bonus for those willing to contribute - we have prepared a simple guide for external contributors - https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md, check it out!


[06-Mar-19 10:11 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@here See the release notes above.


[06-Mar-19 10:22 AM] Marcin#0065
But why i haf 1.6.2.0 2 days ago already when fetching? Weird.

Ill do it again now


[06-Mar-19 10:24 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@Marcin The tag `N.1.6.2.0` was created less than an hour ago. We did a couple of release candidate tags (N.1.6.2.0-RC1, N.1.6.2.0-RC2) recently.


[06-Mar-19 10:25 AM] Marcin#0065
ahhh yeah, it was RC2


[06-Mar-19 12:23 PM] yidakee#3414
updated to 1.6.2.0


[06-Mar-19 05:45 PM] Vilenarios#8742
So does wildfire score take into account available storage on the node?  Like a node with 10TB would rank higher than a node with 64GB


[07-Mar-19 02:35 AM] arweave-lev#3466
It is problematic to prove to others that you have certain amount of space available. But even then, why do you want to assign higher scores to such nodes?


[07-Mar-19 04:29 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Well I guess I’m thinking more about overall network capacity management


[07-Mar-19 04:30 AM] Vilenarios#8742
We got 1.5GB on the weave now. Is it possible to know how much potential storage is available across all nodes?


[07-Mar-19 04:31 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Or is it a similar unknown like total hashrate


[07-Mar-19 04:33 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@Vilenarios The nodes don't report their available disk space at all. The total hashrate you can calculate from the difficulty though, just as in other blockchains with hash based PoW.


[07-Mar-19 05:05 AM] Dragos#3606
I am mining for around 12 hours. its normal to be still 0 my balance ?

@Dragos  yeah, took me 2 days before I got a reward - and then 2 weeks without any, but node count has also gone way up too


[07-Mar-19 05:06 AM] Dragos#3606
ok. just to be sure I am on the right track at least


[07-Mar-19 05:06 AM] Vilenarios#8742
It all depends on how much of the blockchain you have downloaded

@Dragos  http:/uourIP:1984

around 30-40 blocks


[07-Mar-19 05:07 AM] Dragos#3606
i saw the message with hashing a while ago


[07-Mar-19 05:07 AM] yidakee#3414
you should see something like

```

[07-Mar-19 04:05 PM] BisonAaron#0172
hi, i am working to get an arweave miner running. Just curious if other people have seen this error come up in the logs -- could_not_start_mining stored_recall_block_for_foreign_verification


[07-Mar-19 04:42 PM] Marcin#0065
@BisonAaronlooks good, dont worry


[07-Mar-19 04:43 PM] Marcin#0065
You just didnt had the random recall blocl


[07-Mar-19 04:43 PM] BisonAaron#0172
kk


[07-Mar-19 04:43 PM] BisonAaron#0172
over time this will go away


[07-Mar-19 04:43 PM] BisonAaron#0172
i guess


[07-Mar-19 04:43 PM] BisonAaron#0172
it seems to be syncing pretty slowly


[07-Mar-19 04:43 PM] Marcin#0065
The  more block you own, the higher is the probability to start mining


[07-Mar-19 04:43 PM] BisonAaron#0172
3.6gb --> 3.7gb over like 30 minutes


[07-Mar-19 04:43 PM] BisonAaron#0172
does it take long to sync?


[07-Mar-19 04:43 PM] Marcin#0065
Haha


[07-Mar-19 04:43 PM] Marcin#0065
Its good


[07-Mar-19 04:44 PM] Marcin#0065
It used to be weeks


[07-Mar-19 04:44 PM] Marcin#0065
Now should be days


[07-Mar-19 04:44 PM] BisonAaron#0172
ok, i imagine it will fill up the space


[07-Mar-19 04:44 PM] BisonAaron#0172
until it can't


[07-Mar-19 04:44 PM] Marcin#0065
Yes


[07-Mar-19 04:44 PM] BisonAaron#0172
ok


[07-Mar-19 04:44 PM] Marcin#0065
As long you didnt specify a limit


[07-Mar-19 04:44 PM] BisonAaron#0172
i didn't


[07-Mar-19 04:44 PM] BisonAaron#0172
i have ~1tb


[07-Mar-19 04:44 PM] BisonAaron#0172
so i figured


[07-Mar-19 04:44 PM] Marcin#0065
It will take all free space on disk.


[07-Mar-19 04:44 PM] BisonAaron#0172
just let it  go


[07-Mar-19 04:44 PM] BisonAaron#0172
ok


[07-Mar-19 04:44 PM] BisonAaron#0172
eventually  


[07-Mar-19 04:45 PM] BisonAaron#0172
ill just leave it alone


[07-Mar-19 04:45 PM] BisonAaron#0172
and look at it tomorrow


[07-Mar-19 04:45 PM] Marcin#0065
If u have many disks, it only takes the one, on which the arweave folder is o


[07-Mar-19 04:45 PM] Marcin#0065
On


[07-Mar-19 04:45 PM] BisonAaron#0172
yeah


[07-Mar-19 04:45 PM] BisonAaron#0172
the blockchain folder


[07-Mar-19 04:45 PM] BisonAaron#0172
or whatever it was called


[07-Mar-19 04:45 PM] BisonAaron#0172
inside the repo


[07-Mar-19 04:45 PM] Marcin#0065
Blockweave ;)


[07-Mar-19 04:45 PM] BisonAaron#0172
`blocks`


[07-Mar-19 04:45 PM] BisonAaron#0172
yes my b


[07-Mar-19 04:45 PM] Marcin#0065
Tx, wallets, blocks


[07-Mar-19 04:45 PM] BisonAaron#0172
 


[07-Mar-19 04:46 PM] Marcin#0065
Let it go for some days. Hopefully u can get some


[07-Mar-19 04:46 PM] BisonAaron#0172
kk cool


[07-Mar-19 04:46 PM] Marcin#0065
Until approx june there are much higher rewards


[07-Mar-19 04:46 PM] BisonAaron#0172
im evaluating the network a bit, very curious


[07-Mar-19 04:46 PM] BisonAaron#0172
so i shouldn't see much cpu usage


[07-Mar-19 04:46 PM] Marcin#0065
Its still all on very small scale


[07-Mar-19 04:46 PM] BisonAaron#0172
until i actually have the random verification block


[07-Mar-19 04:47 PM] BisonAaron#0172
more frequently


[07-Mar-19 04:47 PM] Marcin#0065
It takes 100% cpu on every core /thread


[07-Mar-19 04:47 PM] Marcin#0065
Try to set a limit of around 2-3 Threads less than you maximun


[07-Mar-19 04:48 PM] Marcin#0065
The very moment it starts hashing, the sync calculation is very slow. Leave some threads free for all the background processes


[07-Mar-19 04:49 PM] BisonAaron#0172
kk


[07-Mar-19 04:49 PM] BisonAaron#0172
but that will only be when i have more of these checks


[07-Mar-19 04:49 PM] BisonAaron#0172
as long as it says `could_not_start_mining`


[07-Mar-19 04:50 PM] BisonAaron#0172
i won't see any pegged cpus?


[08-Mar-19 03:11 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@BisonAaron Welcome!   The logfile is not only for errors, so you will see a lot of information showing up there. Unfortunately, it's hard to distinguish between what is an error and what is not by looking in the logfile, but we're improving on this over time.


[08-Mar-19 06:37 AM] yidakee#3414
How do I limit CPU threads? I think I remember by default it will start -1. Have a quad-core, and trying to figure out hie to optimise mining. Not having a good experience. Got one reward two days in, and zero two weeks after. Is this normal?


[08-Mar-19 07:46 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@yidakee Use the `max_miners` startup argument. E.g. `./arweave-server mine peer x.x.x.xx max_miners 2`


[08-Mar-19 07:46 AM] arweave-martin#1169
If it's consuming all available CPU already, then you should be fine.


[08-Mar-19 11:43 AM] Dentechr#5213
In my experience it's best not to use al threads as it will effect your latency


[08-Mar-19 11:44 AM] Dentechr#5213
Anybody able to help out with the best way to add another hdd to my system?
I bought an extra 2tb drive but it doesnt show up in my folder


[08-Mar-19 11:52 AM] yidakee#3414
checked with htop and I got 3 CPU doing work and one free. Dont get it, I really think I should've gotten more rewards by now


[08-Mar-19 12:03 PM] arweave-martin#1169
@Dentechr @yidakee In the latest release there is an improvement reducing the priority of the mining processes, so the latency should be less affected when mining with many cores.


[08-Mar-19 12:05 PM] arweave-martin#1169
@yidakee Try setting `max_miners 4` and see how it behaves. As long as the `node_state_latency` metric on the `/info` endpoint doesn't increase much, then it should be fine.


[08-Mar-19 12:09 PM] Dentechr#5213
Great to hear martin! 
Before the ideal amout for me was to use 25 of my 32 threads.
I will try 30 tonight

{Reactions}
  

[08-Mar-19 03:29 PM] yidakee#3414
@arweave-martin  re-started with 4 miners, lets see.  before ``` "node_state_latency": 1317 ```


[08-Mar-19 03:37 PM] arweave-martin#1169
node_state_latency is in microseconds btw, so 1317 is only 1.3ms


[08-Mar-19 04:23 PM] vitosfizik#9289
After upgrading the miner, the processor is not at all loaded, is this normal?


[09-Mar-19 01:28 AM] vitosfizik#9289
And always "could_not_start_mining", only at start once "node_start_mining".


[09-Mar-19 01:45 AM] Dragos#3606
after 2 days of mining i got 32 AR   its good ? its bad ?  


[09-Mar-19 04:50 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@vitosfizik The reason it didn't start should also be in the log. The most common reason is that you don't have the recall block.


[09-Mar-19 04:51 AM] arweave-martin#1169
Did you delete the blocks on disk during the update?


[09-Mar-19 07:50 AM] vitosfizik#9289
No


[09-Mar-19 07:54 AM] vitosfizik#9289
I have already reinstalled the system (ubuntu) and installed a new miner, the same error.


[09-Mar-19 08:54 AM] Vilenarios#8742
@Dragos it depends on how many cpus u have. For 4 core 32 AR every day or two is good.


[09-Mar-19 11:15 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@vitosfizik Then it's most likely because you don't have the recall block. It's not an error. It can only mine if it has the recall block. Since you deleted all blocks, it will take a week or so until all blocks are downloaded again.


[09-Mar-19 11:19 AM] vitosfizik#9289
Is it possible to somehow download all the blocks faster?


[09-Mar-19 11:25 AM] arweave-martin#1169
You can copy them between multiple nodes (while the nodes are stopped)


[09-Mar-19 11:27 AM] vitosfizik#9289
And on the other device, I did not delete anything, just updated the miner, and the result is the same.


[09-Mar-19 11:32 AM] vitosfizik#9289
Those. until all the blocks are downloaded, the mining is not going, just downloading blocks and therefore the CPU is not loaded?


[09-Mar-19 11:35 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@vitosfizik Then I misunderstood you. What does the "blocks" metric say when you browse to `/info` on your miner?


[09-Mar-19 11:35 AM] arweave-martin#1169
"blocks" is the number of blocks on disk


[09-Mar-19 11:36 AM] arweave-martin#1169
And again, the reason for "could_not_start_mining" is also in the log.


[09-Mar-19 11:49 AM] vitosfizik#9289
could_not_start_mining
stored_recall_block_for_foreign_verification
This is how it writes in the log


[09-Mar-19 12:23 PM] vitosfizik#9289
In the Blocks folder there are 43,585 files


[09-Mar-19 12:26 PM] vitosfizik#9289
When I looked /info in the miner, I did not find anything about the "blocks"


[09-Mar-19 01:52 PM] vitosfizik#9289
And how many blocks need to download?


[09-Mar-19 03:45 PM] Marcin#0065
Currently its around 155k blocks


[09-Mar-19 03:46 PM] Marcin#0065
You can check the current heigh here:
https://viewblock.io/arweave/blocks


[09-Mar-19 04:10 PM] vitosfizik#9289
Thank you!


[09-Mar-19 04:44 PM] vitosfizik#9289
But I understand that in the old version of the miner the presence of so many blocks was not necessary? Otherwise, how to explain the fact that before the update the computer brought me a stable 1 block per day, and now for the third day it just downloads the blocks?


[09-Mar-19 06:43 PM] Marcin#0065
If more poeple join the network for mining, its gettinf harder


[09-Mar-19 07:39 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Difficulty is still 33


[09-Mar-19 07:39 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Doesn’t seem to go pst 35


[10-Mar-19 03:23 AM] vitosfizik#9289
Why is the complexity of the network? I say that on all devices all blocks were not loaded and without any problems they brought coins on the old version of the miner, and after the update everything stopped abruptly.


[10-Mar-19 03:24 AM] vitosfizik#9289
And you can roll back to the old version?


[10-Mar-19 07:16 AM] Mazzz#1871
New miners! Tired of downloading blocks?  I will  send you all the files in a zip folder for a small fee


[10-Mar-19 07:27 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@Mazzz Payment in AR coins? ))

@slayer_hellraiser Dm me, we can work something out


[10-Mar-19 07:40 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@Mazzz Well, I myself made archives for myself, When it was not mainstream yet ..


[10-Mar-19 07:41 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
And I can put it directly on the arweave network, if you share some tokens to pay for the repository ))

@slayer_hellraiser haha I was the one trying to get paid

@vitosfizik the blocks were required in all versions of the software. Your nodes download blocks in the background, until all the blocks are downloaded or they fill up the available disk space.

Hey @Mazzz how large is the whole folder you’ve got?

I'm about to call it quits. Not really having the best of times figuring out arweave. 2.5 weeks without any reward with almost fully sync'ed blocks is not very stimulating


[12-Mar-19 05:32 AM] awkweird#6550

Port 1984 is open, as you can see by my pasted info above.  I got 1 reward 2 or 3 days in, and never again since - only thing I did was update to the newest version 1.6.2.0 mid-way


[12-Mar-19 06:37 AM] Marcin#0065
2.2 ghz is pretty low


[12-Mar-19 06:40 AM] Marcin#0065
Im running a 12 Core CPU with 4ghz each, on 20 Threads, and it gives around 1 Block a day. Maybe 1.5 Blocks/day.
A 4 Core @2.2 Ghz may give such low probability for mining a block


[12-Mar-19 06:44 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I gave up trying to figure it all out


[12-Mar-19 06:44 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I bought a whole new computer basically for my i7-7920x, run it on max miner 20 and I get the same amount of blocks per day as my 4 core cloud miner


[12-Mar-19 06:46 AM] Vilenarios#8742
My only miner which gets considerably less is my AMD ryzen build.


[12-Mar-19 06:51 AM] awkweird#6550
@yidakee seems like your clock speed is little bit low, my cpu is 3.6ghz each and run smoothly.


[12-Mar-19 06:51 AM] awkweird#6550
You have a fast connection right?


[12-Mar-19 06:53 AM] awkweird#6550
@Vilenarios maybe the pooling affects? Had some cloud mining with 12cpus and it got like 2-3 blocks a day when my pc was only finding one.


[12-Mar-19 06:54 AM] Vilenarios#8742
It must be something like that


[12-Mar-19 06:54 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I’m running multi port now


[12-Mar-19 06:54 AM] Vilenarios#8742
But maybe my Verizon router is struggling or something


[12-Mar-19 06:54 AM] awkweird#6550
Very curious about how far the team stack up. They once mentioned they run a miner with a very little hash power


[12-Mar-19 06:55 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Considered upgrading to gigabit network. Not sure if that would help me at all though.


[12-Mar-19 06:55 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Any of u guys running a gigabit network?


[12-Mar-19 06:55 AM] awkweird#6550
Would it worth upgrading to a gigabit network though


[12-Mar-19 06:55 AM] awkweird#6550
?

[12-Mar-19 06:56 AM] awkweird#6550
I have a 20$ subscription per month and i pay 30$ electric bill for the mining


[12-Mar-19 06:57 AM] awkweird#6550
And mined 1200 ish in average


[12-Mar-19 06:59 AM] awkweird#6550
So what if token price is less than $0.04, it would be bad for me


[12-Mar-19 06:59 AM] awkweird#6550
:/


[12-Mar-19 07:22 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Yeah honestly I don’t think it would be worth the upgrade. Bandwidth probably isn’t my limiting factor here.

haha 2500 AR not a big amount


[12-Mar-19 10:29 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Well, i see very expensive and very cheapest prices. I already can not surprise anything. The exchange will show the true price.

@sponnet something should be wrong with the Dockerfile. In fact, we do not use in development and do not mention it in the mining guide, sorry for the confusion. Please use the instructions from this guide to make the node up and running - https://docs.arweave.org/info/mining/mining-guide

[13-Mar-19 08:24 AM] sponnet#3069
can you tell me how I can see that the miner is working from the logfiles or the http API ? What should I be looking for ?


[13-Mar-19 08:24 AM] sponnet#3069

"node_state_latency": 48
}
```


[13-Mar-19 08:24 AM] sponnet#3069
the `not_joined` seems like a problem ? What should I normally see here ?


[13-Mar-19 08:27 AM] arweave-lev#3466
The node should be downloading the last 100 blocks, after they are downloaded, "not_joined" should go away.


[13-Mar-19 08:27 AM] sponnet#3069
also the Dockerfile seems to pull the latest commit from the repo - so I could assume that the version I'm running is the latest


[13-Mar-19 08:27 AM] sponnet#3069
https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/blob/master/Dockerfile#L21-L23


[13-Mar-19 08:28 AM] arweave-lev#3466
It uses the `stable` tag, which points to the latest release.


[13-Mar-19 08:28 AM] arweave-lev#3466
But I do not recommend using the Dockerfile.


[13-Mar-19 08:28 AM] sponnet#3069
I'll try to install it locally then to see if that makes a difference


[13-Mar-19 08:29 AM] sponnet#3069
btw do you see anything like a wrong erlang version or so - this is from within the docker container :

[13-Mar-19 08:31 AM] sponnet#3069
but as you suggested I;ll try to run it locally first.


[13-Mar-19 08:44 AM] arweave-lev#3466
At the moment we are preparing a new setup using Docker images (what a coincidence!  ), but with the goal of automating some network tests. So although we have a different plan for Docker (at least for now), you should be able to use a new setup to run the node when we finish it. But we encourage external contributions! And you do not have to wait for us and very welcome to contribute a patch to that Dockerfile or create a new one, which we might later decide how to align with what we are developing.


[13-Mar-19 08:48 AM] sponnet#3069
That sounds great.. I'm now running the miner locally to see the difference in output

it;s syncing blocks - let;s see when he gets >100


[13-Mar-19 08:50 AM] sponnet#3069
I see that it uses a newer erlang version ( Eshell V9.3.3.9  ) as compared to the docker


[13-Mar-19 08:53 AM] sponnet#3069
ok so the local version does seem to work - the `current` field now shows a value


[13-Mar-19 08:53 AM] sponnet#3069
let's see if I can make this thing work on docker too


[13-Mar-19 08:54 AM] sponnet#3069
do you think it shold run on `erts-9.2` or does it need 9.3.x ?


[13-Mar-19 08:59 AM] arweave-lev#3466
you need `Erlang/OTP 20` (which comes with a particular version of Eshell, but OTP 20 is what matters here)

What are the recommendations/requirements as far as bandwidth and storage for nodes?


[13-Mar-19 04:48 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Bandwidth I would say at least 25 mb connection up/down. More May be better but I have no clue how to test the differences.


[13-Mar-19 04:48 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Storage I’d say for now you only need 64GB really.


[13-Mar-19 04:49 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Once the weave grows then who knows.


[13-Mar-19 04:49 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I bought some 4TB 7200k rpm drives for my miners.


[13-Mar-19 04:50 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Arweave is all in a single folder so you will need some clever symbolic linking to actually spread it across multiple drives. I’ve yet to do this because no need really.


[13-Mar-19 04:50 PM] Vilenarios#8742
At some point I think the team wants to get to a storage pool/database model that should be more flexible.


[13-Mar-19 04:51 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I’d like to hear the teams response on bandwidth... since I’ve been wondering if it’s worthwhile to go gigabit.

@Vilenarios you probably should not worry about those much, but I can't tell for sure where they come from unless you post more logs from that time.


[14-Mar-19 11:01 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@sponnet would like to give you an update regarding

> At the moment we are preparing a new setup using Docker images but with the goal of automating some network tests.

We are reconsidering that due to the performance Docker displays on macs. So if you really want to use Docker for some reason, please consider creating a new image (should be pretty straightforward) or figuring out the way to use the old one we have in the repository. You are also welcome to contribute an update.


[14-Mar-19 01:16 PM] sponnet#3069
I did some tests - but cannot get the daemon to run in the docker yet. I can get it started by updating the `docker-arweave-server` to reflect whatever is in `arweave-server` but without the compile step (all this tools are not insttalled on the docker image )


[14-Mar-19 01:17 PM] sponnet#3069
butt so the server starts up - but then after waiting for 100 blocks instead of saying that he is connectted tto tthe network - he still gives the error:


[14-Mar-19 01:17 PM] sponnet#3069

[14-Mar-19 01:18 PM] sponnet#3069
can you explain why the server script contains this step :


[14-Mar-19 01:18 PM] sponnet#3069
```
    echo Building dependencies...
    ./bin/mute-on-success make all
```


[14-Mar-19 01:18 PM] sponnet#3069
before sttartting the server


[14-Mar-19 01:19 PM] sponnet#3069
https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/blob/master/arweave-server#L15-L16


[14-Mar-19 01:21 PM] arweave-lev#3466
This step builds (compiles) the miner code. `mute-on-success` cuts the non-error compilation logs off to make the output cleaner.


[14-Mar-19 01:23 PM] sponnet#3069
I see - the docker does a `make build` instead.. I assume this cannot be the reason for it not working - can it ?


[14-Mar-19 01:26 PM] arweave-lev#3466
It is almost the same. It's not clear how it leads to the logs above


[14-Mar-19 03:46 PM] sponnet#3069
Ill experiment some more


[14-Mar-19 03:47 PM] sponnet#3069
what was the performance issue with docker stated above? Is it too slow to start up for running tests - or does the docker affect the mining success ?


[14-Mar-19 03:48 PM] sponnet#3069
i.e. is it bad to run the server in a docker permanently


[15-Mar-19 01:52 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-martin @arweave-india @arweave-lev @arweave-stan So, there is a very interesting question.
To start introductory:
There are 6 groups of dedicated servers (not VPS), on which Arweave mining was launched at different times. The number of servers in each group is the same.
1 group started the very first 2 months ago, 6 group started a few days ago.
On all servers, the blocks and transactions was updated, currently the volume of the arweave folder is 54373 MB on each server.
Servers are absolutely identical, groups 4-6 have never even been in operation.
On all servers almost simultaneously similar entries appear in the log:
Friday, 06:22:11: [Stage 1/3] Successfully proved access to recall block. Starting to hash.
and it basically says that the probability of block extraction is the same on all servers (correct me if I'm wrong), and the size of the folder with the blocks is the same everywhere, the value of "height" and "blocks" are about the same on all servers. Servers are rebooted at the same time, if necessary, and mining is simultaneously launched on them. There are no downtime in mining, the average CPU load is about the same for each server.
The number of rewards from the moment of full synchronization of servers from 4-6 groups for a rather long period is uneven (although over a large period it should be approximately the same):
Group_1 = 9 blocks
Group_2 = 13 blocks
Group_3 = 9 blocks
Group_4 = 3 blocks
Group_5 = 2 blocks
Group_6 = 3 blocks

Actually the question:
How is the reward accrued, if the differences are only in the time of the total mining of each server? For some reason, in two absolutely identical server groups, the number of found blocks may differ by 4-6 times? Does the number of rewards depend on the total time of the server as a miner?
P.S.:I repeat, all servers are exactly the same.


[15-Mar-19 02:15 AM] ATLAS#7218
2 months and 2 blocks?


[15-Mar-19 02:16 AM] ATLAS#7218
If your hashrate is low, its like flipping coin 100 times and saying why is there 70 heads


[15-Mar-19 02:17 AM] ATLAS#7218
I had setups which had good hashrates and they found quite the same amount for their 3 months of operation.


[15-Mar-19 03:18 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@ATLAS No, not 2 blocks in 2 months. Read carefully. Two blocks from the time of full synchronization, in general, in a couple of days.


[15-Mar-19 03:19 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Not one server in each group


[15-Mar-19 07:53 AM] Mazzz#1871
Hi, why is a high RAM required to get good rewards? What would be the effects of having little ram?


[15-Mar-19 07:55 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I’d do 8GB of ram. Shouldn’t need mire than that.


[15-Mar-19 07:56 AM] Vilenarios#8742
4GB May work on u Ubuntu only. But the cost difference between 4 and 8 is pretty minimal.


[15-Mar-19 07:56 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Remember - in the end you are a web server AND a miner. So responding to requests is just as important.


[15-Mar-19 08:01 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Well, I have 16 GB of RAM on each server, so this is not the problem, more than 70% of RAM is free


[15-Mar-19 08:11 AM] Mazzz#1871
Is a fast ram required? Would swap ram (from SSD) be sufficient?


[15-Mar-19 08:42 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@Mazzz not sure


[15-Mar-19 09:43 AM] Mazzz#1871
Hmm, now I'm wondering would you get more rewards if you ran multiple instances of the miner with multiple ips?


[15-Mar-19 09:44 AM] Vilenarios#8742
On different machines yes


[15-Mar-19 09:44 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I wouldn’t run multiple instances of the miner on the same machine.


[15-Mar-19 10:26 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@Mazzz No, this is unlikely, because the CPU will not be faster to mine from two or three or more running miners


[15-Mar-19 01:29 PM] Marcin#0065
3 cores of an i5-6600k @4,2ghz outperform 12 cores of amd @ 4ghz. just to mention. dont know why. somehow intel seems to work way better for mining


[15-Mar-19 01:30 PM] Marcin#0065
outperform in case of mining rewards


[15-Mar-19 05:44 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Hey @slayer_hellraiser how are you autostarting arweave miner on boot?


[15-Mar-19 09:37 PM] Vilenarios#8742
@arweave-martin so is it possible to basically have a couple dozen miners on a very fast LAN and outmine blocks before other servers really start?

[15-Mar-19 09:58 PM] chriscord#4741
Good question


[15-Mar-19 10:01 PM] ATLAS#7218
Even if you mine, you would have to distribute to as many nodes as possible, and as fast as possible to minimize your block being rejected


[15-Mar-19 10:02 PM] ATLAS#7218
You get lucky. Especially if you have big hashrate. Nothing special in that 3 blocks


[15-Mar-19 10:03 PM] ATLAS#7218
To only mine inside your local network and then make the outer network accept, you would basically need to do the 51% attack.


[16-Mar-19 01:41 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@Vilenarios /etc/rc.local


[16-Mar-19 06:18 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I’m not saying do a 51% attack


[16-Mar-19 06:18 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I’m just suggesting that wildfire score will prioritize your own nodes automatically after a while


[16-Mar-19 06:18 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Since they are all local to you and will have the best connection


[16-Mar-19 08:48 AM] Dentechr#5213
Possible to run arweave on an different harddisk ? When i do ./arweave-server i get permission denied


[16-Mar-19 09:10 AM] ivhturp#3325
My miners did get this streak of 2-3 blocks decent number of times(this was 2 months back) but every-time it was from a single miner. Its probably just luck and better hash rates as @ATLAS  mentioned


[16-Mar-19 09:13 AM] Vilenarios#8742
That’s good to know ivhturp


[16-Mar-19 09:56 AM] ATLAS#7218
Yeah. I think its possible to have local environment where everyone's peer is one each other. But that might cause closed network which no outer world will accept. Maybe devs will give more input


[16-Mar-19 09:57 AM] Vilenarios#8742
You will slowly favor your own nodes with wildfire right?


[16-Mar-19 09:05 PM] ivhturp#3325
In closed network, I doubt wildfire would play a part especially if you have 10 or 20 odd nodes. I remember some dev saying, the mined block is shared with top 16(?) peers. 
This setup should definitely have a better chance to get the streak.


[17-Mar-19 06:00 AM] Mazzz#1871
anyone tried mining on an AMD EPYC?


[17-Mar-19 06:18 AM] Marcin#0065
Amd is way worse


[17-Mar-19 06:18 AM] Marcin#0065
Intel is more efficient


[17-Mar-19 06:19 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Well, I want to try AMD Threadripper


[17-Mar-19 06:20 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Just to compare with my favorite processor.


[17-Mar-19 06:23 AM] Mazzz#1871
@Marcin  Hmm that's strange. That's the opposite when it comes to GPU mining


[17-Mar-19 06:24 AM] Mazzz#1871
Is there a reason for it? Or is it just because they generally have a lower clockspeed?


[17-Mar-19 06:38 AM] Vilenarios#8742
@slayer_hellraiser I think @Marcin ran a threadripper and the performance wasn’t so hot


[17-Mar-19 06:59 AM] Marcin#0065
I used a 12 core threadripper. It used around 300 watts overclocked.

I switched to my i5 6600k with 4 cores. It used 100 watts.

The intel mines more rewards, or at least even with the threadripper.


[17-Mar-19 07:00 AM] Marcin#0065
Also, the latency i way better with the intel.


[17-Mar-19 07:01 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Yeah I regret getting the ryzen. Although it’s an arweave miner/Plex server


[17-Mar-19 07:07 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Gettin the most out of it. It’s an awesome build just not for mining AR.


[17-Mar-19 06:21 PM] Marcin#0065
Where does the difference between Transaction Fee and Tx reward pool goes? A single transaction does cost more than the transaction reward for the mined block (with only that single transaction) is. So how is the difference handled? @arweave-lev


[18-Mar-19 03:30 AM] ivhturp#3325
I'm curious about https://viewblock.io/arweave/address/Rch36khXGPNhMt4xTcfjszeigkucXE7zbA4aivhjpaI  . There is only one inward transaction of 128011.59 AR and no outward txns. And current balance is just 88189.589 AR. Is it bug with Viewblock or am I missing something


[18-Mar-19 03:38 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@Marcin transaction fees go into the reward pool. Miners get rewards from the pool, proportionally to the size of the recall block. So, the difference stays in the pool.

@ivhturp there are outgoing txs - http://arweave.net/wallet/Rch36khXGPNhMt4xTcfjszeigkucXE7zbA4aivhjpaI/txs


[18-Mar-19 04:27 AM] Marcin#0065
@arweave-lev thank you :)


[18-Mar-19 04:53 AM] ivhturp#3325
@arweave-lev Thanks. Looks like viewblock doesn't have the txn


[18-Mar-19 04:54 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@Vilenarios Sure, you can choose not to publish the block you just mined. But why would you? You can also modify the software instead of making the nodes non-accessable from the Internet.

@vitosfizik You should copy more directories from  the other miner. The mining guide is recently updated with instructions for how do this. See "Bootstrap the second miner faster" on https://docs.arweave.org/info/mining/mining-guide

@arweave-martin I have noticed  `However if you are using a dynamic IP, make sure you’re operating in ‘polling mode’` in the docs page. How does dynamic IP help in polling mode?


[19-Mar-19 10:06 AM] ivhturp#3325
Btw docs are simple, crispy and informative. Nice work 💯


[19-Mar-19 10:09 AM] ATLAS#7218
polling mode helps dynamic ip.


[19-Mar-19 10:11 AM] ivhturp#3325
Wildfire score doesn't play a role in polling mode I suppose?


[19-Mar-19 10:11 AM] ATLAS#7218
To simply put, because your address keeps changing its hard to keep track of you. So polling mode helps with that.


[19-Mar-19 10:12 AM] ATLAS#7218
polling mode does not have anything to do with wildfire score but it affects your performance in some way. And THAT can affect your wildfire score


[19-Mar-19 10:13 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@ivhturp That doens't make sense to me. Just because dynamic IP is suboptimal doens't mean you should make if worse by running in polling mode. I'll look into it.


[19-Mar-19 10:14 AM] ATLAS#7218
Is it possible to run without polling mode when you have dynamic ip?


[19-Mar-19 10:14 AM] ivhturp#3325
I use VPS which gives me dynamic IPs on boot. Do I need to consider polling mode in this scenario as well?

I barely reboot - so they are static in a sense


[19-Mar-19 10:15 AM] ATLAS#7218
If thats the case, you dont need to run in polling mode.


[19-Mar-19 10:16 AM] ATLAS#7218
Polling mode will affect your performance a lot. But on reboot, your wildfire score will be reset most probably.


[19-Mar-19 10:17 AM] ivhturp#3325
Yeah, I have noticed the rewards going down considerably for some time when ever IP is changed -- probably because of wildfire


[19-Mar-19 10:18 AM] arweave-martin#1169
Every time your IP address changes, your Wildfire score is reset. If it happens every hour, then that will probably be an issue and then polling mode might be better. But most likely your IP address won't change very often.


[19-Mar-19 10:18 AM] ivhturp#3325
Yeah, in the scenario where IP doesn't change frequently, I guess it's not requried


[19-Mar-19 10:19 AM] ivhturp#3325
How exactly does the wildfire fluctuate if node is unreachable, say for couple of hours? And in what time does wildfire score go to normal. I am thinking to explore static IPs if this has a major impact


[19-Mar-19 10:20 AM] ATLAS#7218
Depends on your current wildfire most probably. If your current wildfire is very good, nodes will try to reach you often which in turn will lower your wildfire more rapidly in other nodes.


[19-Mar-19 10:20 AM] ATLAS#7218
So its more like exponential decay


[19-Mar-19 10:21 AM] ATLAS#7218
And its hard to say exactly because each node has different wildfire score of your node.


[19-Mar-19 10:21 AM] ivhturp#3325
Makes sense @ATLAS  regarding exponential decay


[19-Mar-19 10:22 AM] ivhturp#3325
But devs must have factored this


[19-Mar-19 10:22 AM] ATLAS#7218
Yeah. Just pouring what I have.


[19-Mar-19 10:23 AM] ivhturp#3325
Yes, it is insightful  


[20-Mar-19 12:39 PM] Marcin#0065
Does an estimation exist how much energy (electricity) 1AR costs you guys?
My case:
100wh on the machine for 32AR a day (roughly).
2.4kwh makes around 60 cents (EUR). So 1 AR needs around 2 cents (EUR) in energy cost at the moment.
USA with cheaper electricity even reduces that calculation.

These errors coming often. What could be the reason?


[21-Mar-19 04:13 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@prk At least one JSON file (could be a block, a transaction etc)  is not complete. One reason for this could be you run out of disk space which resulted in new files are empty. The node still works fine even when this happens.


[21-Mar-19 06:49 AM] prk#3209
@arweave-martin yes, I think that's the issue

[22-Mar-19 05:36 AM] arweave-martin#1169
Hi @gcc_awe! Please note this is not an error message, just information in the log. To be able to participate in mining, you need to have the so called recall block. If you have 10% of all blocks, then it's 10% chance you will be able to mine the next block. If you browse to the `/info` endpoint on your miner, then you will see the "blocks" metrics witch tells you how many blocks your miner has stored on disk currently. It's also downloading random blocks in the background all the time.


[22-Mar-19 05:39 AM] arweave-martin#1169
The reason Arweave is using this recall block is to incentivise miners to store blocks. You can read more about it in the lightpaper. This log message is also explained in our mining guide https://docs.arweave.org/info/mining/mining-guide

[24-Mar-19 09:42 PM] ivhturp#3325
It looks like most of the blocks are mined by a single miner - using different addresses. Do they belong to arweave team by any chance? @arweave-stan @joannaz 
I am not sure if I'm asking too much but would it be possible to publish the mining addresses used by the team.


[24-Mar-19 09:45 PM] ivhturp#3325
@Vilenarios Same here bro. My miners are mining ~30% of blocks they used to mine a month ago.

[25-Mar-19 01:35 AM] rehash#3438
what address?


[25-Mar-19 01:36 AM] ivhturp#3325
Some of them- G5m6plnC8pKBQFDZOjZvCscbGL216zE_bCexAzM-7UI,  ZWdCrVavDhnmqEzgixbAKHULLlgrlVODd8U4oJlAKGE . You can follow the transactions and find many addresses. Either they have been doing OTC txns or they are a single miner accumulating a good amount !


[25-Mar-19 01:43 AM] rehash#3438
those look like unofficial OTC, they first send a test then split into smaller amounts to reduce risks

@ivhturp How do you distinguish miners from addresses? How do you know that different addresses belong to the same miner?


[25-Mar-19 07:17 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Yeah I followed some miner addresses to a 600k AR wallet.


[25-Mar-19 09:34 AM] prk#3209
Is it possible to check out how many blocks I mined from my miner till now?


[25-Mar-19 11:22 AM] ivhturp#3325
@lvb I was following trail of major transactions where most of them led to a handful of addresses. Only possible explanation I could see was 
1. They all have a common OTC partner
2. All addresses belong to a single miner


[25-Mar-19 11:23 AM] ivhturp#3325
@prk You can check the log files in `logs` folder


[25-Mar-19 11:59 AM] Vilenarios#8742
@prk or u can take the wallet balance on your miner and divide by 32. Should be a good estimate.


[25-Mar-19 09:10 PM] awkweird#6550
My miner is gradually out performed by other miners. Hasn’t gotten a block for like 3 days.

[25-Mar-19 09:43 PM] ATLAS#7218
Most probably difficulty increased


[25-Mar-19 09:44 PM] ATLAS#7218

[25-Mar-19 11:08 PM] prk#3209
@ivhturp I checked logs folder and can see two files in it. Like session_timestamp .log


[25-Mar-19 11:08 PM] prk#3209
Does it mean I mined two blocks?


[25-Mar-19 11:10 PM] prk#3209
@Vilenarios i mines on two machines to a same address. Just want to check blocks from each one seperately. So checking on explorer doesn't work

@prk A new log file is created every time you start the `arweave-server`. 
You can count for lines such as `Your block <BLOCK ID> was accepted by the network!` in log files to know the number of blocks produced.


[27-Mar-19 09:50 AM] tiamat#9131
⚠  I see at least 23 nodes which are in NOT_JOINED state or simply out of sync, some on 140k-150k zone. Maybe Arweave should send a notification to those subscribed in mining newsletter to check their node against viewblock.io/arweave height? 23 servers wasting resources....

How many GB space i need for regular mining ?


[28-Mar-19 11:21 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@gcc_awe Currently you need around 120GB to store all blocks.


[28-Mar-19 12:20 PM] Marcin#0065
How do 120gb come together? Stored data is around 1% of it. Does it keep scale that way? Do 1tb of stored data make 100tb of foldersize? ;)

These are the kind of questions which will come up


[28-Mar-19 12:30 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-martin hmm. Right now i see 59GB on my oldest mining server (3 months online):

59G    /root/source/arweave
This is only 50% from all blockchain?

@Vilenarios So how much does your miner use?


[29-Mar-19 04:40 AM] arweave-martin#1169
I checked a few of our full nodes. They use around 120GB. They have been running for a long time, so it's likely the cleanup script would free up a lot of space.

[31-Mar-19 07:06 AM] arthur#6010
i transferred `blocks`, `txs` and `wallet_lists` but later made a new wallets_list directory and started to download again, now it has downloaded around 100k files in wallets_list folder

Changing peer should fix it. If its not working then its probably because your cpu is taking too much load

[03-Apr-19 04:25 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@arthur it's important to stop both nodes when copying over files from one server to the other. I suspect this is the cause of the issue you are facing (we used to have similar situations before).


[03-Apr-19 04:25 AM] Deleted User#0000

copying files was my next step to debug this by getting a bigger server


[03-Apr-19 04:28 AM] arweave-lev#3466
Ok, no problem, let's see how it goes now. I'll change `make clean` so that it does not clean up logs.


[03-Apr-19 05:27 AM] arweave-lev#3466
These nodes are online but have fallen behind while running the latest release (21) - `74.105.39.88:1986`, `18.184.163.162:1984`, `45.32.251.207:1984`, `45.32.251.207:1984`. If you are the owner of any of them, please write me a message - we would investigate the cause.

Also, there are similar nodes on release 19 - `178.62.126.142:1984`, `159.65.91.188:1984`, `206.189.5.178:1984`, `52.214.17.211:1984`. If you are the owner of one of those, it would be helpful if you send some logs too, but also note it is a relatively old release so we strongly recommended to update.

[04-Apr-19 05:23 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@here Today we are happy to announce the release 1.6.3 of the Arweave Node!

In it:

1. The `block/hash/[hash]` and `block/height/[height]` HTTP endpoints do not return a hash list by default anymore. Viewing blocks in a browser/other HTTP client is now much faster!
2. Reliability improvements of the time measurement for difficulty adjustments.
3. Various reliability improvements for the mining worker processes.
4. New mining benchmark tool, using real candidate block production to measure mining performance much more accurately. You can run it with `./arweave-server benchmark`.Note: As the new benchmarking tool tests real block production speed, not just pure hashing power, it may appear that the effective hashing rate has decreased. This is false. As it happens, the changes mentioned in point 3 lead to improved mining performance.

Upgrade instructions:

1. Shut down arweave-server. To make sure the shutdown was successful, run `ps aux | grep beam`. The output should only have a single line with `grep beam` at the end.
2. git fetch --all --tags && git checkout master && git reset --hard N.1.6.3.1
3. Start arweave-server again with the same arguments as before.

For more details on how to run the node, please see our mining guide -                                                 
https://docs.arweave.org/info/mining/mining-guide.

Pay attention to the recommended list of peers. It has not been updated since the last release. These peers are all operated by the Arweave organization, so use them if you trust them - alternatively join on the IP address of another trusted node.

[04-Apr-19 07:17 AM] Vilenarios#8742
My cloud miner has stayed consistent, but my on-prem intel and amd miners both have dropped like 30% from the starting hashrate, and it looks like its still getting lower


[04-Apr-19 07:17 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I wonder if some of the auto overclocking is maybe screwing with it


[04-Apr-19 07:20 AM] Marcin#0065
Probably yes. Check if ur ghz stays stable while the hash goes down


[04-Apr-19 07:30 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@Vilenarios the "Since start" value should stabilize over time. When the benchmark receives a valid hash, it counts it as if the miner has tried out half of all possible hashes for the given difficulty.

well that worked

i had it pointing to another peer of mine, which wasnt up yet


[04-Apr-19 08:07 AM] arweave-lev#3466
Ok, sorry for the inconvenience. An update is on the way.


[04-Apr-19 08:07 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Cool!


[04-Apr-19 08:08 AM] Vilenarios#8742
it joined very quickly


[04-Apr-19 08:18 AM] Vilenarios#8742
So during these updates, everyone restarts their miners, and effectively resets wildfire scores everywhere.


[04-Apr-19 09:00 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Fair criticism -- we will put WF score persistence on the list.


[04-Apr-19 09:00 AM] arweave-sam#9630
For now though the scores will return pretty quickly


[04-Apr-19 09:16 AM] prk#3209

Not grep beam

Is it ok?


[04-Apr-19 09:17 AM] arweave-lev#3466
Yes


[04-Apr-19 09:17 AM] prk#3209
Ok


[04-Apr-19 09:28 AM] arweave-lev#3466
If any of you has already updated to N.1.6.3.0, consider updating to N.1.6.3.1. It contains a fix for the bug when startup would fail if one of the trusted peers is unavailable (thanks @Vilenarios for reporting the issue!). I've also updated the release announcement above to mention N.16.3.1. Under "/info" you should see `"release:" 23`.


[04-Apr-19 09:37 AM] prk#3209

It should not. It says more than 80% of the memory is full.


[04-Apr-19 12:21 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Thanks @arweave-lev will update to that version later.


[04-Apr-19 01:16 PM] rehash#3438
new benchmark is per core or total ?


[04-Apr-19 01:19 PM] rehash#3438
@arweave-lev


[04-Apr-19 01:21 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@rehash As i know - per server (all cores)


[04-Apr-19 01:24 PM] arweave-lev#3466
@rehash it's total. Note that you can use the max_miners option as usual to change the number of cores to use. By default it's available cores - 1.


[04-Apr-19 01:25 PM] tiamat#9131
my upgraded node mines much better than the rest which I did not upgrade yet, is it only the hashing improved or communication as well?


[04-Apr-19 01:31 PM] arweave-lev#3466
Mostly hashing. The communication was improved in the previous release.


[05-Apr-19 07:09 AM] Mazzz#1871
So is the update making hashing more efficient the only reason for the increase in difficulty?


[05-Apr-19 07:18 AM] rehash#3438
yeah, plus those voucher canadian servers


[05-Apr-19 07:22 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
You guys got to the Canadians? )))) They just mined as they can in their cold climate, in the summer I think they will be less, the snow will melt))


[05-Apr-19 09:30 AM] Mazzz#1871
has anyone successfully set up a cross-server filesystem?


[05-Apr-19 09:31 AM] Mazzz#1871
I'm trying to get NFS and sshfs to work with arweave, but they seem too slow


[05-Apr-19 09:58 AM] ivhturp#3325
@Mazzz Slow file access speed would decrease the mining efficiency as it requires the  access of recall blocks, but I don't think it would be signficant given that block file size is very small at the moment.


[05-Apr-19 01:17 PM] JW#2445
It is a pity to notice that the last 10 blocks are mined by 4 people....

Looks like 39 :pickspark: is too hard for the current hash power. Its been 30 mins without a block


[06-Apr-19 12:50 AM] vitosfizik#9289
Tell me, several miners work on the same wallet, can I somehow find out which IP received the award?


[06-Apr-19 01:02 AM] ivhturp#3325
Only option is to go through logs in each miner


[06-Apr-19 01:19 AM] vitosfizik#9289
Its a pitty, I thought it was somehow possible to find out in another way, for example, through viewblock.io or another site.


[06-Apr-19 01:19 AM] prk#3209
Not possible as of now


[06-Apr-19 01:21 AM] vitosfizik#9289
And the data logs can be obtained by an external request? Or only directly on the server to see?


[06-Apr-19 02:07 AM] tiamat#9131
I hope not, that would be big a security issue


[06-Apr-19 02:08 AM] vitosfizik#9289
Is logical


[06-Apr-19 03:05 AM] ivhturp#3325
Yes, it wil be a privacy concern if IP can be found out from the blocks.


[06-Apr-19 03:06 AM] ivhturp#3325
You can sync all the logs on a central server to keep things simple or can customise the code to record statistics


[06-Apr-19 04:54 AM] arweave-sam#9630
> And the data logs can be obtained by an external request? Or only directly on the server to see?
Only on the local server.


[06-Apr-19 04:55 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Block origin is actually extremely difficult to determine, as blocks are gossiped between nodes in the same way that the original miner initially sends the block to its peers.


[06-Apr-19 04:55 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You can never be truly sure whether the person that sent you the block is a relayer, or the miner themselves


[06-Apr-19 04:58 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@tiamat Yes, that is an all time high  


[06-Apr-19 04:58 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Looking forward to diff = 40  


[06-Apr-19 04:59 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I remember when we were launching the first test net back in Oct 2017, waiting for the Genesis block to mine at difficulty 22 was a nightmare  


[06-Apr-19 05:01 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@Deleted User Worth noting that although competition for blocks is definitely increasing, we did also release an update this week that increased mining performance so the miner you start will also be more efficient

[06-Apr-19 05:30 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I can confirm that I have had increased block finding after recent patch.


[06-Apr-19 05:30 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Let’s hope the big miners don’t upgrade.  


[06-Apr-19 06:05 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@Vilenarios They have already been updated. The first day after the update, my miner earned more than before. Now daily production has returned to its previous value.


[06-Apr-19 06:10 AM] tiamat#9131
first day was more, but still higher than before


[06-Apr-19 06:59 AM] prk#3209
How much blocks are you guys getting per day now?
Would be good to know


[06-Apr-19 07:01 AM] prk#3209
For like 4/8/ so core machines


[06-Apr-19 08:06 AM] tiamat#9131
around 4 blocks for 4x2 Skylake  cores


[06-Apr-19 08:09 AM] tiamat#9131
but only 6 out of 8 mining


[06-Apr-19 08:10 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
8 Hyper-Treading cores or physical?


[06-Apr-19 08:11 AM] tiamat#9131
4 cores 8 hyper


[06-Apr-19 08:25 AM] rehash#3438
with the risk of being called retard again, rewards are way too generous, we need 10x more miners to equilibrate or a hard fork to reduce rewards


[06-Apr-19 08:29 AM] rehash#3438
@Mazzz making adjustments/tuning has nothing to do with trust, really


[06-Apr-19 10:40 AM] vitosfizik#9289
After updating for more than a day, I don’t have one block, although before that it was always an average of 4 per day (several miners). What could be the reason?


[06-Apr-19 02:02 PM] tiamat#9131
@arweave-sam  diff 39 reached a couple of times so I guess 40 is not far

I guess this is a confirmation for old miners doing a good thing  


[09-Apr-19 08:59 AM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
How much AR do you make with a single node per week - min vs max.


[09-Apr-19 09:02 AM] prk#3209
0 now lol


[09-Apr-19 09:04 AM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
That’s not very helpful.. but ok


[09-Apr-19 09:04 AM] Marcin#0065
Yes, rewards have decreased massively for me too


[09-Apr-19 09:04 AM] Marcin#0065
Like it's 30% of what I had few weeks ago


[09-Apr-19 09:05 AM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
Difficulty went up, from what I heard.


[09-Apr-19 09:05 AM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
But how much was your stable reward a few weeks back?


[09-Apr-19 09:13 AM] prk#3209
Depends on your machine specs


[09-Apr-19 09:13 AM] rehash#3438
which a decent machine you could make 1000 AR/ month at this diff


[09-Apr-19 09:14 AM] prk#3209
@rehash machine with how much cores?


[09-Apr-19 09:15 AM] rehash#3438
4 cores 8 threads, running 6 miners


[09-Apr-19 09:15 AM] prk#3209
That is around 1 blocks per day


[09-Apr-19 09:16 AM] prk#3209
Impossible at present difficulty I would say


[09-Apr-19 09:16 AM] rehash#3438
that means 1 block per day


[09-Apr-19 09:16 AM] prk#3209
Oh my bad


[09-Apr-19 09:17 AM] prk#3209
I was getting 1 block/day on my 4 vCPU cloud machine till two weeks ago


[09-Apr-19 09:18 AM] prk#3209
Now it's like 1 block in every 3 days


[09-Apr-19 09:18 AM] tiamat#9131
depends what vCPU


[09-Apr-19 09:18 AM] tiamat#9131
are they dedicated? shared? what generation, Mhz, etc


[09-Apr-19 09:20 AM] prk#3209
I was saying that the rewards decreased by around 70% in less than 2 weeks


[09-Apr-19 09:20 AM] prk#3209
Whereas the no. Of nodes increased by like only 30% in that time


[09-Apr-19 09:21 AM] prk#3209
Doesn't seems proportional


[09-Apr-19 09:22 AM] rehash#3438
of course, they are not very relevant, a node can be 1 cpu or 32+ cpus


[09-Apr-19 09:22 AM] prk#3209
Correct


[09-Apr-19 09:23 AM] rehash#3438
for instance today there were like 50+ new nodes, diff went up from 38-39 to 39-40


[09-Apr-19 09:23 AM] prk#3209
But Still it is high


[09-Apr-19 09:24 AM] prk#3209
@rehash are you running a physical miner?


[09-Apr-19 09:24 AM] rehash#3438
yes


[09-Apr-19 09:45 AM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
Uhm ok. Thanks


[09-Apr-19 10:21 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Congrats on difficulty 40, all  


[09-Apr-19 10:21 AM] arweave-sam#9630
That is a pretty major milestone for the strength of the network.

[09-Apr-19 11:24 AM] Marcin#0065
where does viewblock checks the difficulty?


[09-Apr-19 01:34 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@Marcin https://viewblock.io/arweave/blocks


[09-Apr-19 01:34 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We just hit 41 for the first time.


[09-Apr-19 01:36 PM] Vilenarios#8742
@arweave-sam  so how many TX do you think the network could handle?


[09-Apr-19 01:52 PM] Marcin#0065
I mean, where can I check the current difficulty? All I see is the number of viewblock webpage, but it's up to them what to show. Where do they get those information?


[09-Apr-19 02:02 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
lol their github link. Nice meme https://github.com/ViewBlock


[09-Apr-19 02:02 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
I would not mind checking the code to figure that out


[09-Apr-19 02:07 PM] tiamat#9131
@Marcin check in ./blocks each block has diff


[09-Apr-19 02:17 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
he's asking where they gather that info


[09-Apr-19 02:17 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
i'd guess the cli wallet has that info tho


[09-Apr-19 02:19 PM] tiamat#9131
each node has that info in ./blocks


[09-Apr-19 02:20 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
How long does it take to be in a block?


[09-Apr-19 02:20 PM] tiamat#9131
120 sec


[09-Apr-19 02:21 PM] tiamat#9131
but with PoW it can be more or less


[09-Apr-19 02:21 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
weird my transaction is pending for 8minutes


[09-Apr-19 02:22 PM] tiamat#9131
still pending? last block was seconds ago


[09-Apr-19 02:23 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
took 5 blocks i guess


[09-Apr-19 02:26 PM] tiamat#9131
how did you check confirmation? wallet or viewblock?


[09-Apr-19 02:27 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
wallet


[09-Apr-19 02:30 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
Where can i read the numbers stuff? Block size, block time, supply, block reward.


[09-Apr-19 02:30 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
Can't find anything


[09-Apr-19 02:31 PM] tiamat#9131
whitepaper/lightpaper


[09-Apr-19 02:31 PM] tiamat#9131
blocks are tiny because they don't include transactions


[09-Apr-19 02:32 PM] tiamat#9131
Arweave has some innovations and is a bit different


[09-Apr-19 02:32 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
the whitepaper has no numbers


[09-Apr-19 02:32 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
Just general terms


[09-Apr-19 02:32 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
Which makes senee


[09-Apr-19 02:32 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
Cause numbers should be somewhat flexible


[09-Apr-19 02:33 PM] tiamat#9131
to summerize: block size=~1k  block time= ~120sec     supply 55 mil , block reward 32 AR slowly decreasing


[09-Apr-19 02:34 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
55M AR. Ok


[09-Apr-19 02:34 PM] tiamat#9131
uploaded files and transactions are not stored in blocks they are separated which means you could do some kind of "sharding" at later stages when things occupy a lot of space


[09-Apr-19 02:44 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
Makes sense. But i can't find any info on that.  


[09-Apr-19 02:45 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
I read it lightly on the whitepaper already tho


[09-Apr-19 02:46 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
Like if i want to store tons of tiny files i'd like to know how that would work for me and how much it would cost


[09-Apr-19 02:50 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
I went after that otc thing but their minimum buy amount is 20k. That's not very welcoming


[09-Apr-19 02:50 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
So not even a clue about circulating supply i guess


[09-Apr-19 02:52 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
Also idk how they can even sell 250k dollars of AR.  You guys here were discussing that 1AR = 20 cents roughly. 250k would be 2.5% of the whole supply...


[09-Apr-19 02:52 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
It's weird


[09-Apr-19 02:54 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
However, some guys here claiming they making 1000AR per week with one machine. That seems absurdly high for a price of 20 cents per AR...


[09-Apr-19 02:55 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
Price is a real incognito


[09-Apr-19 05:22 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻 Regarding the storage cost. You can ask the network for the current price to store a certain amount of data. So for 1MB (1048576 bytes) the current cost is found here: http://arweave.net/price/1048576


[09-Apr-19 05:23 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
how many decimals is AR?


[09-Apr-19 05:24 PM] arweave-stan#3973
The price is in Windston, so you should divide it with 1000000000000 to get the number of AR.


[09-Apr-19 05:24 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
oh ok


[09-Apr-19 05:24 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
so 0.12 AR


[09-Apr-19 05:25 PM] arweave-stan#3973
Also, another thing good to know is that the price per MB goes up with the size. So storing one 1000MB file is much higher than splitting it up into 1000 chunks of 1MB.


[09-Apr-19 05:25 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
is there a breakpoint or is it just an exponential function


[09-Apr-19 05:27 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
cause my plan was to store rather tiny documents. Probably 1-5 kb


[09-Apr-19 05:27 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
but lots of them


[09-Apr-19 05:27 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
Sending multiple in the same tx would help as well


[09-Apr-19 08:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
I haven't run the numbers, and my understanding is that it is cheaper to store data as smaller chunks


[09-Apr-19 09:08 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
hey guys my log is kinda frozen on ` stored_recall_block_for_foreign_verification` for 5 hours

@pantsme 8GB RAM is recommended for miner to run. Better CPU increases prospect of mined blocks
@luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻 You should see logs of new blocks received from network and their verification every couple of minutes. Either your miner is frozen or you are checking wrong logs. Restart should fix the problem in case miner is frozen


[10-Apr-19 02:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
@pantsme note your disk full alarm...


[10-Apr-19 02:22 AM] lvb#9709
The "disk full" alarms in that particular log extract have to do with "snap" devices, which are not relevant to data storage, but are used for software package deployment.


[10-Apr-19 02:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
@luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻 check out zopfil: "Zopfli Compression Algorithm is a compression library programmed in C to perform very good, but slow, deflate or zlib compression." It is gzip compatible, so you trade slower compression time for less space, and regular de- compression times.

Any help?

@arweave-stan


[15-Apr-19 04:21 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@Marcin the cleanup script has an issue. We have fixed it recently and it will be part of the next release. For now, you could cleanup some space by doing `rm blocks/enc/*` and `rm blocks/invalid/*`


[15-Apr-19 04:26 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@tiamat Yep  


[15-Apr-19 04:26 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Although it seemed a bit overly optimistic. One of the blocks at diff 42 took over an hour to mine.


[15-Apr-19 07:19 AM] Marcin#0065
@arweave-lev it's not about space. It's just for myself, to know I got rid of all wrong blocks. I rather wait for the release to run it , thx

[15-Apr-19 10:51 AM] arweave-martin#1169
Hi @Goldberg | StakeSquid! 1984 is the default port for the Arweave miner. You can access it by browsing to http://[ip-address]:1984/


[15-Apr-19 10:52 AM] arweave-martin#1169
And the `beam.smp` process is the Erlang VM. So, it's very expected that beam.smp is listening on port 1984.

i wonder what makes it alert. maybe its just the port.

Thanks @arweave-stan. I've been through the mining guide. Unless I missed something (read it on my phone), It only says the algorithm favors storage space and then sends me to this discord to get more details. I'm looking for discussions/guidance for an optimal setup, specifc specs, etc.


[16-Apr-19 01:42 AM] rehash#3438
@Zebra you need at least 100 GB storage, excellent network link and as much CPU power as possible, like 32 vCPUs


[16-Apr-19 03:22 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@Goldberg | StakeSquid That `Fuckit Rootkit` warning seems to be because that rootkit also uses port 1984.

@arweave-sam  I am running release 23 {"network":"arweave.N.1","version":5,"release":23,"height":180047,"current":"TV_jr71FrKLd15qNYyt3KluAwW3P0jDhk3srHZO_IBonlT1qwOWo_Dy_u8Ljt7jf","blocks":180996,"peers":215,"queue_length":0,"node_state_latency":12}


[16-Apr-19 11:56 AM] JW#2445
strange thing is that my current height is running a few blocks ahead of what is listed in the chronobot


[16-Apr-19 11:57 AM] JW#2445
I have more then enough disk space


[16-Apr-19 12:10 PM] arweave-lev#3466
@JW chronobot is lagging behind a little bit (I suspect deliberately so, to not display young forks). You can also use Viewblock - https://viewblock.io/arweave or just one of our nodes specified in the mining gude (GET /info) or any other node you trust.


[16-Apr-19 12:29 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Just going to `https://arweave.net` also gets you the latest height :).


[16-Apr-19 01:12 PM] JW#2445
@arweave-lev @arweave-sam  Thnx guys, but the real issue is why I haven't mined a block in over a week


[16-Apr-19 01:15 PM] prk#3209
How much vCPU?


[17-Apr-19 01:44 AM] Marcin#0065
Yeah, it's been a week without a block too. Since those 40+ difficulties. At least the machine is in sync


[17-Apr-19 07:45 AM] aurora#3501
how much mh/s is your machine doing ?


[17-Apr-19 01:03 PM] helloworld#5874
7 mh/s per core, 20 cores for miner, no block for a week too.


[17-Apr-19 01:48 PM] rehash#3438
yeah, diff went up madly, you need either _very strong machine_ or _very many machines_


[17-Apr-19 11:48 PM] Dentechr#5213
I also noticed very very few blocks lately


[18-Apr-19 05:30 AM] Mazzz#1871
I heard somewhere that a one point increase in difficulty the likely hood of mining a block halves, is that true?


[18-Apr-19 05:35 AM] arweave-lev#3466
Yes

Baller dude!!


[19-Apr-19 12:30 AM] JW#2445
It was never about the processor capacity but all about storage. The lastest block are mined by just 4 or 5 people/wallets...


[19-Apr-19 05:13 AM] Vilenarios#8742
What u mean @JW ?


[19-Apr-19 05:14 AM] Vilenarios#8742
U think biggest miners have the most storage? I don’t think total storage availability  plays any part in hashing.


[19-Apr-19 05:14 AM] Vilenarios#8742
If u have 5 exabytes of free storage u won’t find a block any faster than a dude with 100GB


[19-Apr-19 07:51 AM] Vilenarios#8742
wDIHG87eYpTnHqcIii8ADDbrqe7vpjyii2EP4PIvaCc mined 8 blocks in last 30 mins.  Managed to mine 4 blocks in 2 minutes...


[19-Apr-19 07:51 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Wonder what they running with.  4 mined blocks back to back in 2 mins


[19-Apr-19 08:53 AM] JW#2445
@Vilenarios I understand that storage doesnt help mining. But inline with your observation what are the requirements to have at least a block a day?


[19-Apr-19 08:55 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Well my 4cpu cloud machine stopped getting a block a day.


[19-Apr-19 08:56 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I think at least 8cpu needed now


[19-Apr-19 08:57 AM] Vilenarios#8742
My i7-7800x averages 45AR per day


[19-Apr-19 08:57 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Ryzen 2700x about 14 AR per day


[19-Apr-19 08:58 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I7-7920x about 90AR per day


[19-Apr-19 10:21 AM] JW#2445
That will mean for me that I will shutdown my miner because I will not invest in a 8 core cpu right now


[19-Apr-19 10:21 AM] JW#2445
That is really a pity


[19-Apr-19 10:40 AM] Vilenarios#8742
why shut it down though?


[19-Apr-19 10:40 AM] Vilenarios#8742
you arent earning anything with 4 cpu anymore?


[19-Apr-19 10:40 AM] Vilenarios#8742
should still get a block every couple of days


[19-Apr-19 10:51 AM] Vilenarios#8742
15AR a day at 20 cents an AR is still 3 bucks a day


[19-Apr-19 11:29 AM] prk#3209
4 cpu machine is giving blocks like only in 3 or 4 days now


[19-Apr-19 11:36 AM] ivhturp#3325
@Vilenarios do you calculate electricity bill to estimate net returns?


[19-Apr-19 11:36 AM] Vilenarios#8742
nah


[19-Apr-19 11:36 AM] Vilenarios#8742
each person can do that on their end


[19-Apr-19 11:36 AM] Vilenarios#8742
since electricity is different


[19-Apr-19 11:37 AM] Vilenarios#8742
i havent even checked my cpu rigs for electricity cost... i should probably do that

Hi I just started mining and get consistently  "Friday, 12:49:22: [Stage 1/3] Successfully proved access to recall block. Starting to hash."  I have a static ip and when I go "http://192.168.2.109:1984/info" i get "{"network":"arweave.N.1","version":5,"release":23,"height":181954,"current":"FnlcEtg71OovktZviG48BBlWvJb4w7RMfRYMtYKM9_NRdOHLzuoxQh4494HFAk05","blocks":70891,"peers":205,"queue_length":0,"node_state_latency":627}"  Ideas?


[19-Apr-19 12:03 PM] Vilenarios#8742
ya thats expected


[19-Apr-19 12:03 PM] Vilenarios#8742
means ur mining


[19-Apr-19 12:03 PM] Vilenarios#8742
you have 70k out of the 180k blocks downloaded


[19-Apr-19 12:04 PM] Vilenarios#8742
so you probably see that stage 1 message like 40% of the time


[19-Apr-19 12:22 PM] Rex#1134

Getting this after running the mining command:

unknown argument: 206.189.5.91. Terminating.


[19-Apr-19 01:21 PM] Vilenarios#8742
what command are you running to start the miner?


[19-Apr-19 01:21 PM] Vilenarios#8742
looks like you have a typo in it or something


[19-Apr-19 01:21 PM] Zebra#6733
The one listed in the mining guide. Let me comb over to see if there was a typo somewhere.


[19-Apr-19 01:25 PM] Vilenarios#8742
maybe ur missing a "peer" in front of that IP


[19-Apr-19 01:28 PM] Zebra#6733
I have "peer" in front of it and I don't see any typos. hmmm


[19-Apr-19 01:30 PM] Zebra#6733
Ahh! Never mind  


[19-Apr-19 01:31 PM] Zebra#6733
It was a typo as you suspected. I didn't space between my addy and "peer". There was a line break at that exact point so it didn't stand out to me.

[21-Apr-19 12:43 PM] Rex#1134
With  a i7-4790S CPU @ 3.20GHz × 8, is this an adequate quad core for mining?


[21-Apr-19 02:05 PM] Marcin#0065
Maybe 1-2 blocks a day at the moment.


[21-Apr-19 02:05 PM] Marcin#0065
Whereas 3.2 ghz is low. Try to push it to 4ghz.


[23-Apr-19 09:11 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Hey All - for anyone who is saying that they used to mine blocks more consistently but havent in a while - how often do you restart your miner?


[23-Apr-19 09:11 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I feel like giving my miners a restart every couple of days helps.


[23-Apr-19 09:11 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Even if they are running smoothly


[23-Apr-19 10:07 AM] Zebra#6733
Thanks for the tip


[23-Apr-19 11:02 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hey @Vilenarios -- interesting observation. Please can you DM me any stats you have on this?


[23-Apr-19 11:03 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I would caution against 'reading the tea leaves' too much. Sometimes we find the randomness drives us crazy while testing things  


[23-Apr-19 11:03 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I need to track it closer Sam


[23-Apr-19 11:04 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Without valid metrics it is 100% reading tea leaves so to speak


[23-Apr-19 11:04 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Id just like to collect the ancdotal evidence from others to see if it aligns


[23-Apr-19 11:04 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep, makes sense  


[23-Apr-19 11:04 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I track my earnings sometimes on longer periods of time


[23-Apr-19 11:04 AM] Vilenarios#8742
and i noticed my AR day goes down if i let everything run for a longer time


[23-Apr-19 11:04 AM] Vilenarios#8742
May be other factors too - but ill do better analysis


[23-Apr-19 11:56 AM] prk#3209
When I restarted the server it showed like


[23-Apr-19 11:57 AM] prk#3209
.

Mnesia(nonode@nohost) previous_log_repaired, lost 3997 bytes


[23-Apr-19 12:28 PM] Marcin#0065
I had that feeling too, but I guess it's pure random. I left my little computer left just to stay in sync with blocks, and I have several blocks a day, and sometimes 4 days without a block. So it's hard to say, if reboots does have impacts. 

I once believed, that even streaming videos does influences it positively, coz I found blocks all time when streaming Netflix. Those randomness gives me many speculations. I stopped to think about it :)


[23-Apr-19 12:32 PM] Vilenarios#8742

[23-Apr-19 12:36 PM] Vilenarios#8742
until the past few days, network in/out has been around 10mb in and out


[23-Apr-19 12:36 PM] Vilenarios#8742
super low


[23-Apr-19 12:36 PM] Vilenarios#8742
past couple of days have seen spikes up to 200mb in/out


[23-Apr-19 12:38 PM] Vilenarios#8742
275in, 538 out was the highest.  So i guess its nice to have gigabit network at that point

I am working on node tuning. This will take awhile, and if there is any other miner that is interested i could share preliminary data with as I get it. PM me the output of the following if you are running on *nix: $ uname -srpvio >> miner.txt && sysctl -a >> miner.txt                   if you don't understand what this is don't run it. I am also working on better grafana dashboards with the goal of making this more manageable as the network grows. i'm particularly interested in nodes that are mining unproductively at the current difficulty level.

nope still the same

this behavior happened after I updated to the latest release


[23-Apr-19 06:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
i'm not sure. it is possible that someone else is using your address for mining rewards, it's not an impossibility, it just seems improbable


[23-Apr-19 06:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
also maybe your logs got purged, rotated or deleted for that time period?


[23-Apr-19 06:30 PM] 2072 [ANFRA]#9291
I can see my reward address showing in the logs


[23-Apr-19 06:40 PM] 2072 [ANFRA]#9291
maybe it's race condition in the way logs are created: the block gets sent by the mining thread and is received back by the other threads as a foreign block...


[23-Apr-19 06:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
again a possibility. do make sure you are on the current release, and have the current updates

We updated the peer list in the mining guide a while back when we restructured the different groups of our servers. I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

Hey, anyone mining on AWS? I have received abuse intrustion attempt warning on 2 instances. Did any one face similar issue?


[26-Apr-19 02:19 AM] lvb#9709
@ivhturp Yes, I am mining on AWS too and I have received intrusion warning attemps on 3 instances. I received them a few hours ago, but the attempts were all on April 12, exactly 2 weeks ago. They looked like this, as quoted in the abuse report: 
```"Someone from your network is trying to hack my server 
The list of IPs from which attempts are made to hack my server:
Apr 12 02:13:35 web sshd[10372]: Failed password for root from xx.yy.zz.ww port 55560 ssh2"```
I checked my instances and they had not been compromised at all.
Are these malicious abuse reports? Or some firewall mistaking p2p connections for intrusion attempts?


[26-Apr-19 02:49 AM] ivhturp#3325
Same here, all attempts were on April 12 and I also received alert 3 hrs back.  
Alerts have sshd failure with username as well. Thats what I am confused about


[26-Apr-19 02:50 AM] ivhturp#3325
Logs were consistent across all instances. And I dont see any signs of compromise either

[26-Apr-19 05:22 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hey @ivhturp , @lvb , @rehash , yes we also received one of these yesterday. We have carefully reviewed and found no corresponding outbound traffic from our servers which matches the complaint. I believe that @rehash also performed such a review and did not find any corroborating evidence.

It appears that one of the miners in the network has been sending some of these complaints to the hosting providers of other nodes in order to try and pressure them into turning off their miners and lowering the difficulty. It is our understanding that (depending on jurisdiction) the providers must inform the server operators if they receive such a complaint, but they will not move forward with further action before corroborating that the server has indeed actually been involved in nefarious activities.


[26-Apr-19 05:23 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Lol @ someone on the network complaining about other miners trying to get them shut down via cloud provider.

@arweave-sam 
>>It appears that one of the miners in the network has been sending some of these complaints to the hosting providers of other nodes in order to try and pressure them into turning off their miners and lowering the difficulty.
Are you seriously??? LOL


[26-Apr-19 05:54 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
This is nonsense ... But what about decentralization and the like?


[26-Apr-19 06:39 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Just reminds everyone to harden their miners and use good security


[26-Apr-19 06:41 AM] Vilenarios#8742
what does one bad miner have to do with decentralization though?


[26-Apr-19 06:54 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@Vilenarios Then you think it is good when one bad miner can complain and the provider turns off all the servers of other miners? Personally, I think it's just a nightmare for any miner. The network should, in principle, resist such attacks


[26-Apr-19 06:56 AM] arweave-lev#3466
We haven't heard about the turned off servers yet, they should not be turned off purely on the basis of someone's complaint. Could you clarify, which kind of resistance are you referring to?


[26-Apr-19 06:59 AM] Vilenarios#8742
@slayer_hellraiser how would any network resist this? A miner can choose to run their node however they want


[26-Apr-19 06:59 AM] Vilenarios#8742
As its decentralized.


[26-Apr-19 07:02 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
I meant that when there are a lot of devices on the network, even disabling a couple of hundreds of them should not affect the network. And what do we have now? According to Sam, bad miner has complained to others to earn more. That is, the miner could shut off more than half of the network at least, is it?


[26-Apr-19 07:03 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Umm i dont think anyone has gotten shut down


[26-Apr-19 07:03 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Personally, it seems to me that there are still problems in security on those miners to whom the complaint came.


[26-Apr-19 07:04 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Maybe.


[26-Apr-19 07:04 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Microsoft isnt going to shutdown my cloud server because someone anonymously messages them and says 'theya remining crypto currency"


[26-Apr-19 07:06 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Hmm, but we see a slightly different message that does not concern the mining of cryptocurrency.


[26-Apr-19 07:07 AM] Vilenarios#8742

[26-Apr-19 07:08 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Of course, this is a strange situation ..


[26-Apr-19 07:09 AM] arweave-sam#9630
It is up to each of the miners to choose how they run their nodes. This is the core of decentralisation.

Personally I don't expect that hosts will just turn off nodes after an anonymous complaint. Otherwise you could have many websites removed from the web simply using the same tactic.

But either way it doesn't affect the network as a whole in a serious manner. There are miners running on many different hosts, and in their own homes etc.

@Vilenarios "this definitely looks like just a suspicious IP was trying to SSH in

No, you misunderstood the abuse message. Someone was accusing the miners of trying to break in into their machines, and was sending abuse complaints to Amazon about it. Amazon relayed it to the miners.


[26-Apr-19 09:13 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Ahh okay got it


[26-Apr-19 09:15 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093

[27-Apr-19 12:14 AM] ivhturp#3325
@arweave-lev Will mentioning a peer while starting arweave-server have any positive impact on wildfire score of that peer in shortterm or longterm?


[27-Apr-19 06:57 AM] arweave-lev#3466
It might have a small impact short-term (first hours may be) as these are the first good (if they are good) peers your node learns about. But then it should not make any difference.


[27-Apr-19 06:57 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep, @ivhturp you will prefer those nodes for a short time, but it won't affect how much those nodes 'like' you


[27-Apr-19 08:46 PM] ivhturp#3325
Got it @arweave-lev  @arweave-sam 
Can I add certain nodes as preferred ones for ever irrespective of their wildfire scores. This is to basically give preference to my other nodes. Or any workarounds?


[28-Apr-19 03:37 AM] courtcircuit#8002
morning @arweave-martin I saw difficulty has increased quite a bit but I haven't had anything in the last two weeks at all.... is that normal ?


[28-Apr-19 06:11 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@ivhturp there is no supported way to do this. It kinda breaks the idea of favoring closer peers over the remoter ones. It should not be beneficial not only in general but for your nodes specifically since they would spend time transferring their blocks somewhere far thus spending time and bandwidth that could be otherwise used for maintaining the good score with the close neighbors to learn about their blocks faster.


[28-Apr-19 11:08 AM] ivhturp#3325
@arweave-lev Thought so. Thanks for the detailed explanation though ✌


[28-Apr-19 11:55 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Thanks @arweave-lev !


[28-Apr-19 11:56 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@courtcircuit , yes, difficulty increased as the network has grown recently and we also released an upgrade to the efficiency of the miner.


[28-Apr-19 11:56 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Have you updated your node recently?


[29-Apr-19 12:42 PM] majcoin#8608
where is wildfire score?


[29-Apr-19 04:46 PM] arweave-sam#9630
You can't see your 'global' WF score @majcoin , because there is no global consensus about ranking -- each node simply keeps track of the scores of its peers

sorry the log spam guys... i just thought this was a very interesting one.  Uploaded content shouldnt be getting dumped into log files if you ask me

@Vilenarios You didn't post the beginning of the log message, but it looks like something went wrong when receiving a transaction from another node. Can you please send me a PM with the logfile?


[30-Apr-19 02:52 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@Vilenarios are you running the master branch?


[30-Apr-19 04:50 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Will send you guys the full log. It’s a very long entry... I’ll dig it up for you guys this morning.


[30-Apr-19 04:50 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Pretty sure that node is running latest version.


[30-Apr-19 04:54 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@Vilenarios FYI, it seems like you're running master and not the latest release.


[30-Apr-19 04:55 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Hmmm... what command should I run to get to latest release?


[30-Apr-19 04:58 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@Vilenarios `git fetch --all --tags && git checkout master && git reset --hard N.1.6.3.1`


[30-Apr-19 04:58 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Thx mate. Will run that this morning and get y’all that log.


[30-Apr-19 04:58 AM] arweave-martin#1169
It's copy pasted from the release note in # tech-announcements


[30-Apr-19 04:59 AM] arweave-martin#1169
And you should of course turn off the miner first before you run the git commands


[30-Apr-19 05:01 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Dumb question but is master considered newer than latest release? Or older?


[30-Apr-19 05:02 AM] arweave-martin#1169
Hmmm. I just realised that was weird instructions. Master is where all new code changes end up as soon as they are finished. So `master` is newer then the latest release.


[30-Apr-19 05:03 AM] arweave-martin#1169
Here are updated git commands that makes more sense:
`git fetch --all --tags && git checkout N.1.6.3.1 && git reset --hard N.1.6.3.1`


[30-Apr-19 05:10 AM] arweave-martin#1169
A change is added to `master` before we start testing it in larger scale on our nodes, so bugs do end up there every now and then. E.g. right now there is a bug in master which we are finishing a fix for today.


[30-Apr-19 05:11 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Got it. So this node should be on latest release now instead of master.

@arweave-sam yes, updated on the 10th of April, any new updates since then ? but hey If i can't mine anymore, I'll just shut it down, no drama.


[03-May-19 03:09 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@courtcircuit When you go to `http://127.0.0.1:1984` in your browser on your miner what is the `release` number?


[04-May-19 12:37 AM] courtcircuit#8002
@arweave-sam  here "arweave.N.1","version":5,"release":23

other than tcp port 1984 does Arweave require specific ports are open to the server?


[08-May-19 07:14 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Nope! Just 1984


[11-May-19 10:15 PM] chriscord#4741
Is it possible to run multiple miners on a single server on different ports? I think I've come across at least one server configured like that


[12-May-19 01:37 AM] ivhturp#3325
That must be port forwarding on single external ip to multiple servers


[12-May-19 11:55 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You can use custom ports to run multiple nodes on a single server, yes @chriscord


[12-May-19 03:34 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Why would anyone want to do that?


[12-May-19 03:34 PM] Vilenarios#8742
run multiple beam.smp on one node?


[12-May-19 04:11 PM] vitosfizik#9289
And if I have one modem, with him connected a few computers running miners, I need for all PCs forward the port 1984?


[12-May-19 04:17 PM] arweave-lev#3466
@vitosfizik each PC should use its own port (you can specify it in the command line via `port [PORT]`) and then you forward requests to the corresponding ports to the corresponding PCs.


[12-May-19 04:41 PM] vitosfizik#9289
ie I have to redirect the port 1984, for example, on the 1985 port for the second PC?


[12-May-19 04:43 PM] arweave-lev#3466
for the second PC you then need to redirect 1985 to 1985

[13-May-19 02:52 PM] vitosfizik#9289
It's ok?


[14-May-19 02:30 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@vitosfizik The logfile is not just for errors. In this case it just "INFO REPORT" which can be used for debugging. So in this case it's fine as long as the managed to join the network.


[14-May-19 02:31 AM] arweave-martin#1169
We have replaced a few of our own nodes, which is the reason you get these log message.

[14-May-19 03:08 AM] rehash#3438
why not just create DNS entries for peers.arweave.net instead of keep uploading the document?


[14-May-19 03:13 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@rehash That's a good idea and we have thought about it. It would also make sense to let the miner remember its peers during restart.


[14-May-19 03:16 AM] rehash#3438
or just create 10 official peers peer1.arweave.net peer2.arweave.net


[14-May-19 03:23 AM] arweave-martin#1169
That's also a good idea but we need to add support for hostnames in the miner software first.

It could be cool if arweave.net could support additional friendly paths for apps maybe - eg, arweave.net/weavewatcher

Although I guess technically anyone could get their own domain and point it to their AR nodes

[16-May-19 12:57 PM] Zeus#2212
it checks automatically the apps you have when you're logged in and show the apps as "My links"


[16-May-19 12:58 PM] Zeus#2212
since we talked @arweave-sam I think the best way to guarantee "updates" for the links is to have every "owner" of a link to be the only one allowed to publish that one


[16-May-19 12:58 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Makes sense


[16-May-19 12:58 PM] Zeus#2212
http://prntscr.com/npha29


[16-May-19 12:58 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Maybe `owner` should be defined by the key used to publish the app?


[16-May-19 12:58 PM] arweave-sam#9630
That is pretty definitive


[16-May-19 12:58 PM] Zeus#2212
yep that's what it's being used  


[16-May-19 12:58 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Nice!


[16-May-19 12:59 PM] Zeus#2212
and in that way, an owner can just publish again the same app and it will only show the latest published one with that same ID

Hey, what are the rewards for mining?


[19-May-19 11:31 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Ririen  The reward decreases smoothly in every block, from 5.5mAR in total in the first year, 2.75mAR in the second, etc


[19-May-19 11:32 AM] arweave-stan#3973
In total 11m AR will be printed


[19-May-19 01:25 PM] Ririen#7687
Only how is it calculated? Reward for the block, for keeping the node, randomness or what?


[19-May-19 01:26 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It is a block reward + a portion of the TX reward pool


[19-May-19 01:26 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@Ririen


[19-May-19 01:30 PM] Ririen#7687
And what is the prize for the block? It can not be seen in Explorer. There are also no transactions related to this, only the amount of AR is shown.


[19-May-19 01:32 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yes, we don't generate a transaction for mining rewards in order to avoid the bloat


[19-May-19 01:33 PM] arweave-sam#9630
The block reward for the last block, for example, was 30.3 AR

Heads up: my miner on Amazon EC2 received an abuse report again. Just like a month ago, a fake abuse that couldn’t possibly be true, trying to ssh as root on other machines. This time the alleged abuse took place on May 8. Anyway, I will answer because if you don’t answer they can isolate or shutdown your EC2 instance.

@lvb yes, fake abuse reports started again


[21-May-19 05:41 AM] lvb#9709
@ivhturp This time they mentioned the IP address of the server that was the target of the alleged abuse by my EC2 instance. In the previous cases this wasn’t mentioned. It’s an IP address located  in the UK, if the admins are interested I can send it by private message.

Hi.
My server has 12 cores, how many cores it is better to use for mining?


[22-May-19 12:12 PM] vitosfizik#9289
And why at every startup I get the message:

What do they mean?
Can I get them, because I'm do not have a static ip?


[22-May-19 12:18 PM] arweave-lev#3466
@vitosfizik  You can disregard these messages. Regarding the cores, by default it should mine on 11 cores in your case, but you can try 12 (`max_miners 12`). You can benchmark them (`./arweave-server benchmark max_miners 12`), note that you need to stop the miner before running the benchmark tool.

The result is good, but the server for 4 days, only got 1 block, I thought maybe more free cores to leave?


[22-May-19 12:25 PM] arweave-lev#3466
1 core should be more than enough to do all the bookkeping. Also, the scheduler prioritises incoming blocks even if all cores are mining. So I doubt having more free cores would increase the rewards.

A follow-up on my previous post regarding the 'node_worker_error':

I continued to encounter the error after a couple of more tries to launch the node, however after hard resetting the VM the error stopped and is now working fine. I haven't checked thoroughly for the cause because I didn't have time but maybe there was a memory leak or something. I'll be sure to check properly if it happens again

[23-May-19 04:59 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@solidity coder  welcome . The mainnet was launched on 8th June, 2018.  There are approximately 26m in circulation of which 3.78m mined as block rewards, 55m is the total supply from the genesis block, and  11m for mining, maximum supply is 66m. And our protocol is proof of access. Thanks

approximately?


[26-May-19 04:24 AM] Vilenarios#8742
128GB drive partition would be more than enough for now.


[26-May-19 04:24 AM] Vilenarios#8742
64GB will be too small.

ah ok great thanks


[26-May-19 04:28 AM] shiggidy#4554
is there stats on total coins circulating and max somewhere?


[26-May-19 04:32 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@shiggidy  There are approximately 26m in circulation of which 3.78m mined as block rewards.  55m is the total supply from the genesis block, 11m for mining. The maximum supply is 66m.


[26-May-19 04:33 AM] shiggidy#4554
oh... ok confused so if only 11m is availble for mining and theres already 26m in circulation


[26-May-19 04:33 AM] shiggidy#4554
where does the other 40m come from?


[26-May-19 04:34 AM] shiggidy#4554
oh


[26-May-19 04:35 AM] shiggidy#4554
55m from genesis block


[26-May-19 04:35 AM] shiggidy#4554
where is that going to?


[26-May-19 04:41 AM] arweave-stan#3973
38.5% of the 55m was sold during the token sale, 2.9% for advisors, 13% for team, 19.1% for development of Arweave ecosystem and 26.5% for future use of the project. 11m for mining.

For the 11m mining rewards, the reward decreases smoothly in every block, from 5.5mAR in total in the first year, 2.75mAR in the second, etc

@Viktor Node's wildfire score is based on a node's IP. Whenever IP changes, wildfire score starts from 0. As a result, your node may have delay in getting new blocks


[08-Jan-18 05:11 AM] tierralibre#2740
I have been looking at the code I come from elixir. Trying to understand how the message passing works in a real network. Because I see messages are being passed between process. But this I assume can not happen when the network is distributed. How is that done? Just using the HTTP API?


[08-Jan-18 08:28 AM] Marcin#0065
Hey Guys, have you decided what algorithm you gonna use? U mentioned cuckoo cycle or other memory bandwith depdndant alg. Any news on that?


[08-Jan-18 12:18 PM] WillRogerJones#8527
@tierralibre Yes! This is actually quite an interesting part of the architecture. Essentially our message gossiping library (ar_gossip) has a bridge that allows the sending of messages between machines in the network (through the HTTP interface you mention). This means that sending messages between miners, apps, and services inside a single node is the same as sending messages to remote nodes, from the standpoint of the programmer. This has numerous benefits, particularly in the development of Archain apps.

@Marcin: We are still considering this, as it is an important decision (although the necessary edits to the codebase are small). We will let you know when we come to a conclusion!


[08-Jan-18 12:24 PM] tierralibre#2740
this is what I was trying to understand.   as well I am trying to see how I can use elixir to develop archain. is a very clean language


[08-Jan-18 12:24 PM] tierralibre#2740
I actually was surprised that erlang does not look as scary after elixir  


[08-Jan-18 12:25 PM] tierralibre#2740

Hey guys, is there any update about the mining algorithm? what are your thoughts? what is the best/fairest one? There are many Projects around using computing power for scientific research, which allows almost any kind of computer device take part in it. Do you think archain could use that too? woudl suck, if big mining farms would dominate and influence the project :/


[16-Jan-18 10:59 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Hi @Marcin


[16-Jan-18 10:59 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
We've actually been talking about this a lot between ourselves, it's a very interesting question


[16-Jan-18 11:00 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
We too, see the problem of the centralisation of of computing power as a real potential problem - particularaly in a project such as Archain that is so reliant on geographic distribution for security


[16-Jan-18 11:01 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Not that SHA2 doesn't offer benefits though - it's been extensively tried and tested and to some extent, the best way to defend the network is to have all of this hashing power because it makes a 51% attack so much harder to pull off


[16-Jan-18 11:03 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Another problem with SHA is the longevity of the project


[16-Jan-18 11:03 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
We want Archain to be able to be up and running in 50 years or 100 years


[16-Jan-18 11:03 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
SHA might be the most widely used hashing algorithm at the moment, but I really doubt it's going to last that long


[16-Jan-18 11:03 AM] tierralibre#2740
then u need quantum level security


[16-Jan-18 11:04 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Yes, that would be ideal :p


[16-Jan-18 11:04 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
One alternative we considered is cuckoo cycle


[16-Jan-18 11:06 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Since it's based on finding cycles in graphs, it's a very difficult problem to crack even with advanced computing power


[16-Jan-18 11:07 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
and ultimately, its constrained by bus size


[16-Jan-18 11:07 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Making it very difficult to create any kind of specialist hardware


[16-Jan-18 11:08 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
However, I believe that the way the graphs are generated using hashing, so we'll have to think very carefully about that long term


[16-Jan-18 11:18 AM] Marcin#0065
One question to fairness issues: if people let compute their smaller private systems for archain, but wont mine anything because other have more and stronger hardware, how will that be motivation for all the „smaller“ budgeted people to join the network? Is there any kind of technical possibility to track the „hash-rate“ over time and give any rewards just for letting compute small devices? I hope you understand my english  


[16-Jan-18 11:23 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Yeah, this has always been a concern with SHA - we don't necesarrily think that it's heathy for the network to be dominated by a few large miners. As I said though, there are advantages to getting lots of hashing power on the network so we don't want to rule it out until we've carefully looked through all our choices.


[16-Jan-18 11:24 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
To some extent though, particularaly as the network grows, the hashing component becomes a less important part of the mining


[16-Jan-18 11:25 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
When the network is particularaly large, the best way to complete in mining is to simply have very large amounts of storage space - something that is much cheaper than specialised hashing hardware


[16-Jan-18 11:30 AM] tierralibre#2740
what about data bandwidth?  as a distributed hard drive, access to the data is important. how does the access work? when you query the  network?,


[16-Jan-18 11:32 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Yes, you'll need to query the network to get the data


[16-Jan-18 11:32 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
We actually have a great system to do this, details will be in our yellow paper

Hey @Marcin, BATN.3 actually runs on Windows, but only through the 'Windows Subsystem for Linux' which takes a little configuring. Proper Windows/Mac support is on the list for ATN.1, as is the final mining algorithm :-). We are leaning heavily towards Cuckoo Cycle but still have a few behaviours that we want to check.

It definitely works inside a VM, but performance will be slightly reduced (depending on whether your VMM/CPU has hypervisor extension support).

Hi Sam,  I got some S9 and D3 at my disposal - sha would therefore work with me. Final algo will be interesting though..   sha has monopoly danger,.. x11 maybe too, but could help spread fast since all d3 miners are speculation devices currently since dash rewards are dead. Whatever the profitability, I would love to support growth of the network. I believe India should have written a ticket for an email reply. I’d be interested in some details like block time and reward and such.. Do you have a dev/miner-log/faq for that? I’m sure I’m not the only one and first to ask. Greetings from Switzerland

[07-Apr-18 02:37 PM] digamma889#3785
Let me start by saying I'm no expert but as Arweave is focussing on the long long term it is probably going to face the introduction of stable quantum computing and the requirement to upgrade the cryptographic hash functions (as SHA-256 is being used if I'm correct) to post quantum secure hash functions.
Is this something that has crossed your minds already?


[09-Apr-18 04:45 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hi @digamma889 , indeed it has! The answer is slightly broader though: how do we cope with breaks of the underlying cryptographic functions in general? Our approach is to have a system of 'tagging' of support for protocol change proposals in new blocks and transactions.

Users will be able to upload protocol upgrade proposals to the network (similar to RFCs, but with added implementation deadlines). Miners can then add 'tags' to their blocks that state their support (or dissent) for a given proposal (refered to by its Arweave TX ID). Users can also add tags to their transactions that signal similar support.

After network launch we will be running a website (a typical Arweave app node) that displays these support and dissent tags for the various proposals, allowing miners and users to decide if and when to implement the upgrades. Being open source, members of the community will be able to submit changes, fork, and run their own monitors that display the information in different forms.

So... in the context of quantum resistance, we expect that there will be at least some warning about when the problem is likely to arrive. At that time, the Arweave project will write a proposal regarding potential protocol upgrades (members of the community will be free to do the same), miners and users will 'vote with their feet' and the changes will be adopted once broad consensus (potentially after refinements) is reached.

guys, is there any more detailed instuction to join the network on windows, except the  quickstart in the readme?
i struggle with all the erlang stuff.

[18-Apr-18 10:31 AM] enilsen16#0335
Finally got a chance to experiment with some mining on the testnet.  Couple questions.

- Is there a way to log what's actually happening? I have the two info messages that my mining address is loaded but don't see anything else printing to console.
- If I have transactions and blocks can one assume that I have indeed successfully connected to the network?


[19-Apr-18 12:46 PM] WillRogerJones#8527
Hi @enilsen16, certainly!


[19-Apr-18 12:47 PM] WillRogerJones#8527
Open up a terminal in the same directory as the arweave server, and run "make log"


[19-Apr-18 12:48 PM] WillRogerJones#8527
This will print out the log file to the terminal in real time


[19-Apr-18 12:49 PM] WillRogerJones#8527
If you're getting blocks and transactions, it's very likely you're connected - but the log should tell you for certain


[19-Apr-18 12:51 PM] WillRogerJones#8527
Hi @Marcin, what is it that's causing you problems?


[19-Apr-18 12:53 PM] WillRogerJones#8527
If you let me know, I'll help you out and we'll update the instructions so nobody else gets stuck on the same issue


[19-Apr-18 05:32 PM] Marcin#0065
Hey will. 
Im wouldnt consider myself a pc noob, more an usual pc who spent more time on pcs than others maybe. 
But i either know what erlang is for and i havent used it before. 
Maybe an idiot proof step by step tutorial would be nice. I think its important to have a windows version running. You need a good start to gain accetance. 
For ne it isnt a problem to fire up linux an mine successfully on it. With some help i got it running long time ago already.  So ither will do it on linuy too. 
But i know most potential miners or just curious people who wanna join to just try out wont make the effort to get linux first. Im afraid u will miss out a big group of people joining the network then. And that would suck. The very best would be some kind of self executing file, follwed by an installer asking for the path for the downloaded blocks. Most bullcrap peojects got so much attention coz of easy pool mining or easy mining software aka cminer. I have tried out all kind of mining possible till today i guess and struggled a lot many times. But somehow got it going. It was all just for fun. But boy, i dont know if i just miss out sonething here, probably yes, but i cant get it working with that description for windows. I dont know what specific programs i need to download and how to get them started correctly. The information: "get erlang and all the other stuff and run it" isnt precise enough to me so far. Sry for my english.


[20-Apr-18 02:59 AM] enilsen16#0335
@Marcin If you are running windows 10 you might be able to use the linux subsystem to install everything and get it up and running


[20-Apr-18 03:00 AM] enilsen16#0335

[20-Apr-18 07:25 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Hi @Marcin - okay, thanks for the feedback


[20-Apr-18 07:27 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
I'll update the instructions to make this more clear, and we'll perhaps think about pushing the installer higher up on our list of priorities


[27-Apr-18 07:07 AM] enilsen16#0335
>in the same directory as the arweave server, and run "make log"

Still only seems to log only when I first connect and any errors occur.


[27-Apr-18 07:09 AM] enilsen16#0335
@WillRogerJones Is there anyway to log debug info as well? I guess I could write an application to do this, but I should be able to log new transactions and new blocks be stored/confirmed


[27-Apr-18 07:09 AM] enilsen16#0335
From what I can tell, the blocks that I hold onto locally also seem to change.


[27-Apr-18 07:09 AM] enilsen16#0335
Is there a strategy onto how this works?


[27-Apr-18 07:09 AM] enilsen16#0335
Thanks!


[30-Apr-18 12:41 PM] WillRogerJones#8527
Hi @enilsen16 . Are you running this from a static IP address? If not, you might have some difficulty getting blocks and transactions. If this is a problem, try using the polling flag when starting the server.


[02-May-18 07:47 AM] enilsen16#0335
Yeah I only set one ip as a peer. Should I be providing more? Is there a way to connect to nodes dynamically as the network grows?


[02-May-18 08:17 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
You should have an easaier time getting blocks if you provide more peers - if you provide none then at the moment you'll connect to the core 8 of our test network


[02-May-18 08:18 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
The system should dynamically add peers on its own as the network grows through a system we call wildfire


[02-May-18 08:19 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
See an early version of our lightpaper describing is here: https://www.arweave.org/files/arweave-lightpaper.pdf


[02-May-18 08:19 AM] enilsen16#0335
oh ok. I see. It would be nice if all these things were logged by default


[02-May-18 08:19 AM] enilsen16#0335
I'll take a look at the lightpaper


[02-May-18 10:21 AM] enilsen16#0335
Ah ok, I see how wildfire works. The gossip protocol uses distributed erlang underneath then? Is it possible to see ones wildfire rating right now?


[02-May-18 10:22 AM] enilsen16#0335
Thanks for answering all my questions so far @WillRogerJones


[02-May-18 10:24 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
No problem, glad to talk!


[02-May-18 10:24 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Wildfire is ordinal instead of cardinal - theres not a rating as such, just a rank order


[02-May-18 10:25 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
I believe you can get your own rankings of peers - though I doubt its very nicely formatted at the moment


[02-May-18 10:25 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
You can't see other peoples though - we've considered it but we're worried about people using it to game the system


[02-May-18 10:27 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Oh, also - other question


[02-May-18 10:28 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
No, we're notn using the erlang distribution messaging protocol underneath


[02-May-18 10:28 AM] enilsen16#0335
Oh? is it something custom?


[02-May-18 10:29 AM] enilsen16#0335
Would be cool to see partisan used underneath. Since it already supports thousands of nodes


[02-May-18 10:38 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
At the moment, in terms of gossiping between nodes, we're actually using http for communication - this is particularaly nice for anybody trying to interface with the system.


[03-May-18 02:36 AM] enilsen16#0335
Oh ok interesting. It'd be cool if this kind of information was documented somewhere. Maybe like an rfc repo?


[03-May-18 05:33 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Yeah. We're looking to write a yellow paper about all of this in detail, though we're a little busy with net launch in the near future.


[06-May-18 10:17 AM] enilsen16#0335
I submitted a PR to clean up some files. As I was navigating around I noticed a lot of extra spaces.


[06-May-18 10:19 AM] enilsen16#0335
@WillRogerJones I figured out how to see a list of peers, but is this correct?


[06-May-18 10:20 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Sorry, what do you mean?

There doesn't seem to be a lot of info in them regarding transfer speed

Is it possible to programatically generate Arweave wallet addresses or get the current public key from the browser extension?


[07-May-18 01:44 PM] WillRogerJones#8527
It isn't possible to generate new addresses from the web extension at the moment, though we'll add this feature in before launch


[07-May-18 01:45 PM] vimal.s08#6053
Are the two equal signs part of the key??

[07-May-18 01:46 PM] WillRogerJones#8527

@WillRogerJones  what if I want to get the user public key automatically? Is there a javascript library to interact with the browser extension? How do I generate the ID to post a transaction?


[08-May-18 03:46 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
For the first two questions, not yet though we plan to add something like this. With respect to the ID, currently you can simply pick 32 random bytes to generate the ID - but before net launch, this will become a hash of the tx.

[14-May-18 06:51 AM] mattr#1108
hi how would somebody go from an existing project on ethereum network eg to adding the data aspect into the arweave platform.  So for eg there are some existing projects that have only put a small fraction of there data on to the block chain due to its limitations and have found arweave and would like to store massive amounts of data. what would be the processs would the 2 systems co exist or would it be a complete replacement.  thanks


[14-May-18 06:53 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hey @mattr 

@WillRogerJones Perhaps you can take a look at addressing this? Thanks!


[14-May-18 06:54 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
_


[14-May-18 06:55 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
I would imagine the two systems would co-exist, but it probably depends on the project a bit


[14-May-18 06:55 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Arweave is very useful and provides the massive data storage that some projects need, but sometimes there is just no substitute for having data locally


[14-May-18 07:02 AM] mattr#1108
I think from some of the discussions I've had with other people in other projects knowing what criteria you would use the arweave would help for adoption.  do you have a list of projects that you would think that they could use your service as they would like to go more decentralised.


[14-May-18 07:08 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
I think most projects could use the Arweave to some degree, though in general it would only make sense to do so if you have a meaningful amount of data to store. NXT, for example, show that you can manage storage of data on a traditional blockchain data structure, as long as the size is quite limited.

A perfect example of a project that is exceptionally suited to the Arweave is the jounral of raw data who we are working with - see: http://thejournalofrawdata.org/JoRD_v100.pdf


[14-May-18 07:12 AM] mattr#1108
ok thanks.  there are a few project that claim to be the Wordpress for block chain that maybe could use the system.  what about video storage for example.


[14-May-18 07:35 AM] CryptoLamer#0730
Hi, Arweave team! I'm in progress of making review and have some questions for you.

Does arweave support smart contracts?

And if it does how often contracts is created? I mean isn't it uneconomical to create and update contract for every download and upload of files? How is the payment process going between renter of storage place and the host?

Why is your structure cheaper than in  sia and filecoin for example? I don't  quite understand from lightpaper.

Thank You


[14-May-18 06:03 PM] Vadim | NEAR#8313
@WillRogerJones could you please answer to previous message?


[15-May-18 03:20 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
@mattr  Yes! Those are exactly the kind of projects we see Arweave being useful for.


@Vadim | NEAR l, Of course, sorry for the wait.

There are no such things as smart contracts in Arweave at the moment. Storage in Arweave isn't based on the renting storage model that filecoin and sia are, it's based on a new model that utlises our new Proof of Access algorithm. In short, it incentivises storage of old data by making it a necessary requirement for mining new blocks.

It's this structure that makes us unique from sia and filecoin, and that lets us provide better prices for long term file storage.


[15-May-18 09:56 AM] mattr#1108
had a conversation with a cto of another project today I was asking about there data storage.  the blockchain is not good for heavy and chunky files. So it might be a hybrid or cold storage at some point. But wouldn't be very feasible on a public blockchain for the content itself.  we're still evaluating options - but right now it's looking like leveraging the public ethereum chain is not the best way to go due to gas charges. we're looking at a few options, all would be linked back to the public mainnet by way of hash or something similar. options include 1) IPFS or other flat file storage, 2) some distributed DB such as bigchaindb or bluzelle, 3) running a private net in parallel.  so I let them know about your project.


[15-May-18 10:53 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Thats great, thank you - by the sounds of things they're exactly the kind of people who would benefit from working with usa


[17-May-18 11:58 AM] helloworld#5874
Repost from telegram (India Raybould addresed me to ask about it here):  "Transaction throughput scales directly with link quality. When network infrastructure improves, the maximum TPS will improve too." (Sam Williams) Ok. So you don't have any other solution to scale up. You entirely depend on the quality of existing network links of the nodes. But at the moment (as 5g is still on the way) 100 mbps links between pcs, if you are not an enterprise or data provider, are rare I think. Do you have any research on this? And another problem: how you will sync nodes abroad? For example, my speed to my local provider is around 100 mbps, but when I connect to somebody, for example in USA, I got usually only 2-3mbps. So I think that total TPS limit will be much lower than theoretical 5000. Am I missing something? Or just don't know? And what is the current transactions per second in testnets?


[18-May-18 05:30 AM] mattr#1108
do you have plans to integrate with any other blockchains that are building joined up  infrastructure and being the storage part of that eco system.


[18-May-18 06:14 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
hi @helloworld 

No, you're not missing anything. 5000 TPS - or even more - is certainly possible in a well connected network as described, but you're correct in saying that we can't break the laws of physics; with a 1mb/s connection we certainly can't push 5000 transactions at a few kilobytes to the whole network every second.

Our testnets are a good example, as you say. This is a much less optimal environment with many participants with poor connections, and I wouldn't expect the upper limit to be able to exceed 100-200 TPS - depending on the connection strengths of our participants.


[18-May-18 06:15 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
@mattr mattr Yes! We've got several partnerships in the works here, keep an eye on our blog for more details about these.


[18-May-18 06:40 AM] helloworld#5874
@WillRogerJones  Thanks for the honest answer. Any ideas how to scale up? I mean that your vision is very interesting, and that you need to pay only once is good. But if you succeed, then the popularity of your solution will go high. What would you do then, if you need, say, 10000 tps for smooth work of the chain? I understand that in nowdays 100-200 tps is good speed for blockchain, and that you already have real application is good. But what next?  


[19-May-18 01:57 AM] mattr#1108
@WillRogerJones great really good you have some projects I've been looking at these.  I was thinking along a few different lines.  one being how do you get mass adoption of the system and blockchain. So for example seele project have one element the heterogenous forest which enables block chains to form a network and use the services.  A new project cardstack are building a top down layer for utilising different apps and service of blockchains in one interface.  When you use AWS you get a whole bunch of services that are all under one company so effectively for mass adoption this will need to be replicated in some way whilst staying decentralised and the individual  companies existing in there own right.  another option would be if all the raspberry pi owners who own them and there not being used could become part of the network.  what would this function like if millions of devices are connected with lets say 16G of hard disk space.


[19-May-18 07:53 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
@helloworld if arweave saw an explosion of popularity like that without a growth in infrastructure to match, we'd have two choices I think - we'd either have to beef up the network infrastructure by making sure enough key nodes are strongly connected, or we'd have to innovate


[19-May-18 07:54 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
That said, if we start getting in a position in which transaction throughput is an issue at these levels, I think we'd have the resources to do both!


[19-May-18 07:59 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
@mattr interesting idea. With respect to many small nodes My best guess is that in a setup like that, a nodes connectivity becomes as much of a limiting factor as it's hashing power, perhaps even more so. Might be nice if you're interested in ASIC resistance


[20-May-18 12:32 PM] Midriaz#2898
Hello! Following @helloworld i am interested in speed of reading the data from ARweave. Unfortunately, i can't find in lightpaper technical details on how a data will be stored in the ARweave. I suppose that nodes won't store all data, but "shards" of the data. Is it true? Does Arweave team plan to publish a whitepaper where more details can be found?


[22-May-18 09:14 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Hi @Midriaz ,

Sharind in arweave is at the level of blocks, which are also where Arweaves data is stored. Miners need only hold a very small number of the most recent blocks in order to be able to verify new blocks.

And yeah, we will in the future release a much more detailed, full paper, that sets everything out in a lot more detail. This will be after network launch, however.

[23-May-18 06:08 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Hi @patrick , the IPs to mine on the arweave testnet are already hard coded into the testing servers


[23-May-18 06:09 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
you can join by simply running ./arweave-server mine


[23-May-18 10:51 AM] patrick#8648
Hey all! Can anyone help me on the linux instruction, one needs a peer IP to be able to mine on the testnet. "Don’t forget to change xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx to the IP address you should have received in the backer email you received on November the 7th." Is it still possible to get one


[23-May-18 10:51 AM] patrick#8648
?


[23-May-18 10:52 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Hi @patrick, as I said, in the current version of the testnet you should not need to do this


[23-May-18 10:52 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
To help users, we've simply made it so typing ./arweave-server mine should work


[23-May-18 10:53 AM] patrick#8648
awesone thanks will


[23-May-18 10:53 AM] WillRogerJones#8527

139.59.81.47.198


[24-May-18 01:41 PM] tierralibre#2740
so we all can join the testnet? even if we don't have tokens


[24-May-18 01:41 PM] tierralibre#2740
or is only for the first supporters of the first round a few months ago?

just install the node and start mining?


[24-May-18 04:57 PM] tierralibre#2740
great. thank you


[24-May-18 04:57 PM] tierralibre#2740
I want to test it. as I want to deploy nodes for mainnet


[24-May-18 04:57 PM] arweave-india#5075
Yes I believe so - if you do have further questions definitely post them here and the dev team will help you out!

That sounds great!


[24-May-18 04:57 PM] tierralibre#2740
I really believe in Arweave. and I find your approach, pragmatic and fair. I have a lot of respect on how you have put together real code with a little team.


[24-May-18 04:58 PM] tierralibre#2740
Is really nice to see in this blockchain bubble. Some sanity.


[24-May-18 04:58 PM] arweave-india#5075
Aw, thanks! I am glad you approve   We've always been about the actual product to be honest, we genuinely want the best thing for the community  


[24-May-18 04:58 PM] tierralibre#2740
and erlang VM is perfect for this tech.


[24-May-18 04:59 PM] tierralibre#2740
keep up the amazing work!


[24-May-18 04:59 PM] arweave-india#5075
Thank you very much for the support!!


[24-May-18 05:00 PM] arweave-india#5075
Just FYI (in case you hadn't heard) as you mentioned that you missed the original sale by a few days, if you want to apply for the final sale whitelist you have until 25th May 1800 CEST to submit the two stages of the whitelist application process. 

Absolutely no worries if you're not interested, but I just wanted to mention it just in case


[24-May-18 05:00 PM] tierralibre#2740
I got in in the community 1  


[24-May-18 05:00 PM] arweave-india#5075
Ah that's awesome news


[24-May-18 05:00 PM] tierralibre#2740
I was talking about the first, first now  


[24-May-18 05:01 PM] arweave-india#5075
Cool cool  


[24-May-18 05:01 PM] tierralibre#2740
Thank you!


[24-May-18 05:01 PM] tierralibre#2740
as far as I am concern. Worst case scenario, I got long term distributed storage credit  


[24-May-18 05:01 PM] tierralibre#2740
it has a real value arweave


[24-May-18 05:02 PM] arweave-india#5075
For sure!


[24-May-18 06:00 PM] tierralibre#2740
so I launched a node. Now, how do I test it? How do I know is mining? How do I add a file?


[24-May-18 09:01 PM] Krypto Light#1198
Hi, may I rise to technical questions here?


[25-May-18 06:51 AM] arweave-india#5075
@tierralibre  I'll let @WillRogerJones answer that one  


[25-May-18 06:51 AM] arweave-india#5075
@Krypto Light Yep, you can, either here in # dev or in #tech-support  


[25-May-18 09:07 AM] Krypto Light#1198
Due to the lightpaper quite short, I am confusing at some points

1. In the blockweave, do you store the detail of all transactions or only store the list of hash values of previous blocks and wallets?

2. Assume that I have a text file, where do you store my file? blockweare or node or local?

3. You mention that the miner no need to store full blockweare, who will maintain the full blockweave? 

4. Could you please explain the claimed: "As the amount of data stored in the system increases, the amount of hashing needed for consensus decreases, thus reducing the cost of storing data"

5. Could you please explain more about PoA? What is the role of "recall block"?

Thank you so much!


[26-May-18 05:18 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
@tierralibre 

We've actually just pushed a major update to the master version of Arweave, so make sure you have the most recent copy of the code!

Other than that, you can start mining by simply using the command:

./arweave-server mine

This should connect you to the main network and let you begin mining. In terms of posting data, I'd recommend using the web extension or the archiveit tools, though you may need to wait a few days for them to be updated to work with the new version of the source code.


[26-May-18 05:21 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
@Krypto Light 

1. The blockweave stores details of all transactions, and the list of hash values of previous blocks and active wallets

2. If you archived the file using Arweave, the data w2ould be stored in the blocks of the weave themselves

3. An even storage of the blockweave is maintained by financial pressure - the less widely mirrored a block is, the more financial profitable it is to store it

4. As the amount of data on the weave increases, the average number of miners mirroring each piece of data decreases. This means that the number of miners who have access to this data should it arise as a recall block is smaller, and equally, so is the amount of total hashing power contributed toward mining it. This means that, as the amount of data increases, so to does the amount of hashing per block decrease.

5. The role of the recall block is to provide an incentive for miners to store old data in the weave.


[26-May-18 06:05 AM] tierralibre#2740
thank you @WillRogerJones  I have just updated to the latest master

ok it seems to be the port I guess ,eaddrinuse


[26-May-18 06:06 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Are you running this on windows or unix?


[26-May-18 06:06 AM] tierralibre#2740
linux ubuntu 16.04


[26-May-18 06:06 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Okay


[26-May-18 06:06 AM] tierralibre#2740
let me kill all previous beams first and try again


[26-May-18 06:06 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Excellent idea


[26-May-18 06:07 AM] tierralibre#2740
ok now it started I get a progress report.


[26-May-18 06:08 AM] tierralibre#2740
so if use just mine instead of explicitly giving it an address


[26-May-18 06:08 AM] tierralibre#2740
what is the standard behaviour?


[26-May-18 06:08 AM] tierralibre#2740
it creates the keys and wallets for me?


[26-May-18 06:08 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
I believe it generates you a new wallet


[26-May-18 06:08 AM] tierralibre#2740
how do I know what that wallet is?


[26-May-18 06:08 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
if you go into the wallet subfolder, you should have a keyfile


[26-May-18 06:08 AM] tierralibre#2740
and how can i tell if I am getting any balance on my wallet that I can use to test the uploads


[26-May-18 06:09 AM] tierralibre#2740
I have a bunch of keys there


[26-May-18 06:09 AM] tierralibre#2740
I have been testing this for a few days


[26-May-18 06:09 AM] tierralibre#2740
I guess by checking at the date I can figure that out


[26-May-18 06:09 AM] tierralibre#2740
how can I tell about the balance? to see if I am getting any rewards for mining


[26-May-18 06:11 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Find your wallets address, and after you've mined a few blocks, check the wallet balance in the most recent block


[26-May-18 06:11 AM] tierralibre#2740
the log just stayed on the last status report and nothing else is happening


[26-May-18 06:11 AM] tierralibre#2740
how do I know that I mined a few blocks?


[26-May-18 06:11 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Open up a new terminal in the same directory and run: make log


[26-May-18 06:12 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
this should give you a live feed of what is being written to the log file


[26-May-18 06:13 AM] tierralibre#2740

Looks like you've joined the main network to me


[26-May-18 06:13 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
I'm actually playing around with it just now, I can probably see you connecting in the log


[26-May-18 06:13 AM] tierralibre#2740
I use screen when I launche arweave it allows to detach from that program


[26-May-18 06:13 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Excellent


[26-May-18 06:14 AM] tierralibre#2740
what I am trying to test. is to call the api to transact


[26-May-18 06:14 AM] tierralibre#2740
this is why I though let me start mining so I can get something I can use


[26-May-18 06:15 AM] tierralibre#2740
as well I intend to deploy 5-10 nodes  for mainnet.  So testing all the set up now


[26-May-18 06:15 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
You're welcome to start now, but we're going to overhaul the net in a few days - might be better to wait till the start of next week


[26-May-18 06:16 AM] tierralibre#2740
ok. I still I am not sure when I am mining. I guess to mine somebody needs to transacting


[26-May-18 06:16 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Oh, one thought - do you have a static IP?


[26-May-18 06:16 AM] tierralibre#2740
yes


[26-May-18 06:16 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Okay, great


[26-May-18 06:16 AM] tierralibre#2740
I put a little node in aws


[26-May-18 06:17 AM] tierralibre#2740
I can share the ip


[26-May-18 06:17 AM] tierralibre#2740
if you want


[26-May-18 06:17 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
I think I already have it from when you connected!


[26-May-18 06:18 AM] tierralibre#2740
35.180.86.40


[26-May-18 06:18 AM] tierralibre#2740
is just a test server I will re do later


[26-May-18 06:18 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Anyway, I'd wait a few days. Something resembling the setup of the main network should be out then, with a few more fixes to the code.


[26-May-18 06:19 AM] tierralibre#2740
ok. great, thank you. have to test it out. I am trying to build a real app. For Environmental Services restoration


[26-May-18 06:19 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Nice!


[26-May-18 06:19 AM] tierralibre#2740
so I thought let's start by deploying nodes to understand


[26-May-18 06:20 AM] tierralibre#2740
I read the code too. I come from elixir, so erlang is understandable, but still a little difficult some times  


[26-May-18 06:20 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Ah cool. Hope the code quality been okay!


[26-May-18 06:20 AM] tierralibre#2740
is fantastic!


[26-May-18 06:21 AM] tierralibre#2740
so nice to see  a real innovation in this crypto crazyness.


[26-May-18 06:21 AM] tierralibre#2740
full of smoke ICO's with whitepapers that make no sense. and are just full of fuzz words


[26-May-18 06:22 AM] tierralibre#2740
Thank you! I will let the node on. And check in a few days.  


[26-May-18 06:22 AM] tierralibre#2740
I just got this now

[26-May-18 06:24 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
You don't have the recall block needed for the current block, and failed to retrieve it from your peers


[26-May-18 06:24 AM] tierralibre#2740
ok


[26-May-18 06:24 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Hmm, wonder if its because I'm messing around - sorry


[26-May-18 06:24 AM] tierralibre#2740
how can I get the recall block from my peers?


[26-May-18 06:24 AM] tierralibre#2740
is it automatic?


[26-May-18 06:25 AM] tierralibre#2740
I mean at this point there should not be many peers


[26-May-18 06:25 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
If its not the currently active recall block, they'll just share it with you


[26-May-18 06:25 AM] tierralibre#2740
so the net should be quite shared


[26-May-18 06:25 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
otherwise, they'll share an encrypted version and send you the key when they've finished mining


[26-May-18 06:26 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
This is to achieve the best we can do to get peers to share blocks willing to competitors


[26-May-18 06:26 AM] tierralibre#2740
very nice idea


[26-May-18 06:26 AM] tierralibre#2740
an potentially. a node could alter the code and change this rules?


[26-May-18 06:27 AM] tierralibre#2740
is there some kind of checksum of the code?


[26-May-18 06:27 AM] tierralibre#2740
on the version?


[26-May-18 06:27 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Nodes are welcome to change this rule if they want - it's entirely to their disadvantage to do so though


[26-May-18 06:28 AM] tierralibre#2740
how is that? is the network keeping track of nodes not sharing?


[26-May-18 06:28 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Oh, I see - they could not share at all you mean


[26-May-18 06:28 AM] tierralibre#2740
yes


[26-May-18 06:28 AM] tierralibre#2740
or they could never share the key


[26-May-18 06:28 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Yeah, they'd fall down the wildfire rankings of other peers


[26-May-18 06:28 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
and get pruned off for behaving badly


[26-May-18 06:28 AM] tierralibre#2740
nice


[26-May-18 06:29 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
not sharing the key would be entirely to their disadvantage too - you'd simply refuse to validate the block and they'd have wasted the effort mining it  :p


[26-May-18 06:29 AM] tierralibre#2740
this is going to become a social experiment  


[26-May-18 06:29 AM] tierralibre#2740

[26-May-18 06:30 AM] tierralibre#2740
any tips on where to start? on the code

hah, probably at sme point


[26-May-18 06:31 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Lightpapers a good start, manage peers is the module that deals with implementing most of it


[26-May-18 06:31 AM] tierralibre#2740
last time I check I did not see this wildfire. but that was some months ago


[26-May-18 06:31 AM] tierralibre#2740
I read the lightpaper and the old whitepaper


[26-May-18 06:31 AM] tierralibre#2740
and took  a look at all the code some months ago


[26-May-18 06:31 AM] tierralibre#2740
I don't recall seeing anything about wildfire


[26-May-18 06:31 AM] tierralibre#2740
I saw the gossip


[26-May-18 06:32 AM] WillRogerJones#8527

Could anybody recommend a good cloud mining service ? Preferable where you could choose a desires hash rate.
I would love to start mining with my own rig some day, but for now i think this might be a good alternative.
Suggestions are very welcome! Thank you


[27-May-18 03:12 PM] Marcin#0065
Hey devs, just reminding you that all the libks for your linux quickstart do not work. Furthermore you have all textfiles still filled with  "archain". Could be confusing


[28-May-18 04:30 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
@Marcin. Thanks - working on it - there's so much to do before launch!


[28-May-18 10:35 AM] chintangimli#7817
Hi.. I have a quick question.. with EOS, all we need to do is stake tokens in our wallet.. and claim bandwidth/storage on the network.. and access all dapps too..so how is Arweave better and what's the need?


[29-May-18 03:15 AM] enilsen16#0335
@chintangimli I'm not familar with EOS but arweave is sort a level lower (There are no dapps, though I guess you could create some kind of framework on top.). There's nothing stopping you from downloading the entire blockchain although that would/will require a lot of storage. Since we are saving data directly in a transaction blocks could be very very large.


[29-May-18 03:15 AM] enilsen16#0335
@WillRogerJones This could be a cool project to add an arweave api too - https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db


[29-May-18 08:11 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
@enilsen16 interesting, thanks. I'll take a look!


[31-May-18 06:55 PM] Aliaksandr#7787
@WillRogerJones , hi, do you have any instructions or links with at least high level guides about how to mine on testnet? thanks in advance


[02-Jun-18 12:17 AM] peitalin (Pe,P)#0935
Can anyone comment if blockshadow is similar to invertible bloom lookup tables?


[02-Jun-18 05:18 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Hi @Aliaksandr 
Check out our repository at https://github.com/arweaveteam/arweave, it should have some basic instructions to get you started in the readme. If you'd like more help, PM me.


[02-Jun-18 05:19 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
@peitalin (Pe,P) 
Blockshadows are a basically an invertible bloom lookup table of zero size. Instead of assuming that the number of differences in the two sets of transactions held by each node is small, arweave assumes it is zero. This is possible because Arweave nodes implement a delay before transactions are added to the pool to be mined, long enough that the assumption that each other node in the network is aware of all the transactions in my pool to be mined is highly certain.

Hi sorry to ask but does your team have any blockchain expertise? Can't find any team member on your website with blockchain expertise


[02-Jun-18 10:07 PM] Blasco#9303
Hi! ETA for mining? Will be pools for mining? Ty!

@WillRogerJones Im trying to run your github but all the time I see an error "Heartbeat: The Arweave server has terminated unsafely. It will restart in 15 se
conds." "Heartbeat: If you would like to avoid this, please press control+C now..."

[03-Jun-18 09:56 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
hi zavodil, what command are you running to start mining, and what error are you getting?


[03-Jun-18 11:04 AM] Vadim | NEAR#8313
@WillRogerJones  I can send error log it to you, how to do it?


[03-Jun-18 11:04 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
I've added you as a friend, feel free to message it to me


[04-Jun-18 08:38 AM] c1s0r#9150
Hi guys, I have some questions you can definitely help with.


[04-Jun-18 08:40 AM] c1s0r#9150
About storing documents on the blockchain, how are you safeguarding against malicious actors accessing people's documents? Even with encryption, it could be broken. And then if quantum computers go online, does that mean you'll have to re-еncrypt every file?


[05-Jun-18 03:27 AM] Cabbie66#4738
Hi Devs , interested in growing , helping and mining for the network , is there a write up anywhere regarding the requirements?


[05-Jun-18 11:11 AM] frknbbr#4498
Hi, how many AR need for run masternode?


[06-Jun-18 07:10 PM] Scalefinity#7851
@frknbbr. Arweave have a new consensus process. It's called proof of access. You don't need any arweave tokens to mine.


[07-Jun-18 09:41 AM] arweave-india#5075
Yes that's right - you don't need any AR tokens to mine so masternodes are a moot question really - feel free to check with Will for details about this


[07-Jun-18 02:20 PM] tierralibre#2740
what is the protocol to deplay some nodes tomorrow?


[07-Jun-18 02:20 PM] tierralibre#2740
are you going ta managed it through here in discord?


[07-Jun-18 02:20 PM] tierralibre#2740
to know when we can get the latest build and start mining.


[07-Jun-18 02:20 PM] tierralibre#2740
or can we already set up the system today.


[07-Jun-18 02:43 PM] arweave-india#5075
Sorry @tierralibre I'm not best placed to help you out with this 

Would you like me to add you to our mining mailing list for further communications on this, to make sure you receive the first instructions on this? If so feel free to PM me your email address. If PM is an issue here feel free to email me if you like - india@arweave.org


[07-Jun-18 03:40 PM] tierralibre#2740
yes, please add me to the mining list.


[07-Jun-18 03:41 PM] tierralibre#2740
I send you my email now on private


[07-Jun-18 10:24 PM] xlags#7723
@arweave-india can you put me on the mining mailing list please


[08-Jun-18 01:01 PM] saliljnr#2622
Hi guys... In  the mining instructions for linux on Github, there is this comment "Don’t forget to change xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx to the IP address you should have received in the backer email you received on November the 7th." <= What IP is this? Do I need to be on a static public IP in order to mine?


[08-Jun-18 01:03 PM] Mike#2447
@saliljnr That IP was provided exclusively to early backers and kept confidential.  We have to wait for the team to announce the new public IP(s).


[08-Jun-18 01:08 PM] saliljnr#2622
So can we mine then on Test Net without this IP?


[08-Jun-18 01:10 PM] Jinbin Xie Huobi Ventures#2044
Can i mine?


[08-Jun-18 02:15 PM] Scalefinity#7851
@Mike. I'm a early backer and I got no IP.
If the archain team launchs a public main blockchain, it should be decentralized and open to the public.
I'm not sure about this project any more.
I also don't understand how the consensus algorithm ensures that some entity make an 51% attack.
If you need only some VPS server, like 10.000 VPS amazon instances...  It become really easy to attack the system.


[08-Jun-18 02:24 PM] Mike#2447
@Scalefinity I am not part of the dev team.  Folks that contributed back in September 2017 were given an IP to play around with the test network and explore the technology.  There is no current advantage in having received that IP.  As for 51% protection, those questions need to be directed toward @WillRogerJones or @arweave-sam.


[08-Jun-18 02:36 PM] arweave-india#5075
@Scalefinity Yep don't worry - access to the IPs as mentioned in the blog post are not exclusive to backers any more at all


[08-Jun-18 02:37 PM] Scalefinity#7851
Thx.


[08-Jun-18 02:40 PM] arweave-india#5075
Ah @Scalefinity I think I understand now - you aren't missing any emails yet   


[08-Jun-18 02:42 PM] Scalefinity#7851
The last email was from 04.06.2018 (just KYC stuff).


[08-Jun-18 04:45 PM] chriscord#4741
Hello, where can I find information on mining?


[08-Jun-18 04:45 PM] chriscord#4741
Do I need a GPU or custom built computer to mine?


[08-Jun-18 04:48 PM] chriscord#4741
Ok, looks like it was posted on Medium


[08-Jun-18 04:50 PM] chriscord#4741
So it looks like I can run a script on an Ubuntu VPS and I’m good?


[08-Jun-18 04:50 PM] arweave-india#5075
Hey Chris - yes that's right - here's the basic instructions: https://medium.com/@arweave/batn-2-archiving-the-internet-3b0311ea8311

Bear in mind that the previously backer-exclusive IPs are void, and there's no exclusivity now - we'll be posting the new IPs soon

what are the IP's for he peers?


[08-Jun-18 05:11 PM] tierralibre#2740
@WillRogerJones  @arweave-india  what are the IP's?

I kind of want to go to bed.


[08-Jun-18 05:14 PM] arweave-india#5075
We will get you all the information you need to get mining shortly - I know you're on the mining mailing list already. We have a soft onboarding period for miners so the reward are very low right now, so you're not missing anything. You'll get plenty of time to set up your rig with our help wherever necessary

Thanks for your enthusiasm for the project!


[08-Jun-18 05:17 PM] tierralibre#2740
@arweave-india from a expectation management point of view. shortly has been since 4 hours ago. at this point I would prefer clear timings. If you told me 4 hours ago it will take 5 hours. I could have planned this time. Instead of keep watching.


[08-Jun-18 05:22 PM] Mike#2447
Kudos to India for showing extreme patience and staying in contact with everyone for the last many hours across several networks

Feels like several of us have servers up and running and awaiting Mainnet IPs, looking forward to hearing more about the process there  


[08-Jun-18 09:37 PM] chriscord#4741
Any ideas how GPU-intensive mining will be. Is it worth doing with a vanilla Linux machine?

Hi all! Congratulations everyone on the mainnet launch!!  


[08-Jun-18 11:37 PM] iBatman#2943
Is there any guide/article on how to get started with mining? Thank you  


[09-Jun-18 02:50 AM] DeanRey#5479

Does the code allow to manage multiple harddrives? What happens if one drive is full?


[18-Jun-18 03:34 AM] Marcin#0065
@arweave-sam  im planning to set up 5 drives, but do not wish to let them go in raid. Would pref to mount them on only. Is it possible to let your software manage those drive by itself?


[18-Jun-18 03:38 AM] themue#5527
So as a kind of stripe managed by the software? Sounds interesting.


[18-Jun-18 03:59 AM] Marcin#0065
Kind of :)


[18-Jun-18 04:00 AM] Marcin#0065
Since id like to add more drives later on


[18-Jun-18 04:01 AM] themue#5527
That's possible at RAID 0 too, data (files) is spread on all available disks. But only at a whole.


[18-Jun-18 04:02 AM] Marcin#0065
I dont like raid 0 :/


[18-Jun-18 04:04 AM] themue#5527
Hehe, not my favourite one, too. So you would prefer a flexible disk bundle w/o redundancy (but able to create it from chain again in case of a disk failure).


[18-Jun-18 04:05 AM] Marcin#0065
A simple set up like: "which drive you want to use for arweave?" And further more you could even specify how much space you want to reserve for each drive.


[18-Jun-18 04:05 AM] themue#5527
Top  


[18-Jun-18 04:06 AM] Marcin#0065
The disk failure is the key point in raid 0 to me too.


[18-Jun-18 04:07 AM] themue#5527
Sounds like a cool feature request.


[18-Jun-18 10:28 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Indeed -- some init options along the line of this might be good in future releases:
./arweave-server store /mnt/driveX/arweave 50g store /mnt/driveY/arweave 100g ...


[18-Jun-18 10:29 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Happy to take suggestions on the interface/setup requirements


[18-Jun-18 10:35 AM] themue#5527
Yes, or inside a runtime-reloadable configuration as a list of device-size tuples. [{"/mnt/drvX/arweave, 50, g}, {"/mnt/drvY/arweave", 100, g}]


[18-Jun-18 11:01 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yeah, that would be really nice


[18-Jun-18 11:03 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We were considering using file:eval/1 to do something similar for a while, but figured that JSON might be nicer in the end. The whole thing needs to be reconfigurable through a nice UI at some point, anyway.


[18-Jun-18 11:05 AM] themue#5527
In case of supporting other languages too JSON definitely is better, yes. Using it in many environments, e.g. also for APIs.


[18-Jun-18 11:06 AM] themue#5527
But no XML please, done too much with it during my Java time.  


[18-Jun-18 11:53 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Haha, indeed

No XML at any cost please. I am done with it's verbosity


[19-Jun-18 07:25 AM] arweave-india#5075
Haha no XML seems to be a consensus


[19-Jun-18 07:26 AM] themue#5527
Hehe, yes, absolutely.


[27-Jun-18 03:29 AM] tierralibre#2740
I am building an app that allows to load files directly on the chain. How does exactly the create transaction work? How can the users load their keys? Or open it on the client? I can build it, I just need to understand the process clearly. I read the api but is not clear to me.

[30-Jun-18 10:37 AM] Scalefinity#7851
@guys. I have talk seriously talk to a developer.
I'm mining ar since few days(mining address: qFzYCl02V2De6b0KVvBKThRI01Xw84r_XVZ1_0XXt98) and I have noticed that the blocks are full with ALL ar addresses. Seriously? That doesn't scale at all. I can easily spam the hole network with creating new low balance Addresses.
If nobody write me back, I will stress test the network the next few days.

The problem is, that you can't send big p2p block every 120sec.


[30-Jun-18 10:50 AM] Scalefinity#7851
That would be a great idea.
Maybe I'm wrong. But I will stress test the network and we will see.


[30-Jun-18 10:51 AM] Scalefinity#7851
like the Bcash stress test...


[30-Jun-18 10:52 AM] tierralibre#2740
already a quick improvement could be to compress the wallets part of the block. Is text it should compress a lot


[30-Jun-18 10:53 AM] tierralibre#2740
but again I dont know enough about the design


[30-Jun-18 10:53 AM] tierralibre#2740
is new to all I think


[30-Jun-18 10:54 AM] Scalefinity#7851
I also don't know why the developers don't publish the peer addresses.


[30-Jun-18 10:54 AM] tierralibre#2740
they are already public kind of, not explicitly communicated though.


[30-Jun-18 10:54 AM] Scalefinity#7851
I have some peers(just search a part of aws server, port 1984).


[30-Jun-18 10:54 AM] Scalefinity#7851
So I have some


[30-Jun-18 10:56 AM] Scalefinity#7851
see:
https://gist.github.com/bioharz/7592b10d6db71c7892d078e6b840f9b5


[30-Jun-18 11:49 AM] tierralibre#2740
there is an easier way to get the ips. The new wallet chrome extension gives you one ip when you archive and display a url. Then *:1984/peers gives the peers for that node.


[30-Jun-18 11:51 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Nice so I can finally start to mine?


[30-Jun-18 12:03 PM] Scalefinity#7851
yes, see:

That’s amazing. Thank you.

What’s the wallet Json format?


[30-Jun-18 12:27 PM] Scalefinity#7851
you have to generate a new wallet first


[30-Jun-18 12:28 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Makes sense. With the chrome add in?  Or can arweave-Server do it?


[30-Jun-18 12:28 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Sorry for dumb questions. There is limited documentation


[30-Jun-18 12:32 PM] Airman#0374
i guess u can use  Upvest wallet address


[30-Jun-18 12:38 PM] Scalefinity#7851
I don't think so.


[30-Jun-18 12:38 PM] Scalefinity#7851
please generate a own Address


[30-Jun-18 12:39 PM] Scalefinity#7851
without mine load_mining_key wallets/XXXXXX.json


[30-Jun-18 12:39 PM] Scalefinity#7851
after the mining process has started, close the miner


[30-Jun-18 12:39 PM] Scalefinity#7851
ls wallets/


[30-Jun-18 12:39 PM] Scalefinity#7851
you will see a new  wallet file


[30-Jun-18 12:39 PM] Scalefinity#7851
backup the file


[30-Jun-18 12:39 PM] Scalefinity#7851
XXXX.json


[30-Jun-18 12:39 PM] Scalefinity#7851
and start the miner with mine load_mining_key wallets/XXXXXX.json


[30-Jun-18 12:39 PM] Scalefinity#7851
easy


[30-Jun-18 12:41 PM] Airman#0374
ok, i will try. But now it is works with Upvest address. But i have no ESTABLISHED tcp sessions. Just TIME_WAIT


[30-Jun-18 12:41 PM] Airman#0374
and just for one address 209.97.175.74

anyway we should waiting for official addresses publication))) but it is nice for testing now with peers that you found:) Thank you!

You should only have to connect to a single peer to join the network.  You will automatically connect with additional peers as time goes on.

😨


[01-Jul-18 06:01 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hey bioharz,

One of our community admins just told me about your messages. The JSON storage of full block data is only temporary, don't worry. We will be moving to BSON or simiar for the local storage at some point. Regarding the wallet lists: As they are repeated across blocks they can be trivially compressed on the user's local machine. As miners in Arweave compete with thier ability to store data, finding the best compression algorithm is part of that competition. You would have read about this if you had waited for our mining email.

None of this data is actually transferred across the wire, of course. You can read about this in our lightpaper.


[01-Jul-18 06:01 AM] Scalefinity#7851
bitcoin blockchain is over 200GB. But since 2009^^
nobody is using ar and it's still over 11GB xD


[01-Jul-18 06:02 AM] Scalefinity#7851
@arweave-sam 
So, why you go live if you have such issues?


[01-Jul-18 06:02 AM] arweave-sam#9630
What issues?


[01-Jul-18 06:02 AM] Scalefinity#7851
You don't think this is a issue?


[01-Jul-18 06:03 AM] Scalefinity#7851
If I spam the network, that will be a issue...


[01-Jul-18 06:03 AM] wolfgang#3017
@arweave-sam if there is anything to implement then y ru deployed mining before optimization


[01-Jul-18 06:03 AM] Scalefinity#7851
I know, blockchain development is not easy. But if you can't develop a blockchain. Just don't start such a project...


[01-Jul-18 06:04 AM] wolfgang#3017
Yup spamming will jam the network


[01-Jul-18 06:04 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Creating new wallets costs AR, so you could try, but you will run out very quickly. This was mentioned in the first Archain paper.


[01-Jul-18 06:04 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Wallet lists are not transferred across the wire, either, so more wallets does not create more spam.


[01-Jul-18 06:06 AM] Scalefinity#7851
This is np for me since I'm a early investor.
If i create 10k addresses and send every address 0.000000001 AR?


[01-Jul-18 06:06 AM] wolfgang#3017
@arweave-sam ok understood with every wallet creation it costs ar token and it's written as transaction in block


[01-Jul-18 06:06 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Just to be clear: The wallet lists are necessary in the first place so that users can join the network at the last block, and start to mine with only that one block. They are then rewarded for each subsequent block they store. If you don't store all the blocks, you just don't take part in all of the hashing.


[01-Jul-18 06:06 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yes @wolfgang


[01-Jul-18 06:07 AM] wolfgang#3017
@Scalefinity i think it will cost ar token to create wallet address to prevent spamming of blockchain from addresses


[01-Jul-18 06:07 AM] Scalefinity#7851
Why I have all blocks stored with my mining operation?


[01-Jul-18 06:08 AM] Scalefinity#7851
Still, spamming would be easy. I have no problem to burn 1000AR tokens or more.


[01-Jul-18 06:08 AM] wolfgang#3017
@Scalefinity it should be from where u started mining


[01-Jul-18 06:08 AM] arweave-sam#9630
That is fine too


[01-Jul-18 06:08 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The users would just compress the wallet lists


[01-Jul-18 06:08 AM] Scalefinity#7851
And how?


[01-Jul-18 06:08 AM] Scalefinity#7851
What's about block verification and propagation?


[01-Jul-18 06:09 AM] Scalefinity#7851
The nodes will use a lot of CPU, RAM and bandwidth


[01-Jul-18 06:09 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Using any kind of mountable compression file system


[01-Jul-18 06:09 AM] Scalefinity#7851
the solution doesn't scale.


[01-Jul-18 06:09 AM] arweave-sam#9630
> What's about block verification and propagation?

Please read about block shadows in the lightpaper.


[01-Jul-18 06:09 AM] Scalefinity#7851
so tell, how I should compress my ext4 system?


[01-Jul-18 06:10 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Only around 2kb is transferred in order to come to consensus about the blcoks


[01-Jul-18 06:11 AM] wolfgang#3017
@arweave-sam can pls tell me y the current bc size is over 11gb?


[01-Jul-18 06:12 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Why would you compress your ext4 system? You mount a compressible filesystem in a subdirectory of your machine.


[01-Jul-18 06:13 AM] Scalefinity#7851
My node have used 1GB of Bandwidth. So I believe the point about block propagation, called "Blockshadows".


[01-Jul-18 06:13 AM] Scalefinity#7851
Can I delete the old blocks?


[01-Jul-18 06:13 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yes


[01-Jul-18 06:14 AM] arweave-sam#9630
As many as you like (bar the last 50)


[01-Jul-18 06:14 AM] arweave-sam#9630
But you will spend less time hashing

This is because you use old blocks as 'tickets' for entry into the hashing competition for new blocks.


[01-Jul-18 06:14 AM] Scalefinity#7851
Hmm, I understand.


[01-Jul-18 06:15 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The more old blocks you store, the more hashing you take part in


[01-Jul-18 06:15 AM] arweave-sam#9630
This is Proof of Access -- details in the lightpaper


[01-Jul-18 06:16 AM] Scalefinity#7851
thx.
And whats about the enc folder in block folder?
encrypted blocks?
these blocked contain stored files on ar, right?


[01-Jul-18 06:18 AM] arweave-sam#9630
No, that is actually so that if you don't have the recall block, you can download it from your peers ahead of the distribution of the next block shadow, so that you can very quickly come to consensus about the next block


[01-Jul-18 06:20 AM] arweave-sam#9630
So if p1 doesn't have rb, but p2 does, p1 can ask for enc(rb) from p2, then when p2 finds the next block they can just distribute the decryption key in the block shadow, and p1 already has everything they need to verify the block.


[01-Jul-18 06:21 AM] arweave-sam#9630
This gives p1 all the time between bn and bn+1 to download that recall block, so that they are ready to verify bn+1 with just the 'shadow' of the new block.

Hey - can one deploy a private Arweave netwok? If so, where can I find the node and genesis block configuration documentation? Thanks


[04-Jul-18 10:12 AM] arweave-india#5075
@mastreips Yes, it would indeed be possible for a private Arweave network to be deployed. At the moment we haven't published the documentation that you would like, but it's definitely something we are planning in the future.


[04-Jul-18 11:29 AM] mastreips#4693
THanks @arweave-india - is there an Arweave development roadmap I can reference, and a feature request/issue tracker?


[04-Jul-18 11:53 AM] arweave-india#5075
@mastreips We haven't got a dev roadmap published at the moment, but when we do I will pop it in the announcements channel here on Discord for you guys. Regarding feature requests/issue tracking at the moment we welcome you to drop us an email at team@arweave.org or me directly at india@arweave.org with as much information as possible, and we/I will make sure it gets logged for you and brought to the attention of Sam and the core dev team. We will be releasing a more formal & streamlined feature request and issue tracking process in the future too.

is there any rewards for miners right now?


[06-Jul-18 06:19 AM] arweave-india#5075
@nick cloudpost The inflation schedule (which grants block rewards) has not commenced yet, as we're currently in the soft onboarding period. Miners will receive the usual transaction fees. If you're not on the mining mailing list already or haven't received the first introductory email to said mailing list, please drop me an email at india@arweave.org when possible and I'll add you & forward the email, thanks


[15-Jul-18 02:29 PM] tadaams#6474
@arweave-india crosscompile for arm available?


[16-Jul-18 04:38 AM] digamma889#3785
Will there be a possibility to create multi signature wallets or similar solutions in the near future?
I'm asking this question as I'd like to add extra security to keeping mining rewards safe


[16-Jul-18 08:07 AM] Mike#2447
I would like to suggest that the auto create new wallet feature be replaced with a user prompt that asks to either generate new wallet, enter existing wallet address or use existing wallet file.  Is that possible?


[16-Jul-18 09:10 AM] arweave-india#5075
@tadaams I think Kyle addressed this question in another channel


[16-Jul-18 09:11 AM] arweave-india#5075
@digamma889 I'm not sure - haven't heard of any specific plans in this regard myself but I will raise it in our feature request discussions for you


[16-Jul-18 09:12 AM] arweave-india#5075
@Mike This is a neat idea, and a sensible suggestion. I'll add it into our feature request discussion within the team


[16-Jul-18 09:13 AM] arweave-india#5075
I suppose one risk could be that people put an inaccurate or non-existent address in that field, which would cause problems. Automatically creating a new wallet avoids that particular problem of course


[16-Jul-18 11:29 AM] digamma889#3785
@arweave-india thanks for bringing it up in the feature request


[16-Jul-18 04:25 PM] tadaams#6474

[27-Jul-18 05:29 PM] aurora#3501
what command do i run where i can see all blocks and transactions via the http api , i dont want to mine just want to runa node .


[27-Jul-18 05:32 PM] aurora#3501
./arweave-server ?


[29-Jul-18 02:10 AM] aurora#3501
hello?


[29-Jul-18 03:41 AM] codybartfast#9308
Hi  @aurora ,  to bring up the server I think you'll need to specify some peers. then it seems it will start to download blocks, but not mine.   In my experience the only blocks and transactions you can access via your local api are the locally stored ones.  So when you first start a node you might only have access to a handful of blocks and transactions.   Whenever I archive a page it returns a link to the same fixed IP address e.g. http://159.65.213.43:1984/tx/uoTzfoaN81h2_JyFkrvXTLFMnoSlWiuc9Yu1CmsFkH0/data.html.   That address should give you access to all the blocks and transactions.

I'm afraid I don't know what the intended solution is for finding the server with a given transaction - e.g.,  whether the server receiving the request starts looking for it from other server (Wildfire?) or if the client needs to hunt and peck through a bunch of peers until it finds one with it.


[29-Jul-18 04:00 AM] aurora#3501
yea same problem , running the server gives me access to only a handful of blocks , namely latest 50-100 blocks .


[29-Jul-18 04:40 AM] Aperçu#6470
Hello   Do you guys have any plan to open-source your chrome extension?


[29-Jul-18 02:50 PM] aurora#3501
the chromne extension doesnt validate address. it can send to any address


[01-Aug-18 11:46 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @codybartfast , which peers are you joining on? Nodes won't ask each other for transactions they don't know about as this is a potential attack vector, imagine if you just kept spamming random nodes with random transaction ids then you'd be able to generate huge amounts of traffic across the network very easily


[01-Aug-18 11:48 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @Aperçu, yes we will. We're working on a bunch of change at the moment so we'll push the code to Github when we've done that, this will probably be over the next few weeks


[01-Aug-18 11:50 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
@aurora Yes currently there's no validation on sender addresses. We'll add some validation in future and hopefully over the next few releases, the only validation that can easily be done is length/character checks to see if the address looks correct, or did you have some other specific case in mind?


[01-Aug-18 01:42 PM] tiamat#9131
I've tried this in #📝general, maybe here is more appropriate: :
I have four questions: 1) Is it normal to see splits? I often find the same block number with different hash across different nodes, yes they eventually sync. 2) Can I upload now 100 GB of data on the network if I pay the fees? How much can the network handle, how much did you put during tests? 3) Right now all blocks are around 50GB, once they reach 500+, are smaller miners(<100 GB space avail) still able to participate? 4) Is there a public testnet?


[02-Aug-18 02:11 AM] codybartfast#9308
Thanks  @arweave-kyle , I was not referring to nodes/mines asking for a random transaction.  I'm wondering how a user (or client app) is supposed to retrieve a _known_ transaction?   If tomorrow 159.65.213.43 were no longer available for whatever reason, how  should I access the documents I've put on the Weave?  My experience (and I think aurora's) is that today nodes only serve a transaction if it's stored locally.   I realise hunt and peck isn't great but my little brain shrinks even smaller trying to figure out how a node could 'recursively' query it's peers on a client's behalf without risking a firestorm.


[02-Aug-18 02:27 AM] codybartfast#9308
@tiamat  Non-authoritative answers from my experience and guesswork: 
1) Yes, I think splits/forks are common.  It seems to be why many peers have more blocks then the block height.
2) I'm not sure, but the limit might be around 2MB today, it looks like the server has a has an option MAX_BODY_SIZE set to 3MB (which would need to include other data and encoding).  If that’s right I expect that's to keep things manageable in the early days.
3) Yes the plan is certainly to allow folk to mine even if they don't store the entire block chain.
4) Not that I know of.  Would be nice to have one.


[04-Aug-18 10:42 AM] tiamat#9131
is there a way we could check the balance of a wallet  from the node?


[04-Aug-18 01:25 PM] themue#5527
You can do it via API, see https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/blob/master/http_iface_docs.md#get-wallet-balance-via-address


[05-Aug-18 07:03 AM] Mike#2447
http://127.0.0.1:1984/wallet/WALLETADDRESS/balance


[05-Aug-18 07:16 AM] tiamat#9131
yeah, I've figured it, thank you


[05-Aug-18 07:17 AM] tiamat#9131
how can I check if a block is valid? sometimes during forks it seems like more blocks are stored in ./blocks for the same block height


[07-Aug-18 11:36 AM] aurora#3501
is this node trusted? http://159.65.213.43:1984/ and run by the arweave team?


[07-Aug-18 12:21 PM] Mike#2447
That IP is not one of those provided by the Arweave team, although that's not to say it's untrustworthy.


[07-Aug-18 12:47 PM] codybartfast#9308
That's the address the chrome extension has provided for all the pages that I've archived.  So I've assumed(!) it's run by the team.


[07-Aug-18 01:24 PM] Mike#2447
My mistake!  I was referencing the list of peer IP addresses for mining purposes.  159.65.213.43 appears to be one of the main content serving IP addresses.


[07-Aug-18 01:25 PM] Mike#2447
It is also serving the content that I archived.


[07-Aug-18 02:58 PM] aurora#3501
so its by the arweave team?


[07-Aug-18 03:00 PM] Mike#2447
I can't say for certain, but my guess is it belongs to either Arweave or Upvest.


[09-Aug-18 07:02 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Yeah just to confirm 159.65.213.43 is an IP address controlled by the arweave team and it's used to serve the web extension. It's a load balancer which passes requests on to a bunch of arweave nodes.

@arweave-sam @arweave-kyle @arweave-india

Good question  @clome! I'd be down to check out the code too


[24-Sep-18 09:31 PM] patrick#8648
Further from that, we should create a library (similar to web3) to abstract all of the calls to the client (Murli language of course)


[24-Sep-18 09:31 PM] patrick#8648
Actually are there bounties for such libraries?


[25-Sep-18 05:10 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hi @clome, the block explorer is a project led by Viewblock, a third party company, so you would have to ask them for the source. I know that Upvest also run an internal block explorer that they might be willing to open source at some point.


[25-Sep-18 05:11 AM] arweave-sam#9630
> Actually are there bounties for such libraries?

We have been working on such libraries for our own applications (in JS, Erlang, PHP,


[25-Sep-18 05:12 AM] arweave-sam#9630
* etc.) and I Upvest has built a library for JVM based languages (Java, Scala, etc) and Python, too. But we are always welcome for more!

Which languages did you have in mind? We would be happy to setup a bounty.

[27-Oct-18 07:56 AM] Mike#2447
Is there a plan to group blocks into folders?  I feel like having tens of thousands of files in a single directly is getting a bit cumbersome.  When we get to hundreds of thousands it's going to be difficult to navigate.  Can the blocks get grouped into 10,000 file chunks?


[27-Oct-18 08:08 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Or by date or something? You are definitely right mike. Flat folder structure for blocks/txs/wallet lists is unsustainable


[28-Oct-18 07:49 AM] codybartfast#9308
Sounds like a good idea.   I was also wondering if the directories like blocks, txs and wallet_lists should also be grouped under a single folder.  E.g. "weave_data" as they seem to be related and are likely to be moved/copied together.


[28-Oct-18 08:21 AM] Mike#2447
Also a good idea.


[28-Oct-18 10:57 AM] Mike#2447
Another feature I'd like to see would be to duplicate the output of the Arweave server terminal with a command like "make log2".  That way if you want to ssh into the computer you can monitor both the regular "make log" and the server session.


[28-Oct-18 11:41 AM] tiamat#9131
for that you could use screen or simply redirect the server output to a log file


[29-Oct-18 06:15 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We normally use `screen` for that kind of setup @Mike , but we would like to support deamonising/non-deamonising the mining program at some point.

Regarding block directory structure: we are in a agreement. We expect to move to some kind of DBMS for basic block/tx handling at some point after N.2.0.0.


[29-Oct-18 10:21 AM] ATLAS#7218
Now the miner is running well, is there any plan to test TXs?


[29-Oct-18 10:22 AM] ATLAS#7218
Currently there is near 0 stress on the network but still there have been a lot of complaints about tx not going through


[29-Oct-18 10:22 AM] tiamat#9131
yeah, Telegram is full of those


[29-Oct-18 10:25 AM] Vilenarios#8742
TX load test would be fun  


[29-Oct-18 10:25 AM] ATLAS#7218
It should be tested and improved before we hit exchange imo.


[29-Oct-18 10:26 AM] ATLAS#7218
Otherwise, exchange listing would be not as fun as expected.


[31-Oct-18 08:32 AM] tiamat#9131

Hi @tiamat

Looking for a little bit of help, on the specs. What is the maximum payload size that can be put into a transaction?


[31-Oct-18 11:58 AM] beast#6522
@tiamat  are there any arch docs regarding persistence strategies  for large files


[31-Oct-18 11:59 AM] tiamat#9131
right now I guess the strategy for large files is to store in chunks and reassemble


[31-Oct-18 11:59 AM] tiamat#9131
Sam is here, so he will clarify  


[31-Oct-18 12:03 PM] arweave-sam#9630
There is technically a limit around 5mb right now, _but_ :

1. This is an implementation, not a protocol issue. We expect to be able to lift that limit.
2. There is an economic incentive for you not to store large chunks, but to break them up into smaller parts. Your second megabyte of storage (IIRC) will cost approximately 1.5-2x that of the first megabyte. We have attempted to construct an incentive here for the user to decide for themselves where/how to make the tradeoff, and to pay the network appropriately for the inconvenience. Smaller chunks take slightly longer to upload, are cheaper, and easier for the network to process, but larger/no chunking is easier for the client developer to build and upload is a bit faster.


[31-Oct-18 12:06 PM] tiamat#9131
considering the http protocol, paying more for large files sounds a good idea to me


[31-Oct-18 12:08 PM] beast#6522
yes and no, paying for the larger file also means that it is a single download stream for a browser,  so we cannot take advantage of the concurrent  request ability of the browsers, chrome for example can download 4 or 6 assets concurrently, this is why we break up our spa package if it increase  to multiple mb when minified into one file


[31-Oct-18 12:09 PM] beast#6522
im going to have to think about this one for a bit


[31-Oct-18 12:10 PM] beast#6522
@arweave-sam  thanks for the clarification.  do you have any docs besides the light paper and the http api docs?


[01-Nov-18 09:11 PM] patrick#8648
hey @arweave-sam  or @arweave-martin when it says this "The data to be signed is a concatentation of the raw (entirely unencoded) owner, target, id, data, quantity, reward and last_tx in that order."


[01-Nov-18 09:11 PM] patrick#8648
how the hell can one have an "id" for the transaction  signature if the id is based on the signature? 
`[id] A SHA2-256 hash of the signature, based 64 URL encoded.`


[01-Nov-18 09:12 PM] patrick#8648
in the php sdk it's a random number `$this->attributes['id'] = Helpers::base64urlEncode(base64_encode(random_bytes(32)));`


[01-Nov-18 09:13 PM] patrick#8648
which seems like an undersirable way to determine the id of the transaction


[01-Nov-18 10:50 PM] patrick#8648
im getting this when i send a transaction `tag_field_illegally_specified last_tx_not_valid`


[01-Nov-18 10:50 PM] patrick#8648
but my tx, afaik, is well formatted


[01-Nov-18 11:52 PM] patrick#8648
the tag field is simply `    "tags": [],`


[01-Nov-18 11:52 PM] patrick#8648
and the last transaction is now the last tx hash


[02-Nov-18 02:52 AM] tiamat#9131
no, id is not included in the concatenation that needs to be signed


[02-Nov-18 02:53 AM] tiamat#9131
the id is generated based on that signature


[02-Nov-18 02:57 AM] tiamat#9131
so you will not use a random number but the sha256 of the signed msg


[02-Nov-18 02:58 AM] tiamat#9131
not sure if it's clear what I say but I think Helpers::base64urlEncode(base64_encode(random_bytes(32)));  is used only for testing, you cannot generate a valid tx with that

Hey @patrick !


[05-Nov-18 08:15 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Looks like from the commit log that you got this working?


[05-Nov-18 08:15 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Thanks for your contribution to the project :D.


[05-Nov-18 08:16 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Please can you shoot me an address so I can send you some tokens by way of thanks?


[05-Nov-18 10:37 AM] patrick#8648
Yes finally got it working. With it I found some error handling bugs, i'll open a issue on it later today! Thanks Sam! Appreciate it, will send a DM

@onetoneband Looks healthy. If you check again in a few minutes you should see that the block height ("height") and the number of blocks on disk ("blocks") is increasing.


[13-Nov-18 05:20 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@onetoneband Are you saying you cannot access it on your external IP on port 1984?

yes, external address is 64.78.234.205

i log in by ssh, but it dones't pass through nat (

@onetoneband Have you enabled TCP port forwarding of port 1984 to the local IP address?


[13-Nov-18 05:40 AM] onetoneband#6330

@onetoneband Please post this question in the #🌟mining channel instead.


[13-Nov-18 08:09 AM] arweave-martin#1169
There are experienced miners there who can answer your question.


[18-Nov-18 03:13 AM] tiamat#9131
The AR wallets use SHA256, is this right? Any reason for not starting with something stronger, like at least 384? Quantum computers are around the corner, why didn't you chose to be more prepared than other blockchains?


[19-Nov-18 12:22 PM] Marcin#0065
Ar is sha2 384


[19-Nov-18 02:07 PM] tiamat#9131
I'm talking about the wallets


[19-Nov-18 02:08 PM] tiamat#9131
not the miner


[20-Nov-18 10:48 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@tiamat  The wallet address is a SHA256 hash of the public key. To exploit this you must both exploit the RSA key generation together with SHA256. That’s very unlikely to suddenly happen.

In the past, hashing algos haven’t just suddenly become compromised. Warnings have been issued when weaknesses have been found years before anyone managed to exploit them. If weaknesses are found in SHA256, then we can switch to another algo.

Btw, the reason for hashing the public key is to have more convenient (i.e. shorter) wallet addresses. Using SHA384 would result in a longer wallet address.

Another really cool btw: Arweave doesn’t rely on any elliptic curve cryptography ✌️ like e.g. Bitcoin and Ethereum do. That’s a very strong advantage. Or rather, that’s an achilles heel of Bitcoin, Ethereum and most other blockchains.


[20-Nov-18 10:55 AM] arweave-martin#1169
Here is a table where you can see you how long time it took for several hashing algos going from being considered strong until they got compromised. http://valerieaurora.org/hash.html


[20-Nov-18 11:01 AM] arweave-sam#9630
 


[20-Nov-18 02:12 PM] tiamat#9131
@arweave-martin But the RSA key is not stored on the weave, so it does not matter, attacker only needs something with the same hash.


[20-Nov-18 02:19 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yes, but the point is that if SHA-256 was broken, as well as finding a colliding hash the attacker would also need to find a valid RSA key pair that resulted in the collision. Changing any single bit of the RSA public key (which is used to produce the hash) would result in an invalid key pair, subsequently the search for a colliding hash is substantially more computationally complex.


[20-Nov-18 02:29 PM] tiamat#9131
ah, you are right, attacker would not only need a RSA key to match the hash, but also the pair


[21-Nov-18 07:51 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep -- would be tricky @tiamat 

The wallet list is also somewhat hash and length independent, so we should be able to easily support different algorithms, etc, in the future.


[26-Nov-18 03:27 AM] Marcin#0065
Hey guys, its not as important, but irritating a bit.
in the code i see here and there still "Archain" running around   for potential developers or investors it might be irritatiating seeing that. Maybe you find someone who want to sit down half a day and Crtl+F up all files to replace "Archain" with "Arweave"?#


[26-Nov-18 04:03 AM] arweave-lev#3466
Hi @Marcin , thankfully, it does not take a lot of time  to replace them,  `ag --files-with-matches Archain | xargs sed -i 's/Archain/Arweave/g'`  does the trick. Also, the  references are mostly in the comments and docs. https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/pull/90

Thanks for the idea, @Marcin , thanks for the implementation, @arweave-lev !

This is what we would like to build with ERM.  https://continuations.com/post/180584573645/on-chain-versus-off-chain-computation-turing

We want to store the data and the ability to verify both data and computation.


[30-Nov-18 01:27 AM] tierralibre#2740

[06-Dec-18 05:09 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@tierralibre Continuing from #📝general. Although, I think you would like to us the bulk upload feature  which we're working on right now, instead of `app_queue`.


[06-Dec-18 05:09 AM] tierralibre#2740
sure, but  this is a PoC


[06-Dec-18 05:10 AM] tierralibre#2740
This I have almost working


[06-Dec-18 05:10 AM] tierralibre#2740
I only have to pass the record and then it will work


[06-Dec-18 05:10 AM] tierralibre#2740
I then I can document the experiment


[06-Dec-18 05:10 AM] tierralibre#2740
until  there is a package I think it can be helpful. Plus is helping me understand how ar works  


[06-Dec-18 05:10 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@tierralibre which branch are you at?


[06-Dec-18 05:11 AM] tierralibre#2740
I am at master but not sure if I am on latest master


[06-Dec-18 05:11 AM] tierralibre#2740
I already tested the queue yesterday with erlang and it works


[06-Dec-18 05:11 AM] tierralibre#2740
so I need a function that gives me a record


[06-Dec-18 05:11 AM] tierralibre#2740
 


[06-Dec-18 05:12 AM] tierralibre#2740
by passing some data to it


[06-Dec-18 05:13 AM] tierralibre#2740
ar_tx


[06-Dec-18 05:14 AM] tierralibre#2740
has new


[06-Dec-18 05:14 AM] tierralibre#2740
#tx { tags = [{"Content-Type", "image/jpeg"}], data = FileBinary }).


[06-Dec-18 05:14 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@tierralibre how many transactions did you have in the queue? The thing is, starting from the second tx it is gonna take around 4 hours until it is included into the block.


[06-Dec-18 05:15 AM] tierralibre#2740
is there a way to just create it without the queue


[06-Dec-18 05:15 AM] tierralibre#2740
I have the  wallet


[06-Dec-18 05:15 AM] tierralibre#2740
I have the data


[06-Dec-18 05:15 AM] tierralibre#2740
I can call anything in ar


[06-Dec-18 05:15 AM] tierralibre#2740
actually the queue example should have that


[06-Dec-18 05:17 AM] tierralibre#2740
and I could just send a message to the pid as well


[06-Dec-18 05:17 AM] tierralibre#2740
{add_tx, TX}


[06-Dec-18 05:17 AM] tierralibre#2740
the queue would be easier though


[06-Dec-18 05:17 AM] tierralibre#2740
so one step at a time


[06-Dec-18 05:17 AM] arweave-lev#3466
Yes, you need to sign it like here - https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/blob/master/src/apps/app_queue.erl#L63. And then add it to the pool - https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/blob/master/src/apps/app_queue.erl#L72. You can replace `S#state.node` with `whereis(http_entrypoint_node)`

[06-Dec-18 05:18 AM] tierralibre#2740
so with this queue how do I create a tx record with a function and pass it to it


[06-Dec-18 05:18 AM] tierralibre#2740
actually It would be easier to do a elixir app that starts arweave


[06-Dec-18 05:18 AM] tierralibre#2740
Bs = ar_weave:init([{ar_wallet:to_address(Pub1), ?AR(10000), <<>>}]),


[06-Dec-18 05:18 AM] tierralibre#2740
but that later


[06-Dec-18 05:19 AM] tierralibre#2740
add(Queue, ar_tx:new(Addr, ?AR(1), ?AR(1000), <<>>)),


[06-Dec-18 05:20 AM] tierralibre#2740
```{User, name, twitter}  %User{name: name, twitter: twitter}```


[06-Dec-18 05:20 AM] tierralibre#2740
left is erlang right elixir


[06-Dec-18 05:21 AM] tierralibre#2740
so  #tx { tags = [{"Content-Type", "image/jpeg"}], data = FileBinary }


[06-Dec-18 05:21 AM] arweave-lev#3466
Call `rr(ar).` to make the record available in the REPL. Then assuming you started a queue  - `app_queue:add(Queue, #tx { tags = [{"Content-Type", "image/jpeg"}], data = FileBinary})`. There is a usage example here - https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/blob/master/src/apps/app_internet_archive.erl

[06-Dec-18 05:21 AM] tierralibre#2740
all that part I have


[06-Dec-18 05:22 AM] tierralibre#2740
working


[06-Dec-18 05:22 AM] tierralibre#2740
what I am trying to work is how do I call this from the elixir node with rpc


[06-Dec-18 05:22 AM] tierralibre#2740
queue = :rpc.call(:"node@name", :app_queue, :start, [wallet])


[06-Dec-18 05:23 AM] tierralibre#2740
and now is the next step


[06-Dec-18 05:23 AM] tierralibre#2740
app_queue:add(Queue, #tx { tags = [{"Content-Type", "image/jpeg"}], data = FileBinary }).


[06-Dec-18 05:23 AM] tierralibre#2740
so the question I have is how to I make this record in elixir


[06-Dec-18 05:23 AM] tierralibre#2740
if there is a function that makes the record for me that would be  the easiest


[06-Dec-18 05:23 AM] tierralibre#2740
by just passing the list of tags and the data


[06-Dec-18 05:25 AM] tierralibre#2740
I see there is a module to define records in elixir too


[06-Dec-18 05:25 AM] tierralibre#2740
Records are simply tuples where the first element is an atom:


[06-Dec-18 05:25 AM] tierralibre#2740
{:#tx %{ tags = [{"Content-Type", "image/jpeg"}], data = FileBinary }}


[06-Dec-18 05:26 AM] arweave-lev#3466
Can you try Record? https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/blob/master/lib/elixir/lib/record.ex#L31

[06-Dec-18 05:26 AM] tierralibre#2740
yes that is the module I was talking about

{Reactions}
  

[06-Dec-18 05:31 AM] tierralibre#2740
But then I guess I have to define the tx record


[06-Dec-18 05:32 AM] tierralibre#2740
there is this module


[06-Dec-18 05:32 AM] tierralibre#2740
Record.extract(:file_info, from_lib: "kernel/include/file.hrl")
[size: :undefined, type: :undefined, access: :undefined, atime: :undefined,
 mtime: :undefined, ctime: :undefined, mode: :undefined, links: :undefined,
 major_device: :undefined, minor_device: :undefined, inode: :undefined,
 uid: :undefined, gid: :undefined]


[06-Dec-18 05:32 AM] tierralibre#2740
what would the hrl file be for this?


[06-Dec-18 05:33 AM] arweave-lev#3466
I think, Elixir is capable of loading the Erlang definition. You should then be able to use the "tx" name to create record.


[06-Dec-18 05:34 AM] tierralibre#2740
This module is definitely for this


[06-Dec-18 05:34 AM] tierralibre#2740
```In Elixir, records are used mostly in two situations:

to work with short, internal data
to interface with Erlang records```


[06-Dec-18 05:35 AM] tierralibre#2740
which erlang file contains the #tx record information?


[06-Dec-18 05:35 AM] tierralibre#2740
I guess this is like the rr() in erlang


[06-Dec-18 05:35 AM] tierralibre#2740
rr("src/*")


[06-Dec-18 05:36 AM] arweave-lev#3466
ar.hrl defines the tx record


[06-Dec-18 05:36 AM] tierralibre#2740
thank you!


[06-Dec-18 05:41 AM] arweave-lev#3466

but now that I know how to create records I think I can actually make a utility tool for this


[06-Dec-18 08:13 AM] tierralibre#2740
I have updated the readme with instructions on how to create a transaction from elixir.

Is it possible to use Arweave chrome extension like the way metmask doing for eth? Signing transactions on ar enabled sites.


[08-Dec-18 05:52 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Hey @woombash, you can indeed install our web extension via Google Chrome, the same way you would with MetaMask. Once you have installed the extension, you have the option to create a new wallet or load an existing Arweave/Upvest wallet into there - It's currently only compatible with AR tokens. Once you're up and running, you can use the extension to archive web pages and send tokens between Arweave wallets. Here's a quick guide on how to get set up - https://medium.com/@arweave/introducing-the-arweave-web-extension-2-0-dd706d1c9523

@arweave-sophie  I have tried that use cases. I was asking about can I use chrome extension for signing transactions to upload files if I'm building an app.


[08-Dec-18 06:29 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Currently, you can only archive web pages with the web extension tool. However, we are looking to work on a tool that enables upload of different file types. I'll let you know as soon as we have any update on this  


[08-Dec-18 06:37 AM] woombash#1763
Thank you @arweave-sophie

No worries @woombash  


[11-Dec-18 02:32 PM] tierralibre#2740
what is the BHL in the source code?


[11-Dec-18 02:42 PM] arweave-india#5075
That's the block hash list  @tierralibre


[11-Dec-18 02:45 PM] tierralibre#2740
Thank you!


[11-Dec-18 02:49 PM] tierralibre#2740
as well the sync process for blocks I assume before writing any block it checks the local DB right? So it will never write a block that is already on the local db


[12-Dec-18 01:19 AM] tierralibre#2740
I am seeing blocks with the same height in my blocks folder repeated.


[12-Dec-18 01:19 AM] tierralibre#2740
Is this correct?


[12-Dec-18 01:19 AM] tierralibre#2740

[12-Dec-18 01:20 AM] tierralibre#2740
Should not be only one block per height?


[12-Dec-18 01:56 AM] ATLAS#7218
One block is *fake*


[12-Dec-18 01:57 AM] tierralibre#2740
so how can I clean fake blocks?


[12-Dec-18 01:57 AM] tierralibre#2740
there seems to be a lot of fake blocks on my blocks, this is just an example


[12-Dec-18 01:59 AM] tierralibre#2740
as well I see that there are a lot more blocks on the peer network that the current height


[12-Dec-18 02:00 AM] tierralibre#2740
when getting blocks on an initial sync, should not I get just the valid ones?


[12-Dec-18 04:23 AM] tiamat#9131
I don't think they are fake, more likely they are valid but not accepted by the network because someone else was faster or had better WF score.


[12-Dec-18 04:24 AM] tiamat#9131
There is an ar_cleanup:remove_invalid_blocks() but I'm not sure what's the latest syntax, I have used it months ago, maybe someone will tell you exactly how to use it in the latest version.


[12-Dec-18 04:25 AM] arweave-sam#9630
`ar_cleanup:remove_invalid_blocks().`<ENTER>


[12-Dec-18 04:25 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Is what you want


[12-Dec-18 04:26 AM] arweave-sam#9630
But make sure to run it on a node that has already joined the net successfully  


[12-Dec-18 05:01 AM] tierralibre#2740
thank you!


[12-Dec-18 06:09 AM] chriscord#4741
Is it necessary to run ‘ar_cleanup’? Or can we  just leave the duplicate blocks as they are?


[12-Dec-18 06:17 AM] Vilenarios#8742
The ar cleanup doesn’t seem to do anything for me. Still have 2k more blocks than the block height.


[12-Dec-18 06:59 AM] arweave-martin#1169
You should also restart the miner after `ar_cleanup:remove_invalid_blocks().` finishes.


[12-Dec-18 07:01 AM] arweave-lev#3466
It is fine to keep those blocks - they just take up extra space.


[12-Dec-18 09:24 AM] Vilenarios#8742
What happens if someone decides to maliciously upload tons of garbage to the weave? Can we just filter that out or something?


[12-Dec-18 09:34 AM] arweave-sam#9630
To us, data is data


[12-Dec-18 09:34 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The user pays to upload it, you guys get paid to store it


[12-Dec-18 09:35 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You can of course choose not to store it personally, if you like  


[12-Dec-18 09:45 AM] Vilenarios#8742
How do I do that?


[17-Dec-18 07:00 PM] chriscord#4741
Not sure if this or something similar is planned. Can you wrap the arweave api as an elixir library? And build an example elixir phoenix app that uploads data to arweave?


[19-Dec-18 04:45 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Hey @chriscord, i'll ask our developers and get back to you :blockchain:


[22-Dec-18 02:33 PM] tierralibre#2740
@chriscord  I did a proof concept on connecting an elixir app via nodes


[22-Dec-18 02:34 PM] tierralibre#2740
is documented. And I am building a phoenix app in the next weeks to upload our Open Data.

https://github.com/tierralibre/arlix


[22-Dec-18 02:35 PM] tierralibre#2740
This is more of a hack, there are better ways but until is packaged, we can use the super powers of the beam and nodes.


[22-Dec-18 02:35 PM] tierralibre#2740
I just got busy with applying for a competition just finished the paperwork yesterday. now going back to open data.


[23-Dec-18 04:12 AM] chriscord#4741
@tierralibre thanks, that’s great! I’ll take a look/stab at it later to see what I can come up with


[06-Jan-19 09:25 AM] tierralibre#2740
Hello all! I have been reading. Mix is actually very good to compile erlang. http://featurebranch.com/using-mix-to-compile-your-erlang-projects/


[06-Jan-19 09:25 AM] tierralibre#2740
And if we do that we can embed arweave in any elixir project and call it directly.


[06-Jan-19 09:26 AM] tierralibre#2740
I am working on doing that . Reading about it. Thoughts?


[06-Jan-19 09:28 AM] tierralibre#2740
It would for example allow to create easy web apps with Phoenix that can use arweave as the data storage


[06-Jan-19 09:42 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@tierralibre Mix is using rebar3 for building, and rebar3 can build any Erlang app. Unfortunately, arweave is not an Erlang app but has a custom build system and other non standard things. Ergo, it's not registered as a running application in the VM.

Sooner or later we will have made arweave into an Erlang app and then you can add its git URL as a dependency to your mix project.


[06-Jan-19 09:43 AM] arweave-martin#1169
How is running in distribution mode going for you?


[06-Jan-19 09:43 AM] tierralibre#2740
You can run custom tasks with mix.task


[06-Jan-19 09:43 AM] tierralibre#2740
The distribution mode  makes it really complex


[06-Jan-19 09:45 AM] arweave-martin#1169
Can you also add custom paths to beam files with mix? Or maybe you just do it in the startup script.


[06-Jan-19 09:48 AM] arweave-martin#1169
One idea for shortcut for making arweave an Erlang app is to create a bare-bone Erlang app called `arweave` which only do one thing and that's calling `ar:start/0` on startup. You don't even need to build the regular code with mix as long as you manually make sure to run the regular `make build` before starting your mix app.


[06-Jan-19 09:50 AM] tierralibre#2740
that is exactly what I want to do with mix


[06-Jan-19 09:50 AM] tierralibre#2740
I created an app arweave that will call ar:start/0 supervised


[06-Jan-19 09:51 AM] tierralibre#2740
now I am trying to understand how to get arweave to call it


[06-Jan-19 09:51 AM] tierralibre#2740
I see mix can do  a lot. It can be use to  do custom compile too


[06-Jan-19 09:52 AM] tierralibre#2740
Can you help making that?


[06-Jan-19 09:52 AM] tierralibre#2740
"You don't even need to build the regular code with mix as long as you manually make sure to run the regular make build before starting your mix app."


[06-Jan-19 09:56 AM] arweave-martin#1169
Basically, if you run `make build` you will have all the compiled beam files in these 4 directories:
./ebin
./lib/prometheus/_build/default/lib/prometheus/ebin
./lib/accept/_build/default/lib/accept/ebin
./lib/prometheus_process_collector/_build/default/lib/prometheus_process_collector/ebin

If you just can add those directories to you path of the VM, then all modules will be available for use. See the `arweave-server` script to see how the paths are set (with the `-pa` argument)


[06-Jan-19 09:56 AM] tierralibre#2740
yes the last 3 use mix for their build


[06-Jan-19 09:57 AM] tierralibre#2740
you can pass Erlang paths for sure to  elixir and mix


[06-Jan-19 09:59 AM] arweave-martin#1169
There are more deps under ./lib but those ebin directories are not added to the path. I don't understand how that works.


[06-Jan-19 09:59 AM] tierralibre#2740
there is even a mix task to compile


[06-Jan-19 09:59 AM] tierralibre#2740
https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.Tasks.Compile.Erlang.html


[06-Jan-19 09:59 AM] tierralibre#2740
I just don't know enough about erlang


[06-Jan-19 10:03 AM] arweave-martin#1169
You could also create a mix task that runs `make build` and then copies all beam files to wherever you would like to have them. Might be more convinient.


[06-Jan-19 10:04 AM] arweave-martin#1169
I don't remember if mix still have support for "raw" dependencies. That's dependencies it will only download but not try to build. That could be useful.


[06-Jan-19 10:09 AM] tierralibre#2740
I am reading I still don't fully get it.  If doing a release version then yes everything goes into a folder that is erlang like. but for dev i am not sure how it works yet


[06-Jan-19 10:10 AM] tierralibre#2740
I see under _build/dev/lib


[06-Jan-19 10:10 AM] tierralibre#2740
there is an ebin


[06-Jan-19 10:11 AM] tierralibre#2740
per app


[06-Jan-19 10:12 AM] tierralibre#2740
but there there is a mix rebar config


[06-Jan-19 10:12 AM] tierralibre#2740
```{deps,[{cowlib,".*",{git,"https://github.com/ninenines/cowlib","2.7.0"}},
       {ranch,".*",{git,"https://github.com/ninenines/ranch","1.7.1"}}]}.
{erl_opts,[debug_info,warn_export_vars,warn_shadow_vars,warn_obsolete_guard,
           warn_missing_spec,warn_untyped_record]}.
{overrides,[]}.```


[06-Jan-19 10:12 AM] tierralibre#2740
which is just a list of deps no?


[06-Jan-19 10:13 AM] tierralibre#2740
{ranch,".*",


[06-Jan-19 10:13 AM] tierralibre#2740
which I guess it says on from  the ranch.beam / ranch.beam *


[06-Jan-19 10:14 AM] tierralibre#2740
and then it passes some erl_opts


[06-Jan-19 10:15 AM] tierralibre#2740
and the ranch mix.rebar.config is {overrides,[]}.


[06-Jan-19 10:16 AM] tierralibre#2740
how would you describe the arweave.app ?


[06-Jan-19 10:16 AM] tierralibre#2740
so for example when creating an empty mix arweave this is what gets compiled


[06-Jan-19 10:16 AM] tierralibre#2740
```application,arweave,
             [{applications,[kernel,stdlib,elixir,logger]},
              {description,"arweave"},
              {modules,['Elixir.Arweave']},
              {registered,[]},
              {vsn,"0.1.0"}]}.```


[06-Jan-19 10:21 AM] tierralibre#2740
The correct way would be to use mix


[06-Jan-19 10:21 AM] tierralibre#2740
looking at the emakefile


[06-Jan-19 10:21 AM] tierralibre#2740
```{'src/*', [debug_info,
           {i, "src"},
           {i, "lib/elli/include/"},

           {outdir, "ebin"}]}.

Can this not be converted to mix?


[06-Jan-19 10:29 AM] tierralibre#2740
```mix compile.erlang View Source
Compiles Erlang source files.

When this task runs, it will first check the modification times of all files to be compiled and if they haven't been changed since the last compilation, it will not compile them. If any of them have changed, it compiles everything.

For this reason, the task touches your :compile_path directory and sets the modification time to the current time and date at the end of each compilation. You can force compilation regardless of modification times by passing the --force option.

 Command line options
--force - forces compilation regardless of modification times

--all-warnings - prints warnings even from files that do not need to be recompiled

 Configuration
ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS - can be used to give default compile options. The value must be a valid Erlang term. If the value is a list, it will be used as is. If it is not a list, it will be put into a list.

:erlc_paths - directories to find source files. Defaults to ["src"].

:erlc_include_path - directory for adding include files. Defaults to "include".

:erlc_options - compilation options that apply to Erlang's compiler. Defaults to [:debug_info].

For a complete list of options, see :compile.file/2.

For example, to configure the erlc_options for your Erlang project you may run:

erlc_options: [:debug_info, {:i, 'path/to/include'}]```


[06-Jan-19 10:29 AM] tierralibre#2740
is the same erlc_options:  as the emake file


[06-Jan-19 10:30 AM] tierralibre#2740

@team I have seen the article where you want to move to ProgWork. Why not some hybrid PoS where you still need recall blocks? That would make the network much safer. PoW is not the best with smaller networks as we have seen recently with ETC.

Thanks for your suggestion @tiamat, i'll feedback to the team. As far as I know we won't be implementing PoS anytime soon, but i'll let you know if anything changes :blockchain:

Hi,  I am running a 72 core node which averages 90% CPU usage - All cores are used but i can see some cores around 50% or less. I have tried giving  `max_miner 72` and without the argument.  Result has been the same. How do I use CPU more efficiently. I dont face this issue with 36 core ones though!

How many Trac do you get for a block ?

Trac? What is it?


[13-Jan-19 01:18 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Approx 34,5 AR per block


[13-Jan-19 01:55 AM] ivhturp#3325
@slayer_hellraiser this server has a clock speed of 2.1Ghz. I feel cpu with more clock speed and less cores has a better chance of finding a block compared to low clock speed and high number of cores.  8 core CPU of 3.1 Ghz was getting more blocks than this 32 core one of 2.1 Ghz!


[13-Jan-19 02:02 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@ivhturp I think that the probability of receiving a block does not depend on the number of cores, only on the processor clock frequency


[13-Jan-19 02:02 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Maybe the developers will tell us?


[13-Jan-19 05:25 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Definitely depends on clock speed and not core count.


[13-Jan-19 05:25 AM] Vilenarios#8742
That’s why I decided against getting some older Gear with high core Xeons.


[13-Jan-19 05:34 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Hey @ivhturp, can I ask if your setup has threading?


[13-Jan-19 11:20 AM] ivhturp#3325
Hi @arweave-sophie , yes it does


[13-Jan-19 11:22 AM] ivhturp#3325
@slayer_hellraiser @Vilenarios I understand the advantage of clock speed. But isnt it too much difference when we compare 8 core 3.1 Ghz vs 32 Ghz 2.1 Ghz.


[13-Jan-19 11:42 AM] Vilenarios#8742
But I don’t think arweave combines all the cores into 1 hashrate


[13-Jan-19 11:42 AM] Vilenarios#8742
It operates as more of a multi threaded process


[13-Jan-19 11:43 AM] Vilenarios#8742
One a new block gets mined and 100 cores begin mining it, which core you think will find it the fastest? The one with 3.1ghz or the 2.6ghz?


[13-Jan-19 11:44 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Like I’m trying to win a team foot race with you and I’ll put in my one fastest runner


[13-Jan-19 11:45 AM] Vilenarios#8742
But you put in 10 slower runners.


[13-Jan-19 11:45 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Who is gonna win?


[13-Jan-19 11:46 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Sure my one fast guy may slip and fall and one of ur slow guys may overtake them. But more often than not the fastest will come in first. And we are in a race where there is no second or third place.


[13-Jan-19 11:47 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Idk that’s the best analogy I could come up with and it seems to make sense.


[13-Jan-19 12:04 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
I think the same


[13-Jan-19 12:05 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
But can anyone tell us about this from any of the developers? It is not so obvious from white paper.


[13-Jan-19 12:18 PM] tiamat#9131
I think it's all about hashrate. Like 10 slow racers could compete with one fast racer as long as their hashrate sums the faster's rate. But in reality with different network speeds and different WF, results could be different.


[13-Jan-19 10:19 PM] ivhturp#3325
@Vilenarios Your analogy is sound. But it doesnt mean that, if I have a single core of 10 Ghz clock speed(just for analogy) it will mine all the blocks.
AFAIK, in POW, a miner starts with block data, timestamp and a random nonce to mine the block. This random nonce and timestamp will be different for each miner and hence, some miners find it faster than others even if they mine on same CPU. In Arweave, I believe process will be similar. @devs can you please clarify on this?


[14-Jan-19 04:00 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
That's true @ivhturp :blockchain:


[14-Jan-19 07:11 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Well if it works the way you suggest @ivhturp then you would be getting a bit more no? Do you have a bad network or are you using polling?


[14-Jan-19 07:13 AM] Vilenarios#8742

Hey @arweave-sam care to help clarify here how the hashing works?  Does it combine all CPU cores or use them individually?

We spawn a mining 'supervisor', then one 'mining worker' per detected thread or the max miners value @Vilenarios

@Vilenarios could you clarify what you mean by "work together"?

@Vilenarios in any case, yes - workers are looking for the right hash independently.

@Vilenarios thats exactly why I am confused   I have a 50Mbps connection(not a dedicated one) and dedicated IP - no polling . Let me run again and check if there is issue with setup!


[14-Jan-19 02:57 PM] chriscord#4741
@arweave-lev so with multiple threads, you don't have increased processing power just increased probability that one of your threads will find the right hash?


[15-Jan-19 02:24 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@chriscord  what matters is the number of CPU cores you have, since it determines the number of simultaneous instructions possible. OS threads do not by themselves speed up computation, be it hashing or something else.


[15-Jan-19 02:37 AM] tiamat#9131
miners will use hyperthreads(vcpus)


[15-Jan-19 02:43 AM] arweave-lev#3466
Yes, hyperthreads count, cause they can execute arithmetic instructions at the same time.

or you guys manage that subset yourselves?

Yes so currently it's a bunch of nodes managed by the project, we're looking at various mechanisms for gateways to make  access as simple as possible.

http://arweave.net/QE7MPcwU3wgrT91gGU05TYzqVxFUshCHFUH5a-5Su5M  so this lists out those nodes i assume


[30-Jan-19 10:46 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
You can set something similar up really easily, the nodes act as webservers so you could point a domain to a node and use that domain as a gateway

@Vilenarios centralized in the same way as Ethereum and Infura, at this point you are either a geek and use your own gateway or use a service which is centralized

Yep, makes sense. It would be even better if there were a couple of community gateways out there

[08-Feb-19 08:07 PM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
i flipped trought the arweave example apps in the github src and i wonder e.g. with the microblogging app which stores all chirps in a new list how this is implemented internally. the transaction comes in which is already stored on the chain, then the content gets copied to the memory of the server. is the content copied or just pointers? that server exposes a api and makes itself available to clients. after a restart of the server, would the internal db be still available or would it have to be rebuild from the transactions? if a second server wants to implement an alternate endpoint, would each transaction be replayed on startup automatically?


[08-Feb-19 08:15 PM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
this architecture really limits the application to the resources of one server. if you wanna build twitter you can only store as many tweets as you can fit on your server. would it be doable to only index the metadata in a local db and pull the contents directly from the weave? can every node deliver every transaction content aka is there a routing to resolve pieces that are not in the local block store?


[11-Feb-19 03:43 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
From a web page that is served from the weave, you would now use ArQL to query the chirps @Goldberg | StakeSquid


[11-Feb-19 04:28 AM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
@arweave-sophie I can't find anything about ArQL, ... do you have a link?


[11-Feb-19 04:36 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @Goldberg | StakeSquid we're working on docs for these features but the tl;dr version is you can send a HTTP POST request to the `/arql` endpoint on a node and it'll give you transactions that match a given tag


[11-Feb-19 04:37 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
For example:

`POST arweave.net/arql`
```json
{
    "op": "equals", 
    "expr1": "User-Agent",
    "expr2": "ArweaveChrome/2.0.3"
}
```
That will find txs that have the value `ArweaveChrome/2.0.3` on their `User-Agent` tag


[11-Feb-19 04:39 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Expressions can be nested and you can apply boolean logic, so for example if i wanted to find transactions from `ArweaveChrome/2.0.2` or `ArweaveChrome/2.0.3` I could do this

`POST arweave.net/arql`
```json
{
    "op": "or",
    "expr1": {
        "op": "equals",
        "expr1": "User-Agent",
        "expr2": "ArweaveChrome/2.0.3"
    },
    "expr2": {
        "op": "equals",
        "expr1": "User-Agent",
        "expr2": "ArweaveChrome/2.0.2"
    }
}
```


[11-Feb-19 04:40 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
You could nest expressions further and mix ands/ors to run some interesting queries and find matching txs

You can see the tags for transactions in the transaction JSON, viewblock block explorer will also show you the decoded values (they're base64 encoded)


[11-Feb-19 05:00 AM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
@arweave-kyle interesting thank you. quite easy to understand.


[11-Feb-19 05:01 AM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
so each node indexes all the data in the weave not only the blocks that are in the local blockstore


[11-Feb-19 05:01 AM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
and makes the index available to query using arql, right?


[11-Feb-19 05:05 AM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
in case of a twitter you would want to have fulltext search and hashtags to generate lists on the fly and get the latest tweets from a list of bookmarked users. hashtags could be translated to tags with a boolean value. transactions originating from addresses would have to be queried one by one right?


[11-Feb-19 05:06 AM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
fulltext search is not currently available i assume.


[11-Feb-19 05:36 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
So  the search wouldn't apply the the contents of the actual data, arql is limited to the tags


[11-Feb-19 05:38 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
I think some client logic would be needed when posting tweets in the twitter example, the client posting the tweets could extract the hashtagsand put them in the transaction tags. You can have multiple tags with the same key, so you could have say 5 hashag tags and that would work fine


[11-Feb-19 06:41 AM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
it sounds like the tags are part of the metadata that is available locally in the blockstore of every node and the content gets "sharded" and therefore is only available by retrieving trough the network.


[12-Feb-19 05:00 AM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
@arweave-kyle ?


[12-Feb-19 05:29 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @Goldberg | StakeSquid , so currently the tags are part of the transaction itself, and if a node doesn't have the transaction it doesn't have the tags. We want to encourage as many replications of the data to exist so at the moment we don't split/shard/propagate tags separately from their txs


[13-Feb-19 04:08 AM] Goldberg | StakeSquid#5271
@arweave-kyle ah ok, so I have do download the whole weave to query past transactions filtered by tags... and new transactions get propagated to and downloaded by each and every node in the network, correct? So by writing a handler in erlang I should be able to notify a external process of every update which then can use that information to build indexes or do other stuff?


[13-Feb-19 08:20 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @Goldberg | StakeSquid, no you don't have to download the full weave to query. The node will simply just respond with any matching transactions that it knows about at that point in time

[03-Apr-19 08:20 AM] christopher#3717
Few questions based that were not entirely clear from reading the whitepaper.


[03-Apr-19 08:20 AM] christopher#3717
1. Arweave seems to incentivize max redundancy through randomly selecting recall blocks. 
Wouldn’t that mean that it is in a miners interest to simply store everything they can and purchase harddisks? Other decentralized storage systems all use a sharding approach, where number of replicas can be controlled.
How does the project solve the most basic problem that all nodes need to store all information?


[03-Apr-19 08:21 AM] christopher#3717
2. How do you ensure, that recall blocks never get lost and that replication for all blocks is somewhat equal in the network? There is no explicit mechanism for this as far as I see. How likely is it, that a block could get lost with standard miner behaviour (which is likely storing random blocks)? Shouldn’t there be a more advanced mechanism to guarantee true permanence that considers the number of replica?


[03-Apr-19 09:06 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hey @christopher 

1: Arweave is a proof of work network which creates a competition for storage capacity, as well as hashing power. It does indeed create a situation in which miners are incentivised to make copies of as many recall blocks as they can store -- this is by design -- although it does not _require_ them to store all of the data. Fundamentally this is an incentive based approach rather than a contractual approach. This maximises redundant copies for the storers in the network, lowering the probability of data loss (see below), as well as decreasing the latency for finding data (more redundant copies means that a user is more likely to find the data faster).
2: I actually have a draft blog post on this that I have been meaning to post for a while. It goes into all of the statistics regarding block availability as well as a comparison with redundancy-limited contractual approaches to decentralised storage.

3. Wildfire is supposed to incentivize data provisioning to interested parties. However, these seem to only ever be miners. Wasn’t the purpose to serve data through a REST-API to anyone? This would not be part of the record.
4. Blockshadowing makes sense, but only works for miners, who do collect TX information before a block is mined. Furthermore, recall blocks can not be expected to be widely available and will always have to be sent. Is there any approach to address this?
5. Blacklist is a simple local file filter. Little protection and a lot of responsibility for the user. How are these blacklists shared?
6. There seems to be a tradeoff between storing recall blocks and being fast in calculating PoW. How is difficulty adjusted? How do you address ASICs?

6. I think they should be like a milestones, when ASICs jump in, it means the project is well known, important and well incentivized

Professional questions here guys. Looking forward to the answers.


[03-Apr-19 11:04 AM] arweave-sam#9630
3: WF does indeed work between miners (who communicate amongst themselves through the RESTful API you mention), or things that _look_ like miners. This means that you can always be sure to get your data from other nodes if you run a local node on your machine (by comparison, running local node software is always required to get your data from the network in Filecoin, Sia etc). But you can also get your data from nodes that cannot distinguish you from other nodes (by User-Agent header spoofing, etc), or simply from altruistic nodes that do not care (similarly to the distribution of old blocks in Bitcoin, ETH, and over-seeding in Bittorrent). Attempting to disguise browsers as nodes will inevitably lead to a cat and mouse game, so while functional, we are looking at various mechanisms of incentivising gateways to share traffic with non-participating 'visitor' users.
4. Miners only store transactions that they can mine into blocks. This makes them potentially valuable to the node in question. Optionally, nodes can choose to serve data from transactions that are pending but by default this is not enabled. After the `fast-write` network upgrade recall block distribution won't be required at all (succinct proofs of access will instead be distributed with the block shadow itself).


[03-Apr-19 11:04 AM] arweave-sam#9630
5. We expect that miners will eventually organise communities around the maintenance of these content policies in a similar way to the maintenance systems of adblocking lists on the centralised web. In terms of sharing, at the basic level we expect these to be distributed through web downloads, however it would be great if a community member made a 'subscribe to wallet' `adt_app` that loads new policy lists when a wallet distributes them in a new signed transaction. In the short term, we are also talking to the Internet Watch Foundation ( https://www.iwf.org.uk ) to get miners access to their lists, but these conversations are currently on-going.
6. Yes, storage vs hashing expenditure by miners is a tradeoff. Given the low cost of storage and the relatively high cost of energy expenditure and hashing hardware, miners are incentivised to optimise for GB-capacity before H/s. In terms of ASIC resistance: we have been running a progwork testnet for Arweave since early December. We are approaching this cautiously (for obvious reasons), but we expect to ship it in the mid-term (likely before v 2.0).

Also @Vilenarios -- I saw you signed up for the Zapier integration  


[03-Apr-19 11:16 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Build anything cool?  


[03-Apr-19 12:40 PM] tiamat#9131
Could you tell more about progwork? Will it include proof of capacity or just different PoW for ASIC resistance ?


[03-Apr-19 01:01 PM] arweave-sam#9630
As it currently stands it is just a programmatic POW, but adding a proof of (unused) hard disk capacity component would be nice. The complexity would emerge from carefully calculating the right trade-offs between proof of access, proof of work, and proof of capacity together. In particular, we would have to be careful not to introduce an incentive to favour proving empty hard drive capacity over proof of access to useful data.


[03-Apr-19 01:01 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Workable, but we haven't looked at that combination together in enough depth yet


[03-Apr-19 01:15 PM] arweave-sam#9630
For an intro to programmatic PoWs in general, this sets a good background: https://blog.sia.tech/the-state-of-cryptocurrency-mining-538004a37f9b

> At the end of the day, you will always be able to create custom hardware that can outperform general purpose hardware. 

...but it is what this statement _misses_ that gives birth to the potential for programmatic PoWs. Yes, you will always be able to create custom hardware that outperforms general purpose hardware _for specific tasks_. Progwork (and other projects like it) turn the task itself into general purpose computation -- the exact task that typical CPUs are optimised to perform well.

[03-Apr-19 01:18 PM] arweave-sam#9630
In the basic case this class of algorithms (ours included) follows the formula of hashing the input, seeding a PRNG with that hash, generating a random program and a random virtual machine CPU state, executing the VM for some  large number of instructions, then collecting the CPU state and hashing that again.


[03-Apr-19 01:20 PM] arweave-sam#9630
The hashes (of course) and the PRNG can be optimised with specialised hardware, so the number of instructions to run of the VM should be sufficient that this optimisation is not worth it.


[03-Apr-19 01:20 PM] tiamat#9131
yeah, but still wasted computation, my personal taste would be towards proof of capacity(though yea it could overlap with proof of access) or proof of stake


[03-Apr-19 01:22 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yeah, it is where we want to head eventually


[03-Apr-19 01:23 PM] tiamat#9131
also some projects have this idea of anchoring BTC or ETH blocks to avoid long private chains or don't know exactly how to call it... retroactive hashing


[03-Apr-19 01:23 PM] arweave-sam#9630
You mean like a long-range attack?


[03-Apr-19 01:23 PM] arweave-sam#9630
That would be interesting -- do you have a link to one of those projects please?


[03-Apr-19 01:24 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Would like to read about what they are doing  


[03-Apr-19 01:25 PM] tiamat#9131
block collider is first that comes into my mind which uses blocks from other chains to secure their own


[03-Apr-19 01:25 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Ahh yes, ok


[03-Apr-19 01:25 PM] tiamat#9131
the main idea is smaller chains stand no chance when it comes about hashing against a BTC farm or ETH farm, we've seen it with ETC


[03-Apr-19 01:26 PM] tiamat#9131
a single big eth farm could decide one day to attack pretty much anything below top50 CMC


[03-Apr-19 01:39 PM] tiamat#9131
anyway, I'm really glad we have a stable chain, I've seen bigger names like Zilliqa, Quarkchain, NKN getting into lots of issues and hotfixes

Not sure if any of the 'events' they offer will be useful though

Totally understand this

@tiamat Thanks! Will pass that on to the rest of the devs :).

Our start had some more difficult moments too, but it wasn't until afterwards when I looked back at the early days of other chains (to evaluate how we had done) that I realised what these launches are normally like. At least you only have to start these networks once!  


[04-Apr-19 07:57 AM] Vilenarios#8742
@arweave-sam just a simple integration that would take a file in OneDrive and copy to arweave.  Maybe even replace the file in onedrive with a link to the permaweb itself.


[04-Apr-19 07:58 AM] Vilenarios#8742
so on top of building the ArweaveDrive app, customers of other personal or business storage tools could also benefit from perma archive on arweave


[04-Apr-19 07:59 AM] Vilenarios#8742
the integration would have to be responsible for chunking the file up to get maximum cost efficiency

@tiamat Do you mean the list on the `/peers` endpoint?

no, when starting the node


[09-Apr-19 07:43 AM] tiamat#9131
I had an offline peer starting with 13.... and it was trying it first, though it was last in the cmdline


[09-Apr-19 07:55 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@tiamat Yeah, I've also noticed it's using the reverse order. Is this problem for you? You should only add peers you trust and as long as one is available the joining should succeed.


[09-Apr-19 08:09 AM] tiamat#9131
not a big problem, it's just that people would give more attention to first peers in the list

Ok, makes sense. I added a note about it and will fix it eventually.

[01-May-19 05:44 PM] arweave-sam#9630
If you are confident of the local time, perhaps connect to different nodes


[01-May-19 10:09 PM] ivhturp#3325
@slayer_hellraiser I did sync using ntp.. there is no drift in time from ntp servers
@arweave-sam Got it


[02-May-19 02:51 AM] rehash#3438
when PoS ?


[02-May-19 02:16 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@rehash Not currently on the roadmap. PoS does not fit well below proof of access, unlike proof of work


[02-May-19 02:17 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We are planning to move to a variant of programmatic proof of work though


[02-May-19 02:17 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We have our own version, but we are also looking at potentially using RandomX


[02-May-19 02:36 PM] rehash#3438
how about giving more rewards to miners that hold tokens? like 10k +10% 50k +50% or something


[02-May-19 02:37 PM] rehash#3438
PoS is nicer than PoW/progpow because speed of which new blocks arrive is much more predictable + not wasting resources


[03-May-19 01:46 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Well, i heard about decrease of mining reward, when should this happen and what will be the size of the block reward?


[03-May-19 12:17 PM] arweave-sam#9630
At block 262,800, the inflation-based reward will drop from 27.7 AR to 14.5 AR. The rest of the inflation curve is smooth.


[03-May-19 12:17 PM] rehash#3438
how about giving more rewards to miners that hold tokens? like 10k +10% 50k +50% or something


[03-May-19 12:18 PM] rehash#3438
miners should be incentivized somehow to stop dumping


[03-May-19 01:01 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-sam Approx Aug 2019?


[03-May-19 01:45 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yes, I calculate it as 104 days from now @slayer_hellraiser


[03-May-19 01:57 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@arweave-sam Thanks, i calculate same number


[03-May-19 02:35 PM] tiamat#9131
any new info about content blacklists and automated filters?


[03-May-19 02:51 PM] arweave-sam#9630
The PRs for the version with a nicer UI are currently in (the last phase of? @arweave-lev ) testing.


[03-May-19 02:52 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We also have new docs ready to go out that explain how to build the lists, load them, etc


[03-May-19 02:52 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It should be shipped in the next release or the one after


[03-May-19 03:11 PM] Marcin#0065
Can someone like me, who is pretty lazy and has no time to track the blocks and blacklist manually stuff, track a trusted node (or service) and copy the blacklists?


[03-May-19 03:15 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We plan to make it so that you can 'follow a wallet', loading each new policy that it uploads automatically


[04-May-19 02:08 PM] Paste Connoisseur#2327
Is there a test network that I can use for arweave to test my app like the ethereum test network?


[04-May-19 02:51 PM] tiamat#9131
that would be nice


[04-May-19 02:51 PM] tiamat#9131
a testnet with a few nodes would be nice to avoid mainnet pollution


[04-May-19 02:58 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@Paste Connoisseur Not right now, but you can start your own local network if you like


[04-May-19 02:59 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Setting up the mining software, then running `./arweave-server init mine` should work


[04-May-19 02:59 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@tiamat Yes, it is on the roadmap for after the next forking release


[04-May-19 03:14 PM] tiamat#9131
what is the fork addressing ? content filter or multiple txs/wallet/block?


[04-May-19 03:19 PM] arweave-sam#9630
`faster-write` we are calling it internally. It has multiple txs/wallet/block and higher max TX chunk sizes


[04-May-19 03:19 PM] arweave-sam#9630
The updated content policies will also be shipped with/before it


[04-May-19 03:20 PM] arweave-sam#9630
After the initial `faster-write` fork, we are expecting to release another update that allows miners to 'vote' on max TX chunk size by allowing miners to increase or decrease it slightly in every new block


[04-May-19 03:22 PM] arweave-sam#9630
After `faster-write`, the next _major_ project will be `fast-write` (these names will need changing   ), which uses `SPOAs` to avoid having to write the full data into the chain itself, while still preserving the perpetual incentive to be able to recall the whole data


[04-May-19 03:24 PM] arweave-sam#9630
This will be a fairly big architecture change, so it will take us quite a lot longer to ship. But after that you should be able to write data into the network at extremely high rates.


[05-May-19 04:28 AM] Lyner#9077
any devs around?


[05-May-19 04:57 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Lyner you can ask your questions, the tech team will answer you. Thanks


[05-May-19 06:03 AM] Lyner#9077
ah, I'm thinking of making a basic serverless Q&A web app for the gitcoin bounty, and I was wondering how that would  work with Arweave.  If I understood this correctly, then one approach is to designate a certain Arweave address as the destination each time user submits data to the app, right?


[05-May-19 06:03 AM] Lyner#9077
So we could query all the submitted data by looking up transactions related to the designated address


[05-May-19 07:07 AM] arweave-lev#3466
Hi @Lyner, nice idea! Yes, you can use a destination address for that. Alternatively, you could come up with a tag and collect all transactions with this tag.

Some examples from our Weavemail app. Here we assign tags to emails - https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/weavemail/blob/master/compose.js#L42. Here we fetch emails both by tags and the destination address - https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/weavemail/blob/master/inbox.js#L5.

Hey @Lyner , yep, tags are probably the best way to go here

hi, I'm having status: 410 Transaction failed when posting transaction with arweaveJs, any idea why?


[08-May-19 09:55 AM] Lyner#9077
it's working again now tho  


[08-May-19 10:09 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @Lyner glad that's working now,  if you have any further issues  let us know!  


[08-May-19 10:09 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
410 is usually only given if a transaction appears valid but is later rejected, could be too large, badly encoded, or overspending


[08-May-19 10:10 AM] Lyner#9077
noted, thanks

Hello dev team, I'm wondering where I can find a few infos about the blockchain behind arweave permaweb. I have a few ideas for apps using permaweb (which btw I find what you're doing fascinating) and would like things like the time it takes to mine a block? need to know this to see if I can implement what I'm thinking using a permaweb-like database.


[08-May-19 09:10 PM] Zeus#2212
This discord needs some groups and a little more job done   I can't easily tag the team for this question hehe.


[08-May-19 09:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
you can see time to mine a block here: https://viewblock.io/arweave/blocks


[08-May-19 09:11 PM] Zeus#2212
Thanks a lot Kent, seems to be around 2 mins per block?


[08-May-19 09:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
approximately. there is a variable difficulty level that adjusts based on the mining in the network. I don't have a link for that right now though.


[08-May-19 09:13 PM] Zeus#2212
ok thanks for the info

[09-May-19 04:06 PM] arweave-sam#9630
You are right that the block time is 2 minutes


[09-May-19 04:07 PM] arweave-sam#9630
(But with the same variance that you see with other PoW-like chains)


[09-May-19 04:11 PM] arweave-sam#9630
There is some more info on the structure of the Arweave here: https://www.arweave.org/files/arweave-lightpaper.pdf


[09-May-19 04:11 PM] arweave-sam#9630

Quick question - is it possible to look up data transactions by tag ?


[12-May-19 04:14 AM] benji#5402
I see there's the arweave.transactions.search method, can't find anything on it in the docs... Is it deprecated ?


[12-May-19 04:15 AM] benji#5402
Reason I'm asking, is that I haven't been able to get it to return anything other then an empty array so far.


[12-May-19 05:43 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@benji there is an example of fetching txs by tag and owner (but you can just fetch by tags) here - https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/weavemail/blob/master/inbox.js#L5. Hope this helps

[12-May-19 03:19 PM] benji#5402
Hi, quick question - could do with some input. I'm making an article publishing and indexing app for the Gitcoin bounty. Articles are essentially a massive string of html elements, images are embedded as base64 strings.


[12-May-19 03:20 PM] benji#5402
part of the app is an index of published articles, where I would like to display the title, an excerpt, and maybe some other high level data to do with the article


[12-May-19 03:21 PM] benji#5402
The excerpt will likely be the first x lines of the article.


[12-May-19 03:21 PM] benji#5402
It would also be great to be able to display a thumbnail image on this index page


[12-May-19 03:22 PM] benji#5402
My question is : Is there a field on the transaction where I can store these things other then the 'data' field ?


[12-May-19 03:23 PM] benji#5402
(we definitely don't want to download the entire content of every article we wish to list in the index.)


[12-May-19 03:33 PM] benji#5402
I'm not going to bother experimenting with jamming data into the `tags` fields (I know that's not what they're for :p)

Most obvious solution I have in my head is this :

Article should be split into 2 transactions : 

1 - Main Article Content
2 - Article Meta including synopsis, thumbnail image etc


[12-May-19 04:14 PM] arweave-lev#3466
@benji Splitting it into two transactions sounds reasonable to me. Also tags can be no bigger than 4 KB in total.


[12-May-19 04:44 PM] benji#5402
aha ! brilliant  


[12-May-19 05:06 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Hey @benji


[12-May-19 05:06 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Putting images in the tags might be a bit far


[12-May-19 05:06 PM] benji#5402
Hi Sam  


[12-May-19 05:06 PM] arweave-sam#9630
 


[12-May-19 05:07 PM] arweave-sam#9630
But they are good for general metadata


[12-May-19 05:07 PM] benji#5402
Yep, as I thought


[12-May-19 05:07 PM] benji#5402
I've settled for the two transaction approach


[12-May-19 05:07 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Nice


[12-May-19 05:08 PM] arweave-sam#9630
You might have to be careful about transaction queueing if you do that


[12-May-19 05:08 PM] benji#5402
Don't think I've come across that term so far.


[12-May-19 05:08 PM] arweave-sam#9630
You will need to create a kind of system for waiting until the previous transaction has settled before sending along the next one


[12-May-19 05:09 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We are actually changing this at the protocol level with the next hard fork


[12-May-19 05:09 PM] benji#5402
Would you mind elucidating on 'settled'


[12-May-19 05:09 PM] arweave-sam#9630
So it might be best to drop the images and just use the tags for now?


[12-May-19 05:09 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Mined into a block


[12-May-19 05:09 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Returning `200` on the `/tx/[id]/status` endpoint


[12-May-19 05:10 PM] benji#5402
Why is it necessary to wait ?


[12-May-19 05:12 PM] arweave-sam#9630
You need to make sure that the `last_tx` value for the second TX is correct, and that the first TX _definitely_ arrives before the second


[12-May-19 05:12 PM] benji#5402
Ahhhh ok, that's a headache.


[12-May-19 05:13 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yeah, it is so that a malicious attacker cannot send a bunch of transactions that can never be mined and have them cached in the mempool for too long


[12-May-19 05:13 PM] arweave-sam#9630
As our transactions are big, it is more important than for other networks


[12-May-19 05:15 PM] arweave-sam#9630
But we should have the next version out in the next month or so, that allows you to 'spray' as many TXs as you like at the network, and as long as the valid 'chain' appears within a reasonable period, it works


[12-May-19 05:18 PM] benji#5402
'spray' ha.. made me think of a 🐱


[12-May-19 05:19 PM] benji#5402
So, eventually, I'll be able to submit two TXN's


[12-May-19 05:19 PM] benji#5402
the first will be the article body


[12-May-19 05:20 PM] benji#5402
and the second will be the meta data for the indexing, which will reference the first's txn id


[12-May-19 05:20 PM] benji#5402
for the moment though, I'll leave the images out and make it pure text.


[12-May-19 05:22 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Sounds good!!


[12-May-19 05:22 PM] benji#5402
cool.


[12-May-19 05:22 PM] benji#5402
I'll do that so  


[12-May-19 06:58 PM] 2072 [ANFRA]#9291
Hi, are there any plans to improve the blockchain storage size/effectiveness in the near future?
My mining node is near its storage capacity and I'll have to either stop it or buy more storage...


[12-May-19 07:14 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Hey @2072 [ANFRA] !


[12-May-19 07:16 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yes, we plan to move from a wallet list system an append only wallet log, which will greatly cut down the overhead in the hard fork after next (2 major releases away).


[12-May-19 07:16 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Because it uses a blockweave though, you don't need to store all of it


[12-May-19 07:17 PM] arweave-sam#9630
You just get rewarded for the proportion of the weave that you do store.


[12-May-19 07:18 PM] arweave-sam#9630
So if you are filled to capacity now, you will be able to keep mining most of blocks for the next month, then > 50% for the first year, etc.


[13-May-19 08:34 AM] Zeus#2212
Hello team and members of Arweave   I'm almost finishing an idea I have that will be built on top of Arweave. I'm wondering, is there a way to encrypt a text and be decrypted only by a user after he send a transaction with some tag?


[13-May-19 08:35 AM] Zeus#2212
since we wouldn't know the receiver pubkey in advance


[13-May-19 08:48 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@Zeus perhaps, it will suit you to create a temporary key in advance, which the sender would share with the recipient as soon as the recipient shares his public key?


[13-May-19 08:53 AM] Zeus#2212
Thank you @arweave-lev gonna explain a little more via PM ^_^


[13-May-19 04:19 PM] benji#5402
Hi, am having issues posting a data transaction to the weave


[13-May-19 04:20 PM] benji#5402
getting a 400 response `Transaction verification failed.`


[13-May-19 04:22 PM] benji#5402
I have a test txn which is using the same key to sign, so must be something up with my data.


[13-May-19 04:24 PM] benji#5402
ok looks like I'm stuffing too much data into a tag  


[13-May-19 04:53 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @benji is that all working now? Feel free to drop us a repo link if you need a hand debugging


[13-May-19 06:22 PM] benji#5402
not quite, I'm still trying to track down exactly what it is that's causing it to fail


[13-May-19 06:23 PM] benji#5402
what are the limitations of the tag fields, are there any characters that aren't supported ?


[13-May-19 06:42 PM] benji#5402
solved ... encodeURI  


[13-May-19 08:14 PM] arweave-sam#9630
 


[13-May-19 08:14 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Glad it worked out


[13-May-19 08:15 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I was just checking for you about the accepted character set


[14-May-19 10:10 AM] Shaun#7903
Hey guys, I've noticed you guys added the jiffy NIF in the project since Erlang isn't the best at string operations. Have you guys also considered calling some C libraries for cryptographic operations?


[14-May-19 10:10 AM] Shaun#7903
I'm not an expert in Erlang by the way, just sharing some thoughts


[14-May-19 10:27 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@Shaun the Erlang `crypto` library is also using NIFs so cryptographic operations are efficient.


[14-May-19 10:30 AM] Shaun#7903
oh gotcha, I just looked for the C++ and C files in the codebase and noticed it's all from the jiffy library, hence why I asked about it  


[14-May-19 10:33 AM] Lyner#9077
guys, can ArQL use owner address of the tx as the query ?


[14-May-19 11:33 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@Shaun happy to clarify, feel free to ask any questions!

@Lyner yep, use `'to'` for `'expr1'`

Yep @Shaun , we will also be moving away from JSON for default storage/transfer soon enough, too


[14-May-19 01:56 PM] arweave-sam#9630
IIRC we were still debating the various other options out there (MessagePack, etc. or even Erlang's term serialisation format)


[15-May-19 12:57 AM] tiamat#9131
@arweave-sam what's wrong with JSON?


[15-May-19 12:57 AM] tiamat#9131
why some nodes have 400+ peers?


[15-May-19 03:47 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@tiamat JSON is relatively big so consumes bandwidth when traveling over the wire and storage when put on disk. Also it is relatively slow to parse. We have to keep backwards-compatibility with JSON in the API cause it's very convenient to have it there but we can introduce a different serialisation format to improve the rest.

Which nodes are you referring to?


[15-May-19 04:26 AM] tiamat#9131
@arweave-lev 139.59.51.59:1984 425 peers


[15-May-19 05:04 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@tiamat That's one of our own nodes. It's probably behind a load balancer so that it gets web traffic. The node cannot distinguish between a request from a web browser and from another node, so web browsers' IP addresses will be in the peer list for a while.


[15-May-19 08:19 AM] Lyner#9077
> timeout of 20000ms exceeded
happened when trying to deploy a file, what's wrong?  


[15-May-19 08:28 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Sounds like a connection issue?


[15-May-19 08:29 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We constantly ping the gateway nodes to check latency and we haven't noticed anything


[15-May-19 08:33 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Does it happen consistently @Lyner ?


[15-May-19 09:56 AM] Lyner#9077
yeah probably connection, its working now

[16-May-19 09:08 PM] aurora#3501
what type of stuff can be built on permaweb ? any frontend project that uses external apis can be built ?


[16-May-19 09:09 PM] aurora#3501
or just arweave functions can be called and not an external api ?


[16-May-19 09:58 PM] Zeus#2212
hey @aurora   in fact you can use the permaweb as a db or to get data from it externally, and you can also only have a permaweb site and interact with external APIs, but just keep in mind that your permaweb is permanent, while an external API isn't, it will change for sure at one point  


[16-May-19 10:00 PM] Zeus#2212
but yeah, Arweave isn't "enclosed" or anything like that. So you can interact from and with external sites/data. Here's something I found useful that explain a little about why package your apps with only permaweb content https://docs.arweave.org/developers/tools/arweave-deploy/html-packaging


[16-May-19 10:46 PM] arweave-sam#9630
:+1:


[16-May-19 10:46 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Thanks, @Zeus !


[18-May-19 08:21 AM] Vilenarios#8742
@arweave-sam so now with ArweaveID, it should be possible to have private files on Arweave right?  Or even full access control lists on a given file... maybe?


[18-May-19 08:42 AM] arweave-sam#9630
> private files on Arweave right?
No more private than before


[18-May-19 08:42 AM] arweave-sam#9630
ArweaveID just links up addresses with human readable strings for different categories (name, DiscordID, etc)


[18-May-19 08:43 AM] Vilenarios#8742
So currently, i can upload a picture and restrict it so im the only one who can view it?


[18-May-19 08:43 AM] Vilenarios#8742
i thought it was just public by default


[18-May-19 08:43 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You can encrypt it


[18-May-19 08:44 AM] arweave-sam#9630
But you can't make it totally private


[18-May-19 08:44 AM] Vilenarios#8742
hmm okay


[18-May-19 08:44 AM] Vilenarios#8742
ya i understand i can encrypt via my own means


[18-May-19 08:44 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Metadata would still leak, like the size of the file etc


[18-May-19 08:44 AM] Vilenarios#8742
i was just thinking about the use case for pictures


[18-May-19 08:44 AM] Vilenarios#8742
or, my pictures at least


[18-May-19 08:45 AM] Vilenarios#8742
i want them to last forever and to easily be passed down to my generations


[18-May-19 08:45 AM] Vilenarios#8742
but


[18-May-19 08:45 AM] Vilenarios#8742
i dont want them public


[18-May-19 08:45 AM] Vilenarios#8742
so if i could pass my keys, which essentially, would haveall my pics, that could be cool


[18-May-19 08:45 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep


[18-May-19 08:47 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The weak link here is the encryption algorithms themselves


[18-May-19 08:47 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Over a long enough period of time, they tend to be weakened to new types of computers


[18-May-19 10:12 AM] CODYX#0557
Hello there. Currently developing an Arweave app and using the GO SDK. But since Go is a "backend" language, I was wondering what would be the best way to pair it with my frontend that I'll host on the Arweave... Do you guys have suggestions? At this point I'm thinking about hosting the Go API on my own in the Cloud


[18-May-19 10:14 AM] Zeus#2212
Hey @CODYX yes exactly, you will need the backend to interact with Arweave and the frontend to do the same, both places (backend and frontend) don't need to talk to eachother for it to work. On the backend you use the GO SDK and on the frontend the JavaScript API.


[18-May-19 10:15 AM] Zeus#2212
unless you need to send some non permaweb data of course  


[18-May-19 10:17 AM] CODYX#0557
Thanks @Zeus   


[18-May-19 10:20 AM] Zeus#2212
Anytime  


[18-May-19 11:25 AM] 0xluis#2117
Hello, I wanted to ask, is it possible to use personal domains with deployed HTML pages, and if so, how can I hook that up?


[18-May-19 11:25 AM] 0xluis#2117
Also, another minor thing


[18-May-19 11:27 AM] 0xluis#2117
I tried using `arweave package index.html packaged.html` to package an HTML file with some references to other files, however, I received an error on something that is enclosed in comments; it seems that it doesn't seem to recognize CSS comments?


[18-May-19 11:27 AM] 0xluis#2117
In other words, I'm receiving: `File not found while importing CSS:     src: url("../fonts/museosans_500/MuseoSans_500-webfont.ttf");`


[18-May-19 11:28 AM] 0xluis#2117
And, here is the commented block: 
```
/*@font-face {

        font-family: Museo Sans;
        src: url("../fonts/museosans_500/MuseoSans_500-webfont.ttf");
}*/
```


[18-May-19 11:44 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hey @arweave-kyle -- any idea what @0xluis 's problem might be?


[18-May-19 11:45 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Can you try running with `--verbose` @0xluis ?


[18-May-19 11:46 AM] arweave-sam#9630
At the moment the simplest way to attach the site to a DNS address is to use a Cloudflare worker


[18-May-19 11:46 AM] arweave-sam#9630
It is not pretty, nor is it decentralised


[18-May-19 11:46 AM] arweave-sam#9630
But it works and is fast


[18-May-19 11:46 AM] 0xluis#2117
Hmmmm


[18-May-19 11:47 AM] 0xluis#2117
It's telling me it's an unknown option


[18-May-19 11:47 AM] Zeus#2212
Hey @0xluis any css url wont be packaged, that's the problem here


[18-May-19 11:47 AM] Zeus#2212
is that a google font?


[18-May-19 11:47 AM] arweave-sam#9630
With the second release of the gateway system, you will be able to attach DNS to a specific gateway and TXID


[18-May-19 11:48 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@Zeus Ah, yes, you had the same thing before right?


[18-May-19 11:48 AM] Zeus#2212
what I did to make it work for example on one of my sites is link the font in the head of the page


[18-May-19 11:48 AM] 0xluis#2117
the thing is, that is commented out


[18-May-19 11:49 AM] 0xluis#2117
So I feel it shouldn't parsing it...?


[18-May-19 11:49 AM] 0xluis#2117
@arweave-sam Is there documentation on that? Apologies, I'm having trouble finding it D:


[18-May-19 11:49 AM] Zeus#2212
yeah true, mmm strange


[18-May-19 11:49 AM] 0xluis#2117
Thank you so much for responding so quickly!  


[18-May-19 11:49 AM] Zeus#2212
yes there is, I forgot the name of the npm package used to "package" everything


[18-May-19 11:49 AM] Zeus#2212
@arweave-sam do you remember it?


[18-May-19 11:50 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We are (almost) always here   @0xluis


[18-May-19 11:50 AM] Zeus#2212
someone told it to me here the other day haha


[18-May-19 11:50 AM] arweave-sam#9630
At least someone that can help  


[18-May-19 11:50 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Errrrr


[18-May-19 11:50 AM] arweave-sam#9630

I guess I will try to use the package, and probably raise an issue there haha


[18-May-19 11:56 AM] Zeus#2212
still don't get why it's trying to do something with those lines, as you say, they are commented haha

Yeah, that is pretty strange behaviour  


[18-May-19 05:39 PM] 0xluis#2117
Another quick question


[18-May-19 05:39 PM] 0xluis#2117
I managed to try deploying something


[18-May-19 05:40 PM] 0xluis#2117
Though, I got:
```
Trasaction ID: 2tdcG85pYICnHGn8ddVwfQLGUjkae8DFDQWsBSMC7Lo
Status: 410 Transaction failed
```


[18-May-19 05:40 PM] 0xluis#2117
Then, when I tried to resubmit it again, I got:


[18-May-19 05:40 PM] 0xluis#2117
```
Failed to submit transaction, unexpected status: 208 - Transaction already processed.
```


[18-May-19 05:41 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Interesting one!


[18-May-19 05:41 PM] 0xluis#2117
Is there a way to check this Transaction ID somewhere? Any tips for debugging?


[18-May-19 05:41 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Let me check the TXID on a few nodes...


[18-May-19 05:41 PM] 0xluis#2117
Sure, thanks!


[18-May-19 05:42 PM] arweave-sam#9630
`410 Gone` usually means that two transactions were submitted from the same wallet (without properly chaining the `last_tx` value) before the first one settled


[18-May-19 05:43 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Is that possible in this case?


[18-May-19 05:43 PM] arweave-sam#9630
The 208 is weird though


[18-May-19 05:43 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Oh


[18-May-19 05:43 PM] 0xluis#2117

[18-May-19 05:44 PM] 0xluis#2117
My guess is that 0.097941608307 AR is too cheap


[18-May-19 05:46 PM] 0xluis#2117
This is the command I'm running, if it helps:

[18-May-19 05:56 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Price should be set automically


[18-May-19 05:58 PM] arweave-sam#9630
There is a very small possibility that you got the price just before the network changed it


[18-May-19 05:58 PM] arweave-sam#9630
The chance of that is extremely low, though


[18-May-19 05:58 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Does this happen repeatedly?


[18-May-19 06:00 PM] 0xluis#2117
Hmmmm


[18-May-19 06:00 PM] 0xluis#2117
It does


[18-May-19 06:00 PM] 0xluis#2117
I can try running it again now


[18-May-19 06:01 PM] 0xluis#2117
Hmmm, yeah, I still get `Failed to submit transaction, unexpected status: 208 - Transaction already processed.`


[18-May-19 06:59 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Very strange


[18-May-19 07:00 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@arweave-kyle -- any idea?


[18-May-19 07:04 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Have you tried uploading a different file @0xluis


[18-May-19 07:11 PM] 0xluis#2117
Sure, I can try

Hello, just one more thing; I was curious, is there some way to deploy webapps written in React, e.g. via create-react-app? I've been trying to use https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap, but I'm curious to know if there is a successful method that you recommend


[19-May-19 09:45 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hey @0xluis -- yes, I know people have done this


[19-May-19 09:46 AM] 0xluis#2117
Great! We ended up trying it, but unfortunately, the front-end was too large


[19-May-19 09:46 AM] 0xluis#2117
Hmmm, it seems I can't paste an image here directly


[19-May-19 09:47 AM] 0xluis#2117
But it was around ~13 MB total, a transaction is max at 2 MB I think?


[19-May-19 09:47 AM] 0xluis#2117
It's probably because the front-end also had solc packed in and a few other tools


[19-May-19 09:49 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Ah, yeah


[19-May-19 09:49 AM] arweave-sam#9630
That is over the limit for now


[19-May-19 09:49 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We are increasing it soon


[19-May-19 09:50 AM] 0xluis#2117
Ahhh, I see, ok!


[19-May-19 12:31 PM] taras#7777
@arweave-sam When listing on exchange?


[19-May-19 12:36 PM] benji#5402
@0xluis there is react and react ts starter on thearweave GitHub, I used it with no issues.


[19-May-19 12:38 PM] benji#5402
Also, might be worth making sure that your components are using best practices when importing modules so treeshaking is working properly


[20-May-19 07:23 AM] ivhturp#3325
Was any stress test going on the network? I just noticed decent number of 1AR txns that happened in 24 hrs. Or is it integration test being done by exchange :arweave: :arweave:


[20-May-19 07:27 AM] arweave-india#5075
Heya @ivhturp - that was us on the team moving some tokens around (creating some new 'free AR' wallets for our adoption drives   )

{Reactions}
  (2) 

[20-May-19 12:35 PM] JustMaier#0425
Do you guys have plans for improving the Arweave login experience? Having to select a wallet/key every time you want to use an App isn't the ideal experience.


[20-May-19 12:43 PM] JustMaier#0425
A few things come to mind:
1. A browser extension
2. An app wrapper that has access to the stored key and asks the user if they want to grant permission to the app


[20-May-19 12:44 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Hey @JustMaier !


[20-May-19 12:44 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep to both, actually


[20-May-19 12:45 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We are building this system we call (codename) `ArPal`

It is basically a way of differing trust to the web extension wallet, or the gateway node you are using

1) Is there a way to get traffic statistics(at least something basic) for a page served by arweave.net ? 2) What's the reason of using .org for general information and .net for file serving? Isn't .org more safe in terms of abuses? I haven't researched much on the subject, but I see the .org of thepiratebay still up after so many years of tries to shut it down ?

[21-May-19 06:14 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@tiamat No traffic stats at the moment. This is an interesting policy question -- at the moment, IIRC, we do not track any access data through the gateway.


[21-May-19 06:15 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You should be able to use typical traffic software in your app though, if you so desire

Hey @benji, if I understand you correctly, you can view a transaction date by heading over to https://viewblock.io/arweave/tx/*TX-ID*

You can use the node software like a wallet @tiamat

[22-May-19 09:22 AM] JustMaier#0425
Is there an Arweave test net for development, or do we need to clone the arweave repo and run locally to test?

You can run a node locally @JustMaier

We will setup a public test net after the next HF  


[22-May-19 02:20 PM] JustMaier#0425
@arweave-sam would that be the same as setting up a miner?


[22-May-19 03:37 PM] arweave-lev#3466
@JustMaier you need to change the minimal difficulty to something small (say, 16); the default one would be too hard for a single machine so it won't produce blocks. https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/blob/master/src/ar.hrl#L54

And then running `./arweave-server init mine` should do it. You can access it on `localhost:1984`.

@arweave-lev I wasn't able to do `init mine` without erl crashing. Could be because I have it in a docker container, but I can't see why that would be the cause.


[23-May-19 02:06 PM] JustMaier#0425
If I do it without `init` it starts up fine and I can hit the node via http


[23-May-19 02:06 PM] JustMaier#0425
However the problem then is getting a wallet that I can use to make requests. Or will I not need a wallet?

It may be a case (for example) of missing genesis wallet files


[23-May-19 02:27 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@arweave-kyle did you have experience starting a weave like this for testing recently?


[23-May-19 02:36 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
@arweave-sam @JustMaier Have used arweave in docked fine before but I’ve not done so super recently — @arweave-lev or @arweave-martin might be able to help if something has changed or let us know if it’s not stable?

Generally though, if you generate some wallets using the chrome extension, then add them with balances to

https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/blob/stable/data/genesis_wallets.csv

And then launch the node with the init flag, those new addresses will have the balance specified in the genesis file

[23-May-19 02:36 PM] arweave-lev#3466
Forgot about tokens   In order to get some tokens, you need to add a line with your address to `data/genesis_wallets.csv`. `init mine` should work, worked for me recently. @JustMaier logs would be helpful (`make catlog`)


[23-May-19 02:37 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
You’ll need to update your settings in thechrome extension to add your node IP address for it to show the correct balances, the extension will just show mainnet balances from arweave.net by default


[23-May-19 02:49 PM] JustMaier#0425
@arweave-lev I'll try adding to the genesis csv and see if that fixes my problem with `init mine`

If you decode, then hash (sha2-256), then encode in b64u again, you get the address :)

[27-May-19 02:01 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@JustMaier @Paste Connoisseur unfortunately you can only submit one tx per block from a single wallet at the moment. The second one has to be submitted after the first is included into the block. We are working on adding support for submitting multiple transactions per wallet per block.

{Reactions}
😩 (2)  

[27-May-19 02:03 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You can actually get multiple txs per wallet per block now, but you need to manually adjust the `last_tx` value and be _absolutely sure_ that the first transaction has been distributed to every node before the second one.


[27-May-19 02:04 AM] arweave-sam#9630
This second condition is normally extremely difficult to achieve, particularly for larger data transactions


[27-May-19 02:04 AM] arweave-sam#9630
But as Lev said, an upcoming patch will remove this issue.


[27-May-19 02:08 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@arweave-sam no I do not think it's possible, `last_tx` is only looked for among the transactions already included into the blocks (put into the wallet list, to be precise, and it's not put until the block is processed).

your node does not need any private information except for your mining address, but no keys are required and it's actually not recommended to store wallet/keys on the node

@JustMaier the block size limit is going to be the limit (~ 10 MB). Later we are planning to introduce voting for the block size so that it can be increased by miners' consensus.


[27-May-19 09:54 AM] JustMaier#0425
@arweave-lev so after the patch I could post unlimited transactions to a single block as long as the total size is under the block limit of 10MB?


[27-May-19 09:55 AM] arweave-lev#3466
Yep


[27-May-19 11:06 AM] JustMaier#0425
Wanna see something crazy?! How about a client-side arweave proxy using a service worker and ArQL
https://arweave-sw.netlify.com/@justmaier/@me/index.html

{Reactions}
arweave (2) 

[27-May-19 11:06 AM] JustMaier#0425
  that registers a service worker that can capture a specific pattern and then queries the arweave network for transactions that match that pattern


[27-May-19 11:07 AM] JustMaier#0425
After registering the worker, it will proxy all pattern matched requests through the Arweave service worker


[27-May-19 11:07 AM] JustMaier#0425
Check out how it works here: https://github.com/JustMaier/arweave-service-worker


[27-May-19 11:08 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Amazing stuff


[27-May-19 11:09 AM] arweave-sam#9630
This is going to be awesome


[27-May-19 11:09 AM] JustMaier#0425
After registering the worker, you can hit things like:

Nice @JustMaier what's the setup for that like ?


[27-May-19 05:09 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep @benji , seems the setup is going to be key


[27-May-19 05:10 PM] arweave-sam#9630
If we can make it simple enough, it will be an enormous step forward for usability


[27-May-19 05:10 PM] benji#5402
semantically pretty deeplinks  


[27-May-19 05:10 PM] arweave-sam#9630

[27-May-19 05:10 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It is the update bit that I think could be really big


[27-May-19 05:11 PM] arweave-sam#9630
This would allow us to 'dump' static site generator outputs on the weave super easily


[27-May-19 05:11 PM] arweave-sam#9630
So immediately loads of blog generators, for example, would begin to work


[27-May-19 05:12 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Without modification


[27-May-19 05:12 PM] arweave-sam#9630

[27-May-19 08:03 PM] JustMaier#0425
Lots to experiment with still. One big hang up that exists at the moment is the limit to 1 TX per block. That limit makes it hard to deploy a whole site.

to be honest discord direct messages are something the user must switch on themselves


[15-Sep-17 01:05 AM] mrwagner#6108
so requires user disclipline

unless you  make them wait in a lobby channel till you can verify they have turned it off

are there specific types of document/pages that are most beneficial to save through archain?


[15-Sep-17 10:34 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@Jacwil: Anything that you or others may want to refer back to in the future. News, old websites with useful/'rare' information, etc. If it makes you think 'huh, I didn't know that', we would love for you to Archain it.


[15-Sep-17 10:36 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The Archain company (Minimum Spanning Technologies Limited) will be archiving, for example, a record of everything said in the UK parliament. Likely the human genome (across multiple blocks), too.


[15-Sep-17 10:40 AM] Jacwil#4297
Very interesting! is it only webpages that can be archived? pdf's etc that may have interesting or sensitive info @arweave-sam


[15-Sep-17 11:57 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@Jacwil: Indeed, PDFs etc. will be archivable. We would like to build a content extractor for them, too, that would save users the cost of archiving the entire file. We expect that the PDF text extractor will be integrated sometime after the initial launch, however.


[15-Sep-17 12:20 PM] bhaskarven#3731
how do we download archain wallet


[15-Sep-17 12:52 PM] Jacwil#4297
@arweave-sam  Sounds like a great idea.  It sounds like it could have an arm that acts as a wikileaks-esque function? what would happen should confidential files or the like be uploaded illegaly?  - to go one step further, how will you prevent people from archiving innapropriate content such as CP etc.

Welcome to the Archain Discord server! 

To prevent spam you must have a verified account and be a member of this server for more than 10 minutes in order to post.

Please note that Archain staff will never send you discord messages asking you for your wallet details for ARC, BTC or ETH. 
As a precaution, we recommend you turn your direct messages off (you can learn how to do that here - https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000068672-Discord-Safety-Safe-Messaging-).

new  users need to see the message


[15-Sep-17 04:25 PM] jon-archain#4445
ideally it would be a dm but that doesn't seem possible with tatsumaki right now


[15-Sep-17 04:27 PM] joannaz#8342
Set it as the channel topic?


[15-Sep-17 04:28 PM] jon-archain#4445
i'm not sure that's obvious enough to new viewers


[15-Sep-17 04:28 PM] jon-archain#4445

maybe create something like #welcome

and have the bot shoot the welcome there


[15-Sep-17 04:41 PM] jon-archain#4445

[15-Sep-17 04:41 PM] mrwagner#6108

and is the coin ARC?


[16-Sep-17 04:55 AM] Eminem#1051

when is it planned to hit any exchange? i cant find it on the roadmap


[16-Sep-17 09:04 AM] Jacwil#4297
Around the same time as the main network release I think


[16-Sep-17 09:53 AM] cleonesr#2951
Sorry if this question has already been answered, but just wondering when are tokens will be made available for us to deposit in our wallets such as MEW?


[16-Sep-17 10:27 AM] mec1988#6670
Probably the same answer as above


[16-Sep-17 10:34 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hi @Eminem: @Jacwil is right. It will be when the network is launched. You will be able to load your wallet details into the Archain client at this time, too.


[16-Sep-17 12:33 PM] Eminem#1051
So, Could you tell me the estimated month at which ARC will be available to exchanges?


[16-Sep-17 01:56 PM] Jacwil#4297
@Eminem just assume somewhere between Jan and March 2018 until you hear otherwise. This info is on their website as well.


[16-Sep-17 06:49 PM] Kumi#0610
I see you were talking about bots and welcoming messages earlier. I would advice you not to switch to a bot which PMs new users, they are not appreciated. What most large servers do these days is automatically assign all new users a special role which gives them access to only the welcome channel. Upon joining they are mentioned in a message giving them all the information a new user needs. After the user has read the message they type the, by the bot, given phrase and their role is changed to one which has access to all other channels but not the welcoming one.


[16-Sep-17 07:03 PM] Dann#7704
@Kumi Interesting, thank you for the advice - why are they not appreciated? I would imagine having to manually type a command in would be more time consuming than just jumping on and getting involved immediately.


[16-Sep-17 07:07 PM] Kumi#0610
They aren't appreciated primarily because people would rather get pinged in the relevant server and partly because it's usually the same bot which sends the message, though it's for different servers, so it all gets mixed in the same place. The reason a lot of servers have it so that new users have to type a command is just to make sure they read the message, perhaps that is not something you are interested in.


[16-Sep-17 07:10 PM] Dann#7704
It would entirely depend on the demographic and how they interact with the platform. I can appreciate the interaction a user would receive from having to enter a command as to show that they understand the concepts.


[16-Sep-17 07:11 PM] Dann#7704
Albeit it may put some people off, but it's interesting to get that feedback as it's not something that may be obvious.


[16-Sep-17 07:12 PM] karthik#8506
It will be better than no one answering for 12-15 hrs


[16-Sep-17 07:16 PM] Kumi#0610
Indeed it would. My experience is primarily from servers quite unlike this one, so it's entirely possible that the sentiment will be different here. Mee is a widely used bot despite that many dislike it simply because the server admins find it an elegant solution.


[16-Sep-17 07:20 PM] Dann#7704
That's interesting regarding users dislike of the bot. It's early days so hopefully we can provide a more friendly experience and not so spammy one   . Although if it comes to it, we'll gut out the Mee6 bot and find a better replacement.

@karthik Sorry I haven't been active today, it's been an awfully busy day for me. Did you have any questions that I can help with?


[16-Sep-17 07:25 PM] karthik#8506
No, just explaining in a 24*7 world it is hard to expect a human to greet you all the time and bot can play a role.


[16-Sep-17 07:26 PM] Dann#7704
Ah, well that's very true! The biggest difficulty is working around timezones :3


[16-Sep-17 09:44 PM] HiteshB#8784
When sales start, will the price of 1 ARC be higher than what it was in the pre-sale?


[16-Sep-17 09:45 PM] HiteshB#8784
Power Ledger was another ICO I invested in in their pre sales, their public sales price is 5x lower than what it was in the pre-sale

@HiteshB may be due to the low crypto prices nowadays!


[17-Sep-17 03:06 AM] Dandy#8330
Or maybe the functional value of the specific coin was overevaluated


[17-Sep-17 10:46 AM] Eminem#1051
So what price could be expect for ARC?
More than the presale or lesser?


[17-Sep-17 11:01 AM] jazz010#3197
probably less.


[17-Sep-17 11:05 AM] karthik#8506
@HiteshB How come such a big difference in powerledger pricing? Either they should have compensated presale owners (or) issued more tokens proportionately


[17-Sep-17 12:14 PM] HiteshB#8784
They just did it, no questions asked. I had around 0.5 ltc in the pre-sale, saw the sales and got irritated lol...


[17-Sep-17 12:14 PM] HiteshB#8784
Anyhow, I have faith in Archain  


[17-Sep-17 03:32 PM] Dann#7704
The pre-sale value of ARC was initially 0.09GBP to 1 ARC for the first tranche, then the second tranches sale value was 0.14GBP with each tranche totalling 5m ARC I believe. During the main-sale it's subject to change but I imagine it'll follow a similar scheme seen in the pre-sale. 

All pre-sales had a 25% bonus, that's one of the big factors for anyone who contributed in the pre-sale.


[17-Sep-17 09:11 PM] iovoid#6259
Is there a public database about balance distribution?


[18-Sep-17 07:30 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hi @iovoid, not currently. You can, however, view your Archain wallet using the link we sent to you after your order. If you would like another copy of this message, just shoot us an email to team@archain.org.


[18-Sep-17 07:47 AM] HiteshB#8784
@Dann thanks  


[19-Sep-17 09:27 PM] iovoid#6259
I never got such message because I had issues with the system (I had to mail you for the payment to get marked as done). What data do you need to resend email (TXID? Order ID?)?


[20-Sep-17 06:56 AM] Patziggy#9371
Hello everyone! Does anyone know when we could expect to see our Archain tokens from the ICO?


[20-Sep-17 12:46 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Hi @iovoid: Just an email from the address you used in your order would be fine! We can use the address to find your order.


[20-Sep-17 12:48 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@Patziggy: Welcome to our Discord community! The tokens will be usable when you load in your wallet details on the live network (which will launch late Q1 of 2018).


[20-Sep-17 01:26 PM] Patziggy#9371
Thanks @arweave-sam! As a historian I'm very much looking forward to this project developing.


[20-Sep-17 01:29 PM] Patziggy#9371
Great article explaining the fragility of data just how important projects like Archain are and will be to future generations: http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/internet-history-fragile-archive-making-sure-doesnt-disappear/


[25-Sep-17 06:33 PM] Puck342#3354
Hello! finally made it over here after the Slack got closed down


[25-Sep-17 06:35 PM] Puck342#3354
Was wondering if there was any change in timeline (positive or negative) in the past 3-4 weeks?


[26-Sep-17 12:28 PM] WillRogerJones#8527
Hi Puck


[26-Sep-17 12:28 PM] WillRogerJones#8527
Our timeline for release is about the same, we still feel we're on target


[26-Sep-17 01:41 PM] Puck342#3354
awesome! been busy lately and hadn't had a chance to check in here  


[26-Sep-17 01:42 PM] Puck342#3354
also, admittedly, two other ICO coins I had invested in just had separate instances of "actually we are moving back our timelines...." so i wanted to make sure that wasn't the case here lol


[27-Sep-17 09:08 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Indeed, @Puck342. We are actually considering releasing 'Archain core' (permanent data storage network, not the internet archiving layer) potentially even earlier than expected (although we certainly can't make any promises about that yet).  While this would mean that the community could get started with the data storage technology, apps and theirs wallets earlier, we are hesitant to do this because we don't want it to be misinterpreted as a move away from our commitment to the Archain internet archiving system. This still remainins absolutely vital to Archain, it is simply that the software is split into distinct layers that could feasibly be delivered seperately. The internet archiving relies on the core, so that is the first part we are focussing on.

Conceivably, I could see that some people that aren't following the project too closely would see this as a re-definition of the product, which would be a great shame, as it is simply that the product is deliverable in stages. I would love to hear the thoughts of the community about this, if they have any?

(Once again, we can't make any promises about the early release of archain-core, yet, please understand that this is currently just at the ideas stage.)


[27-Sep-17 11:06 AM] Puck342#3354
if you controlled the messaging such that it was clear that this was just Step 1 of a 2,3,4,etc step process...or called it something like Archain Base Layer to really drive home how "this isn't the end, it's only the beginning" - early delivery of a stand-alone feature could work


[27-Sep-17 11:06 AM] Puck342#3354
though I recognize what you mean when you say that you are worried there could be some confusion. More than enough misinformation is floating around in the crypto space in general than any of us need


[27-Sep-17 12:27 PM] arweave-sam#9630
That is certainly true.

Explicitly calling it 'phase'/'step' 1 is a good idea. I will definitely keep that in mind!


[27-Sep-17 12:27 PM] Puck342#3354
I do happen to work in marketing  


[27-Sep-17 12:28 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Ah, interesting!


[27-Sep-17 12:29 PM] Puck342#3354
it certainly is sometimes


[27-Sep-17 08:03 PM] bhaskarven#3731
all gone no message for a week huh


[28-Sep-17 10:56 AM] jon-archain#4445
@bhaskarven  Is there anything we can help you with?


[01-Oct-17 02:01 PM] HiteshB#8784
How's the roadmap looking so far? Still on schedule?


[02-Oct-17 04:27 AM] TopHat888#8640
Could you please share some info on how the raised funds are being used? I remember you said that you were going to use some for marketing. @Dann


[02-Oct-17 07:06 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Yes! Still on Schedule


[02-Oct-17 07:28 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
We're happy to share this info. We have spent a small amount on marketing, with most of the rest budgeted for office space and paying our development team. We have also allocated a small portion for legal and accounting costs.


[02-Oct-17 10:48 AM] bhaskarven#3731
hello


[02-Oct-17 10:49 AM] jon-archain#4445
@bhaskarven  Hi   We saw your message on thursday and wondered what we can help you with?


[02-Oct-17 10:50 AM] bhaskarven#3731
there is silence here now not many people chatting


[02-Oct-17 10:51 AM] jon-archain#4445
Well, people from archain will always be about to chat!


[02-Oct-17 10:51 AM] bhaskarven#3731
ok thanks


[02-Oct-17 04:36 PM] TopHat888#8640
@WillRogerJones  Great stuff, Will! In this ecosystem with multiple players, the companies that shout  the loudest often get the attention. Undeserved or not, that's how it works. If you want Archain to be a plug-in everyone uses, you need to spend some dough on marketing. Glad you guys have settled in, and looking forward to following you into 2018 🏽


[04-Oct-17 04:29 AM] R0n#8093
what is the total supply


[04-Oct-17 04:29 AM] R0n#8093
?


[04-Oct-17 04:32 AM] R0n#8093
55 m ?


[04-Oct-17 06:00 AM] jon-archain#4445
@R0n , Indeed there are 55 million ARC tokens in total


[04-Oct-17 09:15 AM] Dandy#8330
I'll give you 20 dollars for the lot of them


[04-Oct-17 09:17 AM] jon-archain#4445
While your offer is, of course, tempting I think we'll decline it for now.


[04-Oct-17 09:56 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Haha, I am afraid so!


[04-Oct-17 10:54 AM] arweave-sam#9630

a little late migrating


[04-Oct-17 02:13 PM] jon-archain#4445
@information-corp  yes, discord has proved to be a much better platform so far


[04-Oct-17 03:25 PM] benjbrandall#1169
loving the Medium blog!


[04-Oct-17 05:29 PM] information-corp#0984
devs are there any important dates in October that we should be looking forward to? either specifically or in general?


[05-Oct-17 05:34 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hi @information-corp: We are scheduled to have our first developer hangout on the 12th, with our second update newsletter going out shortly afterward. We will also be talking about Archain on two podcasts this month, but I am not sure when those will be published publicly. Aside from that, you can always keep up to date with us on Twitter, Medium, or Github.


[05-Oct-17 06:32 AM] information-corp#0984
thank you @arweave-sam . i will look forward to everything


[06-Oct-17 05:31 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Us, too!

Last chance to pitch a question in the livestream!


[12-Oct-17 08:30 PM] information-corp#0984
hey guys i'm sorry i couldn't view the dev livestream today. i will watch it tonight. looks like you need to practice before going on air next time!  


[13-Oct-17 03:22 AM] operater#8595
Hi all


[13-Oct-17 03:25 AM] operater#8595
Glad to be here. Firsf time using discord, but hey, the interface really resembles the slack one. Doesn't the backend as well? So what's the advantage of discord ?


[13-Oct-17 03:29 AM] information-corp#0984
@operater  no scam direct message spam


[13-Oct-17 03:32 AM] operater#8595
Ah darn, missed the Livestream


[13-Oct-17 03:33 AM] operater#8595
Will the recording be available guys?


[13-Oct-17 03:33 AM] information-corp#0984
it's on youtube. i'm watching it now


[13-Oct-17 03:44 AM] operater#8595
A question for the team


[13-Oct-17 03:46 AM] operater#8595
Guys, could you please outline some reasons as to why aren't you burning unsold tokens?


[13-Oct-17 03:47 AM] operater#8595
Burning is the most common practice and the most fair one towards investors.


[13-Oct-17 03:49 AM] operater#8595
Is the unsold token distribution outlined in the terms/whitepaper


[13-Oct-17 03:49 AM] operater#8595
? Thanks


[16-Oct-17 12:16 AM] operater#8595
Hello?


[16-Oct-17 12:17 AM] operater#8595
3days and no word here. Is this channel dead ??


[16-Oct-17 04:13 AM] information-corp#0984
@operater the devs are usually not on during the weekend


[16-Oct-17 04:14 AM] information-corp#0984
they should answer you by Monday (U.K. time)


[16-Oct-17 04:15 AM] operater#8595
@information-corp good point :)


[16-Oct-17 04:15 AM] operater#8595
Still glad to hear someone's alive here,  


[16-Oct-17 04:24 AM] information-corp#0984
this place isn't too busy but the ico is still a few months away


[16-Oct-17 04:24 AM] information-corp#0984
when they start marketing and ramping up for ico there will be more traffic, i'm sure


[16-Oct-17 06:15 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Indeed, @information-corp


[16-Oct-17 06:16 AM] arweave-sam#9630
While also planning the next sale we are pretty heavily focussed on development right now


[16-Oct-17 06:17 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Lots of exciting stuff (although rather nerdy) happening there -- we are writing about it on the Archain Medium,

[16-Oct-17 06:19 AM]  #3138
Hey Sam, would you be able to tell me if worst comes to worst and not all tokens are sold during the ico, will you be burning the remaining tokens?


[16-Oct-17 06:19 AM] arweave-sam#9630
It was good thank you, I managed to get my first day off in... a long while! Excited tobe back.


[16-Oct-17 06:20 AM]  #3138
And have you guys hired any devs or is your whole team currently the one listed on your website?


[16-Oct-17 06:20 AM] information-corp#0984
cool man. i felt bad missing the livestream on thursday. just started to watch some on youtube. if you guys didn't get many viewers, don't be discouraged. it will pick up


[16-Oct-17 06:20 AM]  #3138
Yeah I'm sorry if these questions were answered in the live stream but I missed it


[16-Oct-17 06:20 AM] information-corp#0984
i'm definitely hoping to catch the next one


[16-Oct-17 06:21 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@  and @operater: We really need to see how the main sale goes before we can talk about that, but in the worst case scenario we will come to a solution that works for everyone in the community.


[16-Oct-17 06:21 AM] information-corp#0984
they will sell all of the tokens


[16-Oct-17 06:21 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@information-corp No problem at all -- looking forward to chatting with you at the next one!


[16-Oct-17 06:22 AM] information-corp#0984
 


[16-Oct-17 06:23 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We have been discussing potentially having two livestreams per month -- one for backers to ask questions etc, and another for Archain news for a more general audience. (No promises about that yet, just an idea we are discussing).


[16-Oct-17 06:23 AM] information-corp#0984
that sounds like a good idea


[16-Oct-17 06:23 AM] information-corp#0984
the more publicity you can give the better


[16-Oct-17 06:24 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Absolutely


[16-Oct-17 06:24 AM]  #3138
@arweave-sam thanks  🏼


[16-Oct-17 06:24 AM] arweave-sam#9630
No prbolem at all!


[16-Oct-17 06:24 AM] information-corp#0984
when the time comes, you may want to look at trying to get interviews on some of the popular youtube crypto channels


[16-Oct-17 06:26 AM] information-corp#0984
the blockweave man. it's going to be big


[16-Oct-17 06:26 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Definitely


[16-Oct-17 06:26 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We are actually talking to one group about going on their podcast already


[16-Oct-17 06:27 AM] arweave-sam#9630
And another, more niche, programming podcast reached out to us too


[16-Oct-17 06:27 AM] information-corp#0984
really cool. can't wait to hear


[16-Oct-17 06:27 AM] information-corp#0984
do you have any more info about when the yellow paper will be out?


[16-Oct-17 06:28 AM]  #3138
I feel like universities could employ archain technology in quite a few methods.


[16-Oct-17 06:30 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@information-corp: Not specifically, but we are using the Medium posts as a way of drafting much of the eventual content for the yellow paper


[16-Oct-17 06:30 AM] arweave-sam#9630
So if you want a sneak peak of at the contents, there is a good place to look!


[16-Oct-17 06:31 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@ : Completely. We are particularly interested in it as a system of permanent academic referencing


[16-Oct-17 06:31 AM] information-corp#0984
cool. right on, thanks sam


[16-Oct-17 06:32 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The system they use at the moment (just stating when a web page was accessed) is far from ideal.


[16-Oct-17 06:32 AM] arweave-sam#9630
There is no real way of tracing the knowledge back through that system, which was the point of referencing in the first place.


[16-Oct-17 06:33 AM] operater#8595
@arweave-sam thanks. Good to hear that there'll be options on the table.


[16-Oct-17 06:36 AM]  #3138
If I were to enquire with my friend who works in the IT department of my university, I could ask if they'd be willing to try out archain when the API suite comes out and the network launches, if the university agreed it could definitely be a good example for the public of the use case of your project


[16-Oct-17 06:36 AM]  #3138
It's a big if but I know my uni is always trying to be on the forefront of new tech


[16-Oct-17 06:37 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@ : That sounds great! If they were interested, we would be happy to work with them personally to set the system up.


[16-Oct-17 06:38 AM]  #3138
I'll enquire tomorrow so that they can have time to think it over and my friend can work on a pitch to his coworkers and their superiors  🏼

It would be my pleasure, not enough people appreciate or even understand the real word use of blockchain technologies. If I'm invested in something heavily I think it's only fair I do my part to spread the word.

hey guys


[16-Oct-17 05:05 PM] loferbart#1688
i have some questions about this project hoping to get answered here


[16-Oct-17 05:06 PM] loferbart#1688
is this mineable? if so, when will mining start? I know some projects start mining before coin even hits exchanges so im wondering if that is the case with this coin


[16-Oct-17 05:06 PM] loferbart#1688
thanks


[17-Oct-17 12:47 AM] mrwagner#6108
hello - it will be mine-able  not too sure when though but test-net will launch soon


[17-Oct-17 01:28 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Hi @loferbart! @mrwagner (as ever) is absolutely right. The blockweave will be mineable when the network launches -- we hope you take part!


[17-Oct-17 11:31 PM] loferbart#1688
i want to be ready for the genesis block? or is it genesis weave? lol


[17-Oct-17 11:31 PM] loferbart#1688
what algo will it use?


[18-Oct-17 06:08 AM] jon-archain#4445
@loferbart  It's a weave of blocks   The genesis block is just the first block! We'll be writing a blogpost soon to help you fully prepare for mining.


[18-Oct-17 10:04 AM] loferbart#1688
thanks!


[18-Oct-17 12:06 PM] jon-archain#4445
@loferbart  No problem!

[18-Oct-17 03:01 PM] Mimi#1207
Can anyone support me please?


[18-Oct-17 03:02 PM] Mimi#1207
I bought arc token while ago but I don't know where can I get my token


[18-Oct-17 03:08 PM] mrwagner#6108
when the network launches sir


[18-Oct-17 03:09 PM] Mimi#1207
Oh I see. Thanks  


[18-Oct-17 03:09 PM] mrwagner#6108

interesting project you have here


[19-Oct-17 03:51 AM] Dann#7704
Ah the real genuis comes from Sam and Will, if you have any meaty questions they've got the answers. Sam concepted the idea while ascending a mountain!

[19-Oct-17 03:55 AM] cromulon#5411
i had a quick read through the whitepaper earlier today and it looked great! But i will have a read through again before asking more questions.


[19-Oct-17 03:58 AM] cromulon#5411
Is Sam and the rest of the team working out of the UK?


[19-Oct-17 03:59 AM] jon-archain#4445
@cromulon  Archain is currently working out of Canterbury, UK.


[19-Oct-17 03:59 AM] cromulon#5411
ok thanks


[19-Oct-17 04:03 AM] cromulon#5411
Hi Jon


[19-Oct-17 04:04 AM] cromulon#5411
Break times over for me but before i go  is discord the most active social media platform for updates?


[19-Oct-17 04:06 AM] jon-archain#4445
Hi Rush. It depends what you are after. For a quick response or chat with someone on the team you can check discord. However, we also regularly update twitter, reddit and facebook with Archain on the web, medium blogposts and other things of interest.


[19-Oct-17 04:06 AM] jon-archain#4445
In terms of activity, you'll have fastest communication here but more content on, say, Twitter.


[19-Oct-17 04:08 AM] cromulon#5411
ok thanks, i'll make sure i check twitter etc...


[19-Oct-17 04:09 AM] cromulon#5411
there is one question i have though . Do you know when the next token release will be?

pretty sweet blog post jon


[21-Oct-17 03:56 PM] mrwagner#6108
I am aware of the lavabit incident, would like to see where archain messenger is headed @jon-archain


[21-Oct-17 04:00 PM] mrwagner#6108
Check out obsidian platform they are trying to do secure blockchain messaging but so far only have a fork of stratis and a  alpha of a standalone centralised messaging app...  this is why I like archain, the blockweave is already developed and has so many potential use cases


[23-Oct-17 12:03 PM] jon-archain#4445
@mrwagner  Thanks, 5till. I'm glad you enjoyed it. I'll take a look at obsidian.


[24-Oct-17 04:35 PM] mrwagner#6108
funny thing, they are UK based too


[28-Oct-17 12:25 AM] information-corp#0984
hey guys, nice to see the latest blog updates. keep up the good work


[28-Oct-17 12:25 AM] information-corp#0984
just checking in to see how development is progressing and if you have a timetable for marketing as you get closer to the ico?


[28-Oct-17 12:25 AM] information-corp#0984
thanks


[28-Oct-17 07:38 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Thanks, we're glad you like the blogs


[28-Oct-17 07:38 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Development is going pretty well, we set a pretty aggressive schedule for gettings things done and we're actually running a few days ahead of it at the moment


[28-Oct-17 07:40 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Marketing-wise, we've got a few things in the works as well as the usual


[28-Oct-17 07:40 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Keep an eye on the newsletters! We should have some pretty interesting stuff for the next two


[28-Oct-17 10:14 AM] Puck342#3354
I am very interested in the next news letter if it tells us what the eventual coin code of Archain is going to be


[28-Oct-17 10:15 AM] Puck342#3354
(ARC) being an unfortunately crowded area in terms of names already


[28-Oct-17 10:15 AM] Puck342#3354
personally i figured (ACH) would work


[29-Oct-17 06:37 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hi @Puck342: You should actually be hearing something about that very soon! Watch your inbox and here on Discord.


[29-Oct-17 06:47 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@information-corp: Further to what @WillRogerJones said, we are actually a number of weeks ahead of the development schedule. We need to do a little more internal testing,  but I would be surprised if we didn't release the alpha test network in the next few weeks (the original plan was late to release it in late December) -- no promises yet, though!

In terms of marketing, we will be starting to send out press releases, blogs, and talking to journalists regarding two of our new marketing projects in the next week or so. One of these projects that we hope will bring further attention to Archain is the app competition mentioned in @archain-jon's blog on Friday, the final details of the other one need to be finalised before its announcement, but we are very excited about it.


[29-Oct-17 06:51 AM] information-corp#0984
thanks Will and Sam. great news


[29-Oct-17 06:51 AM] information-corp#0984

[29-Oct-17 06:52 AM] arweave-sam#9630

[29-Oct-17 06:52 AM] information-corp#0984

[29-Oct-17 06:56 AM] information-corp#0984
weeks ahead of schedule. that is rare and refreshing to hear in the crypto world too


[29-Oct-17 06:59 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We have been a little surprised at how hitch-free development has gone so far, too. There is always the possibility of something unexpected coming up, but it is looking very positive at the moment.


[29-Oct-17 07:00 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I think using Erlang has really helped us move quickly in that regard


[29-Oct-17 07:00 AM] arweave-sam#9630
If we had built the server code in C/C++, it would have taken many fold longer.


[29-Oct-17 07:02 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The testing framework has also been extremely helpful.


[29-Oct-17 07:02 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Got to run now though, nice to chat @information-corp!


[29-Oct-17 08:33 AM] information-corp#0984
you too thanks @arweave-sam

Just wanted to officially introduce two of our new developers, archain-jon and archain-damon as wel as our new CCO, archain-india


[30-Oct-17 02:32 PM] WillRogerJones#8527
Jon and Damon are here to help us with development work, while India is going to be keeping us organised with Dans help


[30-Oct-17 02:33 PM] WillRogerJones#8527
Also, since a couple of you have asked to see out office, here is a picture both of our wonderful office and our new devs taking a quick break from working at Archains code :p

[30-Oct-17 04:52 PM] information-corp#0984
are you guys worried you may be associated with bitcoin cash?


[30-Oct-17 04:52 PM] information-corp#0984
bitcoin cash will probably fail fwiw


[30-Oct-17 04:52 PM] Patziggy#9371
Hello all! I have a question about the change to Ar.cash


[30-Oct-17 04:53 PM] Patziggy#9371
Will we be recieving Arc tokens or Ar.cash at the erc-20 address we provided during the crowdsale, and are there any steps I should take to make sure these tokens are visible in my wallet?


[30-Oct-17 04:56 PM] information-corp#0984
have to admit that i am not opposed to rebranding. but i find the current logo and archain name to be superior


[30-Oct-17 05:56 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Hi @information-corp: Please can you expand on your Bitcoin Cash comment? We are not associated with them. If you are referring to the new token name, we think that '.cash' domains will likely to become quite popular in the cryptocurrency space (see z.cash, for example).

We don't see it so much as full re-branding as renaming a sub-component of the project (the token) -- it is still very much 'the Archain project'.

@Patziggy: We do not currently plan to issue an ERC-20 token for ar.cash, the tokens will be transferable once the main net is live in March 2018.


[30-Oct-17 06:08 PM] information-corp#0984
hi sam. i guess i am not opposed to .cash if you believe they will become more popular. my thinking was that, at the moment, they are quite limited in number, and if something like bitcoin cash turns out to be a failure, the cash moniker may garner a negative connotation by association.


[30-Oct-17 06:11 PM] information-corp#0984
if the renaming is limited to just the token and does not affect the "Archain" brand itself (marketing, website, etc.) then my concerns are much less. we really like Archain


[30-Oct-17 06:12 PM] information-corp#0984
however, have you considered a ticker symbol longer than 3 letters? Dash, IOTA, COSS, are some examples i can think of right off the top of my head


[30-Oct-17 06:13 PM] information-corp#0984
ACHN or ARCN or ARCHN would have been my preference, but just one man's opinion


[30-Oct-17 06:26 PM] lungov#3562
hi guys! it's great to be in the community

may I ask if the project is still Archain, why is the site moving to ar.cash?


[30-Oct-17 06:33 PM] information-corp#0984
i think .cash also suggests monetary and value transfer emphasis, whereas Archain's raison d'etre seems to be more in line with permanent data storage, (transmission?), scalability, etc.


[30-Oct-17 06:34 PM] information-corp#0984
personally, i think Archain and Blockweave are A+++++++. and i could do without the cash emphasis unless it's just related to the token, which is of lesser importance


[30-Oct-17 06:35 PM] information-corp#0984
i know you guys think long and hard about these things and put your ideas and heart and soul out there in such a public manner that invites both praise and criticism. good suggestions and bad ones! kudos for being so open to that!


[30-Oct-17 06:36 PM] information-corp#0984
keep up the good work devs

Archain has a very strong bond with the word archive, so I like it a lot. But of course there are a lot of things to consider. Your work has been awesome, I'm just trying to throw some more thoughts in!


[30-Oct-17 08:58 PM] information-corp#0984
anothing thing to consider @arweave-sam, referencing your z.cash example, is that ar.cash might seem derivative, or get lost in the mix if several of those type names pop up


[30-Oct-17 09:00 PM] information-corp#0984
whereas Archain really stands out from a brand perspective, and as @lungov noted, it's more connected linguistically to what you guys are really trying to do


[30-Oct-17 09:01 PM] information-corp#0984
if it's just the token i'm not as concerned, because that's of lesser importance, but i would be more worried about the changing of the website, rebrand, etc. because it seems to be a different direction than what the project is really about


[31-Oct-17 02:51 AM] mrwagner#6108
Option 5 logo should feature a pirate silhouette...it is arrr cash after all

[31-Oct-17 02:54 AM] mrwagner#6108
@information-corp zcash existed long before bch, I don't think bch failure will impact  ar.cash or zec as an example


[31-Oct-17 02:56 AM] information-corp#0984
hi @mrwagner


[31-Oct-17 02:57 AM] information-corp#0984
yeah i think my first reply to sam was not as coherent as my second reply


[31-Oct-17 02:57 AM] information-corp#0984
i think our bigger concern would be the derivative financialization of archain that could lose the product in mix of other crypto projects


[31-Oct-17 02:58 AM] information-corp#0984
we're just not sure how the .cash moniker fits in with what Archain is doing and its brand and everything


[31-Oct-17 02:58 AM] information-corp#0984
whereas z.cash is all about value transfer


[31-Oct-17 02:59 AM] information-corp#0984
it's kind of apples and oranges, in our opinion


[31-Oct-17 03:05 AM] mrwagner#6108
   ..tbh..i was a little confused by the domain being spun up for the token/currency


[31-Oct-17 03:06 AM] mrwagner#6108
would you propose a poll on the currency name?


[31-Oct-17 03:07 AM] information-corp#0984
what do you mean?


[31-Oct-17 03:09 AM] mrwagner#6108
a community poll on currency name suggestions other than ar.cash?


[31-Oct-17 03:11 AM] information-corp#0984
oh, sure. i support the devs asking for any and all feedback. including opinions different from mine


[31-Oct-17 03:12 AM] information-corp#0984
my preference would be ARCHN or ACHN or ARCN something like that


[31-Oct-17 03:12 AM] information-corp#0984
but if the rebrand is simply limited to the token, while the website and marketing and brand name and everything else remains "Archain". we are less concerned


[31-Oct-17 03:28 AM] information-corp#0984
also, welcome to the new devs. @joannaz. @jon-archain. @arweave-india. @arweave-damon. if we haven't seen you here before


[31-Oct-17 07:40 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Thanks for all the feedback guys, it's super helpful.

Yeah, to clarify, this is simply a renaming of the currency part of Archain, we just wanted to make sure the currency has it's own identity -- archive cash to go with the archiving chain. Over the long and very-long term, though, we wanted to highlight the association between the data archived on the weave, and the tokens.

We're still exactly as committed to the ideals of our project as before. We're not changing anything about how Archain will work or what we want to achieve.

Regarding the website: we're looking to update it a little, but it will still very much be the archain project. Both domains will point to the homepage of the Archain project, we just prefer ar.cash due to length/snappiness.

All the best,
Sam + Will


[31-Oct-17 10:01 AM] mrwagner#6108
thanks guys


[31-Oct-17 10:03 AM] mrwagner#6108
so the ar.cash implies currency, any other  ar[token] will have it's own place in the ecosystem in the long term? like side chain/weave?


[31-Oct-17 10:49 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hi @mrwagner, we don't envision that there will be any other tokens in the ecosystem, at least for the time being. ar.cash is just the token that you use on the Archain network :-).


[31-Oct-17 10:52 AM] mrwagner#6108
great thanks!


[31-Oct-17 11:00 AM] operater#8595
@arweave-sam hi Sam


[31-Oct-17 11:02 AM] operater#8595
in your announcement you confirm that you are only renaming the currency yet you will be redirecting archain.org to ar.cash


[31-Oct-17 11:02 AM] operater#8595
right ?


[31-Oct-17 11:04 AM] operater#8595
quote "You’ll still be able to find the project at archain.org but we will also be rebasing to https://ar.cash as our new home on the web. We have also invited our backers to take part in a poll to decide our new ar.cash logo."


[31-Oct-17 11:08 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hi @operator, yes, that is the plan at the moment. We like the length of the ar.cash URL, but both both domains will still work.


[31-Oct-17 11:08 AM] operater#8595
ok, but, "We will also be moving our homepage, in line with this change, to https://ar.cash. Once the change has taken place, Archain.org will redirect you to this address."


[31-Oct-17 11:08 AM] operater#8595
you say in the email that the ar.cash will be redirected to archain.org


[31-Oct-17 11:09 AM] operater#8595
I am a little bit concerned as to why are you changing the entire project homepage if it is only the currency that is getting a rebrand ?


[31-Oct-17 11:10 AM] operater#8595
and what would be the reasons for changing the logo design ?


[31-Oct-17 11:15 AM] operater#8595
I cannot help myself but to look at this as an entire project rebrand. I really hope I'm wrong, am I missing something ?


[31-Oct-17 11:16 AM] operater#8595
some of us have backed the project with more substantial amounts of money and those sudden changes without any explanation sound like a concern


[31-Oct-17 11:19 AM] lungov#3562
as much as I am excited about the project, and as much as I understand that it's impossible for everyone to agree on every little thing, @operater 's concerns are mine too; the new URL isnt that much shorter, and the logo should imho be for the project, not for the token; so I dont understand those changes


[31-Oct-17 11:26 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@operater: We perfectly understand your concerns, but this is not a full project rebranding -- we simply needed a different name for the token as there were a number of other tokens using the 'ARC' symbol, which was causing unnecessary confusion. We think that a shorter token name, and memorable web address, will work best in the long-term. Regarding whether ar.cash redirects to archain.org, or the other way around: this is very useful feedback that we will take on-board. We will definitely talk about this internally once we have gathered all the feedback from the community.


[31-Oct-17 11:30 AM] operater#8595
@arweave-sam  it is still unclear as to why is the logo changing ?


[31-Oct-17 11:31 AM] operater#8595
and as for the domain .org represented your ideals perfectly.  Combatting censorship and creating the history for the internet


[31-Oct-17 11:32 AM] operater#8595
this is what inspired many of us in the first place, the cause


[31-Oct-17 11:33 AM] operater#8595
.cash does not represent your project and/or your original ideals


[31-Oct-17 12:03 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We received a significant amount of negative feedback regarding the logo during the pre-sale periods, and we are not much fans of it ourselves. We thought that now, along with the token name change, would be the right time to broach that problem.

We are sorry that you feel that the .cash domain does not represent the ideals of the project. We can absolutely assure you that our ideals have not changed in the slightest. We are still just as commited to building a permanent store of human history (for which, development is far ahead of schedule).


[31-Oct-17 12:43 PM] operater#8595
as your backer I am really glad that you are valuing our opinions and that you will consider the impact of changing your homepage domain on archain ideology.


[31-Oct-17 12:46 PM] information-corp#0984
i too respect that you guys (and gals!) listen to feedback during pre-sale and now. you are very bright people and will have to decide what's best for Archain, and i know you will receive every sort of different opinion on every detail you propose


[31-Oct-17 12:47 PM] information-corp#0984
we also share the same concerns however as @operater, @lungov, perhaps @mrwagner and others


[31-Oct-17 12:47 PM] information-corp#0984
we don't understand the connection between .cash and what Archain is all about


[31-Oct-17 12:48 PM] information-corp#0984
.cash from a brand perspective implies value transfer. a project built around people sending each other money. and this seems far removed from Archain's goal. ultimately, we think it is a mistake


[31-Oct-17 12:49 PM] information-corp#0984
but i will yield and allow other people to voice their opinions


[31-Oct-17 12:50 PM] operater#8595
I absolutely agree, I am so glad that community shares those concerns. but you guys should know that by expressing concerns we also express the original enthousiasm we all have regarding the project.


[31-Oct-17 12:52 PM] operater#8595
The idea of the permanet for the internet and what a great impact would it have on the future of humanity. Personally I envisioned archain as the synonym for immutable history of mankind


[31-Oct-17 12:53 PM] operater#8595
.cash in my opinion has no place in a revolutionary vocabulary. Cash reminds of our current, soon to be obsolete monetary system, hell, cash is already obsolete


[31-Oct-17 12:53 PM] information-corp#0984
we support that too! but also see other uses for Archain. the potential is immense


[31-Oct-17 12:54 PM] operater#8595
yes, it's just an example of course.


[31-Oct-17 12:54 PM] information-corp#0984
a fine example yes


[31-Oct-17 12:55 PM] operater#8595
also, another issue is that many altcoins nowdays are associating cash to their name. it is reminiscent of Bitcoin Cash for example


[31-Oct-17 12:58 PM] operater#8595
this is also a real concern because associating yourself to this cash suffix will be weakening  / diluting your brand.


[31-Oct-17 01:00 PM] operater#8595
All in all, I still think that ar.cash is a great idea for representing ARC tokens. But should definitely not replace the archain brand, and or the homepage


[31-Oct-17 01:01 PM] operater#8595
and we could have a poll regarding this. it would be great


[31-Oct-17 01:01 PM] arweave-sam#9630
That is how we see it, too, @operater.

ar.cash is just the name of the token, which needed to change from ARC due to naming collisions with other projects. While we agree on the direction of cash in society, we think that it is still a better word than 'token'. We also expect that it's semantic meaning will change over time -- in the same way that 'directory' now refers to a computing concept, rather than its initial 'real-world' meaning.

It seems that most of the issue here is based around the move of the homepage from archain.org to ar.cash. While we cannot make a decision about that immediately, we have certainly taken these thoughts on-board.


[31-Oct-17 01:01 PM] lungov#3562
I agree entirely. I am of course still very much on board, and very excited for everything that's coming. But it is hard not to think of all these changes as a re-brand, especially when the project logo reads the name of the token, not the name of the project itself. It looks like everything else will be put under the token.


[31-Oct-17 01:02 PM] mrwagner#6108
Agreed @operater  and @information-corp


[31-Oct-17 01:04 PM] information-corp#0984
@arweave-sam i find your responses in here encouraging also. just want to give you a thumbs up for the way you handle all of the feedback


[31-Oct-17 01:05 PM] information-corp#0984
being a diplomat would seem like such an obvious part of your job description, but it's shocking how little patience some devs and CEOs have in crypto


[31-Oct-17 01:09 PM] lungov#3562
Just one last suggestion regarding the homepage issue, which one should redirect to the other. You could have a page for the token and a page for the project. https://ar.cash could have info on quotes, price history, transactions, etc sort of like blockchain.info. And then you could have https://archain.org with info about the project as a whole, the API, all the possibilities, the team, etc. Just one possibility to consider.


[31-Oct-17 01:19 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@information-corp: Thanks, I appreciate the feedback!

@lungov: Interestingly, that was something we were talking about earlier, and is certainly on the cards. Ideas for features of an alternative ar.cash site (for example, AR volume transfer over-time, perhaps?) would be most welcome. What kinds of stats/information do you think would be most interesting to display? The site, in fact, could simply run as an Archain ADT app on the network.


[31-Oct-17 01:45 PM] lungov#3562
@arweave-sam , what stats/information you could display at the ar.cash site depends on things I still don't know about the project. I thought it could be something like https://blockchain.info/. But anyways, I'm happy the idea is being considered as I believe it would satisfy all the concerns brought here by everyone, at least regarding the project's domain. Keep up the excellent work! I'm really glad to be here.


[31-Oct-17 01:56 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Indeed, @lungov. We were thinking it could be a kind of 'blockchain.info++' system. We are interested to see which ways we could improve on the blockchain explorer idea, particularly in the context of a blockweave based system.

No promises at this point, but things are looking positive for that solution here in the office, too.


[05-Nov-17 11:40 PM] HiteshB#8784
is ar.cash down?

Hi


[09-Nov-17 08:55 AM] operater#8595
anyone knows what backers are eligible for the mining program ?


[09-Nov-17 09:25 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hi @operater  - those that purchased the developer package and above will be issued keys for use on the test network in the next couple of weeks


[13-Nov-17 01:03 AM] Simon#7927
Hi guys, when do you think is the wallet ready?


[13-Nov-17 01:10 PM] arweave-india#5075
Hi Simon- the first client (allowing you to spend and transfer your AR) for the Archain system will be the web extension, which is in alpha now. The full extension and mining software will be released in March 2018.


[14-Nov-17 01:49 AM] Simon#7927
@arweave-india  thank you very much! great support!

@arweave-india hello


[16-Nov-17 11:09 AM] operater#8595
Guys, you said that we will be getting keys for the test network and mining in a couple of weeks


[16-Nov-17 11:09 AM] operater#8595
my question is


[16-Nov-17 11:09 AM] operater#8595
why some people already have access to mining


[16-Nov-17 11:10 AM] operater#8595
Mike - Last Monday at 3:25 PM
If it might be helpful, here is the output from when I initiate the mining command:

[16-Nov-17 11:10 AM] operater#8595
can you hand out some instruction on how could we try and mine ourselves


[16-Nov-17 11:10 AM] operater#8595
?


[16-Nov-17 11:14 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hi @operater 

I would recommend taking a look at our blog post (containing instructions on how to begin test-mining on the test network) here - https://medium.com/@archain/the-archain-backer-alpha-test-network-is-live-130a0a1dec11

Hopefully that's of help!

[16-Nov-17 11:16 AM] operater#8595
as for your medium post


[16-Nov-17 11:16 AM] operater#8595
there is an issue


[16-Nov-17 11:16 AM] operater#8595
"Eligible backers have been provided with details of the initial node IP address via email."


[16-Nov-17 11:16 AM] operater#8595
I was not provided those


[16-Nov-17 11:18 AM] operater#8595
by the way guys, if we want the project to stand out, we should try launching the mainnet ASAP


[16-Nov-17 11:18 AM] operater#8595
as well as ICOs


[16-Nov-17 11:18 AM] operater#8595
there are more and more ICO's out there


[16-Nov-17 11:19 AM] arweave-india#5075
We're aiming to begin the next sale period  towards the end of this year/beginning of next year. Look out for a blog post about this in the next couple of weeks!

As for the email, we're sorry to hear that. Please PM me your email address and I will re-sent the email to you right away.

wait what's this? "Eligible backers have been provided with details of the initial node IP address via email." does that just mean my Archain Private Key? cuz i did get thhat


[16-Nov-17 02:26 PM] Puck342#3354
but i didn't get anything that looked like an IP address


[16-Nov-17 02:32 PM] arweave-india#5075
Hi @Puck342 - No problem! The IP address was provided within the email sent out on 7th November (subject line: 'Archain Update: New Logo, Backer Test Network Live, App Competition and more!'). If you didn't get that email or can't locate it now for any reason, please drop me a private message with your email address and I'll re-send the email to you, and investigate why you may not have received the first attempt.


[16-Nov-17 02:36 PM] Puck342#3354

do we have any instructions on how to start mining ? what algo is used ? etc


[27-Nov-17 10:33 AM] jon-archain#4445
did you launch with the `mine' param?


[27-Nov-17 12:05 PM] operater#8595
hi jon


[27-Nov-17 12:05 PM] operater#8595
no


[27-Nov-17 12:06 PM] operater#8595
I just launched the automated script on that was provided on BATN.2 announcement


[27-Nov-17 12:07 PM] operater#8595
where can I get the manual ?


[27-Nov-17 12:08 PM] jon-archain#4445
all the documentation is provided on our github. May I ask how long you have been waiting to mine a block? Depending on transaction size (if someone is archiving something large) or difficulty, it could take some time to mine a block.


[27-Nov-17 12:09 PM] jon-archain#4445
You can see some documentation here

I think it was supposed to be in December according to their first livestream, but might be in January too I guess. Looking forward to following this very important project in the years to come!

Hi Kalifed, Astoshi,

We actually have some extremely exciting news about this, but unfortunately we can't talk about it publically right now due to confidentiality agreements. This development will enhance the prospects and backing for the project dramatically(!), and in turn greatly benefit our pre-sale backers. As much as we would love to talk about it now, we will have to wait for the week beginning 22/1/18. Stay tuned -- can't wait to discuss it with you all then!

All the best,
Sam + Will

In other news, the second major first-party app for the Archain (test) network is nearly ready! The app is a simple, no fuss, permanent file backup mechanism. We are hoping that apps like these (offering clear, direct value to those outside the cryptocurrency community) will help drive wide adoption and showcase the Archain as a practical app platform.

@arweave-damon is just finishing off the UI styling now. Keep posted to the blog (and # tech-announcements channel) for details!


[09-Dec-17 08:52 AM] jazz010#3197

Hey, can I get a link to the Firefox extension for archive queuing?

Congratulations on the exciting news, also! Can't wait to hear about it.

Hi @jazz010: As soon as the network has launched we will be listed on exchanges.


[11-Dec-17 03:09 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Hey @benjbrandall, how's it going?

I am afraid the Firefox versions of the extension aren't ready yet. @arweave-damon still needs to work out some styling problems on Firefox.


[11-Dec-17 03:09 PM] jazz010#3197

it's just  also that it would feel nice to have them stored in a wallet, where you can move them around if we want

Is the wallet working now?


[11-Dec-17 03:24 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Hi guys, we will be releasing the information about the main sale in January. We wish we could let you know the details sooner, but for contractual reasons (regarding the people that we are working with) we can't talk about it until then. We know this is frustrating, but we are confident that it will be worth the wait. This development should significantly increase visibility of the project (increasing growth, demand and therefore value for all our backers). Unfortunately, due to the terms of our contracts, there is just nothing more we can say about it until then.

Hi @Piccalo, we are pronouncing it with a hard 'R' (as in 'archive') followed by 'chain'.

[11-Dec-17 04:24 PM] Piccalo#5124
Very clean, thanks for clearing up the naming. If I think of anything for the Archivelt I'll let you know   It's tough since it is an archive by definition but it's special since it's an archive using archain but now we're archarchive and now I've confused myself. cheers


[11-Dec-17 10:55 PM] vimal.s08#6053
Hey guys,

Just wanted to share a thought on the latest medium post. I'm not sure if the initial paragraph in which you guys belittled ethereum was the best strategic move. 

I feel that there are fervent believers in several of these cryptocurrencies... And by doing this some of these people may grow sour towards archain, irrespective of it's usefulness. Would love to hear everyone's thoughts here. 

Also... Excellent discussion on the secret cave podcast.


[12-Dec-17 05:34 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Interesting point, vimal. Thanks for the feedback!

We do firmly beleive that


[12-Dec-17 05:35 AM] arweave-sam#9630
*a lack of a killer app on the Ethereum platform is an ominous sign (talking as someone with a significant amount of ETH). We will certainly adjust the tone in the future though.

@mec1988 @Marcin There is already a project called Rchain. Will cause massive confusion to keep Archain, as the pronounciation is the exact same.

I agree - we should keep the initial logo - however the name should be changed for sure

General question to mining: is archain mining sha-256 or scrypt-mining? Or maybe something different? I have some old usb miner (antminer used for bitcoin long time ago) and was wondering, if i bring them back to life to use them for archain.


[21-Dec-17 07:12 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Archain currently uses sha256, but we are considering some alternatives, too.


[21-Dec-17 07:14 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We will confirm the hashing alg for the PoW long before main net launch though, to make sure people have time to prepare their mining setups.


[21-Dec-17 11:58 AM] Marcin#0065
scrypt mining would be awesome, a lot scrypt miners are around with better efficeny  


[23-Dec-17 06:44 AM] arweave-sam#9630
One of the main considerations regarding hashing algorithm choice is whether the specialised hardware for it is concentrated in a single geographic location. For example, IIRC ~80% of the world's sha-256 specialised mining hardware is found in China. For a project like ours, one country having >50% of the hashing power should be avoided if at all possible.

Another concern is longevity. We want the Archain (in its current form) to run for potentially hundreds of years. While that means that the hashing algorithm will very likely be broken and have to be replaced at some point, we want to go as long as we can before that becomes necessary.

One of the options we have been looking at is the Cuckoo Cycle algorithm. CC is bottlenecked by memory bandwidth (rather than computation), making it extremely difficult for one country to gain a monopoly over the 'means of consensus'. It is also based on finding cycles in directed graphs, which has been extremely well studied (making breaks in the algorithm unlikely for a while).

A side note about the Cuckoo Cycle is that it would allow non-trivial amounts of mining to be done on phones, laptops, and other low energy devices.

That is where we are internally regarding hashing algortihms. Comments always welcome :-).


[23-Dec-17 07:08 AM] Marcin#0065
Sounds really nice   i believe you will choose the best choice for your project. I didnt know china was that big in mining  


[23-Dec-17 07:11 AM] Marcin#0065
Does it make any sense to run multiple algorithms? (Like dash) and regulate fairly and flexible the amount being mined on each algorithm? In case of a broken one, there will be alternatives. Also you would reach more miners. But as i dont know much i dont know if that is even possible

You dont get an ether adress if you invested. So i guess, you will not see any token in MEW


[24-Dec-17 06:20 AM] coinangel#9202
Then the tokens are not released yet, how to check on my balance? Is there a log-in site for that?


[24-Dec-17 06:56 AM] Marcin#0065
If you have invested in pre sale, you should have got an internet page afterwards. On the site you had you public key and priv key

@Marcin#0065 Wow, ur a patient guy 🏽


[24-Dec-17 07:02 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Hi @coinangel, @Marcin is exactly right. If you can't find the email with the link to your order page let us know by sending an email to 'team@archain.org' and we will help you out.

You also need to download your test net key file from that page in order to use the web extension, so perhaps that is why it did not work for you.

I always thought erlang/ elixir would be great for this tech as is designed to be distributed. And is really amazing to see that  a lot less code that in Java for example can make amazing things.


[06-Jan-18 03:45 PM] tierralibre#2740
is it related to: ar_gossip.erl ln 71


[06-Jan-18 04:40 PM] tierralibre#2740
or ar_router.erl


[07-Jan-18 02:57 AM] information-corp#0984
hello devs, any more news on ico? do we have a specific date yet for the late January announcement?


[07-Jan-18 02:58 AM] information-corp#0984
what is going on in the crypto market right now will not last much longer. strike while the iron is hot, as they say


[07-Jan-18 02:58 AM] information-corp#0984
i'm hoping this means there is already a sell-out. wow wouldn't that be something


[07-Jan-18 06:18 PM] crypto#5987
Hi all, what's the total coin supply?


[07-Jan-18 06:28 PM] mec1988#6670
55m, I believe.  But that could be incorrect information from coinschedule.com


[07-Jan-18 08:50 PM] crypto#5987
Where can I buy Archain from?


[07-Jan-18 09:11 PM] mec1988#6670
They are not for sale at the moment.  All contributors at this point do not have a way to move them.  They're basically reservations.


[07-Jan-18 09:12 PM] mec1988#6670
Which is probably a good thing.


[07-Jan-18 09:13 PM] crypto#5987
Thanks


[07-Jan-18 09:15 PM] mec1988#6670
This project is the first mover on this.  The crux of this project will only become more important over time.


[07-Jan-18 09:19 PM] mec1988#6670
Anyone around to share some insight on where we're at now and where we're headed in the short term?  Would love to see erc20 coins so that they could be traded on etherdelta early while we await major exchanges.  Sorry if this goes against stated plans.


[08-Jan-18 11:12 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hi all! We're just working through people's comments and queries from over the holidays at the moment, hopefully will be finished up by the end of today.

I hope everyone here had a lovely festive period!  


[08-Jan-18 11:16 AM] tierralibre#2740
Thank you!


[08-Jan-18 11:21 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hi @   - I would definitely recommend keeping an eye on a few places for important updates on the project's progress - particularly our Twitter account (@ArchainTeam), and our Medium blog (https://medium.com/@archain). Also any backers from the pre-sale should be receiving regular updates via email on our progress - if you haven't been getting any emails from us please do let me know as I will work to resolve that right away - you can just drop us an email (india@archain.org or team@archain.org), or a direct message here if that's easier.

As for specific development/tech point of view we're ahead of our dev targets - the targets are listed on the website of course, and detailed announcements are posted on our Medium blog as mentioned above when various milestones are reached.

As for specific business developments - as we have mentioned elsewhere previously, we have some truly *very* exciting news that we're simply not allowed to announce quite yet that I think you'll be very pleased with. The announcement will be going out this month, however! I'd recommend following us on Twitter to hear about that ASAP.

 
https://medium.com/@archain).
Not Found – Medium
We could not find what you were looking for on Medium.


[08-Jan-18 11:24 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hi @tierralibre - I will get one of our developers to answer your message passing questions ASAP!


[08-Jan-18 11:36 AM] arweave-india#5075
Several people have asked us for more specific information about the date of the main sale period and other upcoming events (including @Marcin , @information-corp , @  ), so I wanted to address this more generally

We will be releasing a fully detailed timeline including dates of all events (including the next token sale date!) once our very exciting announcement is made public in a couple of weeks' time. As I have mentioned before, we're contractually obliged not to state any details about that upcoming announcement right now, but it is very positive for the project (and the community) - I for one am really looking forward to talking to you all about it!


[08-Jan-18 11:41 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hi @information-corp ! Hope you're well.

In short, we now have confirmation that we can make this 'late January' announcement on the 22nd of Jan!


[08-Jan-18 12:05 PM] arweave-india#5075
Hello @crypto - @mec1988 is right, we're not currently in a token sale period. The next opportunity to purchase tokens will be during our main sale, the dates of which we'll be able to announce shortly after the 22nd of January.


[08-Jan-18 12:15 PM] arweave-india#5075
Hi @mec1988  - Due to Archain's unique scaling requirements, it is based on its own platform and so is not compatible with ERC20. Unfortunately of course this means that they're not yet tradeable (until they're listed on exchanges of course). As I've mentioned above in other replies, we'll be publishing a very detailed timeline soon which will give you an insight into the sale, exchanges, and main network release dates.

Also, thanks for answering others' questions before I did!  


[08-Jan-18 12:24 PM] mec1988#6670
That's great news.  Thank you.  Hope everyone is having a great start to this new year.  Cheers.

been waiting months to get in. Missed the presale by days.


[11-Jan-18 03:13 AM] cromulon#5411
Where did everyone go?


[11-Jan-18 04:33 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hi @cromulon - welcome! I suspect everyone here is scattered across lots of timezone, sometimes it's quite busy other times really quiet. Our team are usually around from morning to evening UK time, if you ever want to catch us on Discord to chat.


[11-Jan-18 05:15 AM] cromulon#5411
Hey. I remember now. Most of the team is UK based.


[11-Jan-18 05:26 AM] arweave-india#5075
Yep, that's right!


[12-Jan-18 01:19 AM] cromulon#5411
Any particulare reason sha-256 was chosen as the encryption method and not something else?


[12-Jan-18 01:20 AM] BBM#0001
I don't believe that SHA256 has been settled on completely yet.


[12-Jan-18 01:24 AM] cromulon#5411
is anything else still left to be confirmed , eg total supply?


[12-Jan-18 01:24 AM] cromulon#5411
i recall there was a decision to change the name to AR cash. Was this reversed?


[12-Jan-18 01:25 AM] BBM#0001
I'm unsure on total supply, but I think the name is still ARcash - probably a good move to stop confusion between Archain and Achain


[12-Jan-18 01:25 AM] cromulon#5411
thank you. Any reason why AR cash was chosen?


[12-Jan-18 01:28 AM] BBM#0001
I believe it was picked to indicate that ARcash is the currency aspect of Archain. The company, Archain, still exists, but the currency will be known as ARcash to make that distinction


[12-Jan-18 01:28 AM] BBM#0001
You'll need to wait for staff for more specific answers as I'm running low on the amount of detail left in my pot!

[12-Jan-18 02:31 AM] Marcin#0065
Algorithm is not chosen yet. Test network is on sha256. Thsy consider a memody bandwith depandent algorithm, cuckoo cycle was one idea. They will announce soon more i believe.


[12-Jan-18 02:31 AM] Marcin#0065

thanks~

They told the numbers somewhere. But i dont want to scroll to look for it xD


[12-Jan-18 11:53 AM] Puck342#3354
@cromulon thanks man, i like to think so  


[16-Jan-18 10:17 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hi all

Thanks @BBM and @Marcin#0065 for contributing - you guys are indeed correct (as usual! :D) - SHA-256 is being used for the test network. For the main network, we're exploring some interesting options for the Proof of Work component of the Proof of Access algorithm that would be memory-bound (ensuring a good geographic distribution of computing power)  and also involve constant re-verification of data in the network. It's important to stress though that these algorithms would be nested inside the wider Proof of Access system, so are not as integral as they are in other cryptocurrency systems. 

@cromulon  - the total supply of tokens is 55mil in the Genesis block, and I believe your other queries have been addressed here too, answered here by other very kind users! Let me know if there's anything else you're curious about.

@Soros | RealSatoshi - The total during the pre-sale we raised approximately $550k USD.

As always guys let me know any and all of your questions and comments, I'm always happy to help and chat  


[16-Jan-18 10:17 AM] arweave-india#5075
Sorry @Marcin I fluffed your username tagging in the response above - thanks for your assistance as always


[16-Jan-18 11:05 AM] Marcin#0065
Thank you :)
I believe you are working hard and i know it takes a lot of time to develop the project. Will there be a final test-network with the new algorithm before launch?  Any idea of how many tokens you want to sell in ico? (Will there be any ico sale?)


[16-Jan-18 11:26 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
@Marcin  Yes! The final few test networks will be using whichever algorithm we have finalised.  We will certainly have a second sale, details of which will be released a few weeks beforehand. Keep an eye on our twitter and medium blog.


[16-Jan-18 07:56 PM] Puck342#3354
and that twitter is [at]ArchainTeam right? or is there another account


[17-Jan-18 12:42 AM] arweave-india#5075
Yep @Puck342 that's the correct, it's [at]ArchainTeam


[21-Jan-18 01:46 AM] Marcin#0065
Im really exited for tomorrows news. Also ready for the ico.


[21-Jan-18 01:57 AM] Marcin#0065
@arweave-india if you want to promote your project on the german-speaking markets before the ico, i would recommend you to reach out for „tobg“. It is the most trustworthy guy on youtube from switzerland. His name is patrick and his channel is „tobg business“, and usually he explains stuff from stock markets. With all the crypto hype he started introduce people into that market with a calm and serious intention. He isnt doing many ico reviews (think two so far) but since you got such a serious project in your hands, i hope he would give his opinion to the archain project. Would be awesome to see him speak about archain. It would reach few thousands people from german speaking areas.

All,

Today I must sadly inform you of the passing of Jon Sherry, our dear friend and colleague, known here on Discord as archain-jon. Jon’s untimely accidental death comes as a tragic shock to the whole team, and is a loss keenly felt by all of us left behind, whether we knew him personally, professionally, or both. 

I know that Jon had much direct contact with the Archain Discord community, and will have directly helped many of you with your queries and support needs. Jon sincerely enjoyed collaborating with you all, and was so pleased with the growth of this community, and how enthusiastic, constructive, and friendly you all were.

We have posted a more detailed statement about Jon’s passing on the Archain Facebook page here (https://www.facebook.com/ArchainTeam/posts/308759356194943), but wanted to offer special thanks to you all, as Jon worked so closely with the Archain Discord community. 

With our sincere sympathy, 
Sam, Will, and the Archain team

Ur plans look ambitious. But also I wish you strength after the loss of your beloved friend. I dont know how youre doing all over there, but it sounds like a lot positive and a lot negative emotions mixed together. I probably couldnt handle it easy :/


[22-Jan-18 03:21 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Thanks, @Marcin, that pretty much sums it up. It is an exceptionally strange situation, nonetheless the team is handling it admirably.


[22-Jan-18 03:35 PM] Marcin#0065
I lost a family member not long ago. It will sound harsh, but time will make it easier to handle with. In my case it was the als disease, enough time to speak and understand what people start thinking with a given death sentence. Nevertheless it was a shock and hard emotions when the day came. I admire you for keeping on somehow.

That is awful, Marcin. I am so sorry for your loss. I will pass on your kind words to the rest of the team.

Hi all! 

Just wanted to mention, in case you hadn't noticed, we're still waiting on the public announcement from Techstars Berlin about their enrolled companies for 2018. We've all chatted about it in the offices here with the TS guys, and we know their announcement is coming up and there will be a significant PR push around it too, but we don't have a fixed date for that yet I'm afraid (I'm sure it will be very soon).

As always, we'll be sure to share any updates here on Discord with you guys, but in the meantime feel free to ask any questions you might have about our TS enrolment or anything else ofc

Hey @NQ


[13-Feb-18 04:17 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Yes! We're currently running a stable backer test network. Currently the test net is only availible to backers, but the next major version will be public.


[13-Feb-18 04:19 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Our closest competition is probably NXT, who are doing a very similar thing but without changing the blockchain data structure


[13-Feb-18 04:21 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
This forces them to limit TXs to 42kb each because they're stuck with all of the native blockchain scaling problems,something that isn't a problem to us

Substratum and Orchid are both super interesting projects for tacking internet freedom, but they come at the problem very differently to us


[13-Feb-18 04:24 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
The main difference comes once again from the scaling problems that limit them but not us


[13-Feb-18 04:25 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Our main differentiation is that we store all our content on chain


[13-Feb-18 04:25 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
This means users pay once, and can recall the data itself from the chain, forever


[13-Feb-18 04:26 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Orchid and Substratum however, are basically payment settlement layers for internet related services


[13-Feb-18 04:27 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Hope this helps!


[13-Feb-18 04:32 AM] lungov#3562
@WillRogerJones , what happens when two people store the same internet  page? Will the extension show an "are you sure" message at the latter attempt? Or will the page be stored twice with timestamps? Or something else?


[13-Feb-18 04:33 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
It'll be stored twice, once for each user with the page at the time they stored it


[13-Feb-18 04:37 AM] lungov#3562
Will the user be advised that another version of that page is already stored?


[13-Feb-18 04:37 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Probablt not by default, we could certainly build that functionality in if a lot of people are interested though


[13-Feb-18 04:39 AM] arweave-india#5075
Yeah I think that's an interesting idea @lungov - for me as a user it would definitely be good to know that. I think this is probably something we can enact later on.

Would other people be interested in this sort of functionality?


[13-Feb-18 04:43 AM] arweave-india#5075
One of the things I'm personally excited about is being able to see how the same webpage has changed between two different points in time - especially for pages like news articles, for example. I think this could provide really interesting/valuable insight - I'll have a think about potential UI implementations


[13-Feb-18 04:49 AM] lungov#3562
Me too, @archain-india! A lot of people will have to start being careful about the things they tweet as we will be able to tell if they edited it afterwards and, perhaps mostly importantly, what they wrote originally. But for static content, avoiding redundency should only make the tokens even more valuable imo.


[13-Feb-18 04:49 AM] lungov#3562
And not just twitter, of course.


[13-Feb-18 09:19 AM] Dameon1#4928
timestamps are key. Has anyone put a list together of, say, 500 sites that constantly change that would  need archiving? Both Dynamic and Static?


[14-Feb-18 12:32 AM] Marcin#0065
As for UI i can imagine sonething like google earth did it. They have something like a scale bar with different time points and you can move your marker with your mouse to the left or right. It will show sattelite images of the same place from different times. As for Berlin, it goes back to old plane photographs shortly after ww.


[15-Feb-18 06:49 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hi guys

@Dameon1 - not yet, I don't think, but I agree that seems necessary. 

@Marcin - yep I(/we) actually pictured the same thing for the 'timeline' UI! I think that would be great.

[19-Feb-18 09:28 AM] arweave-india#5075
@tierralibre Filecoin definitely (to a degree) occupies a similar space to us in the 'permanent data storage' use case, however of course they don't offer storage directly on the blockchain


[19-Feb-18 09:30 AM] arweave-india#5075

Hi @arweave-sam


[24-Feb-18 05:39 PM] peng_jpegs#0083
are there are apps currently planned?


[25-Feb-18 03:13 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hi all,

@Noxext : The timeline (https://medium.com/@arweave/archain-timeline-winter-spring-2018-935a44a43318) should have all the information you need -- let us know if you have any further questions!

@makiten : Not explicitly for personal health data (as far as I am aware), but we are working with a University hospital partner to build a system of permanent and verifiable data storage for medical studies. This has a whole bunch of really exciting properties which we will write about in a blog as soon as we get the green light to go properly public. Hopefully that should be in the next few weeks.

@Omer H#0083 : Absolutely! The internet archive and ArchiveIt (name to be confirmed) are ready to launch already. After the main network launch we expect to put most of our effort on fostering a development community that will develop their own apps, but we may also look at build some further first-party ones.

Enjoy the rest of your weekends, all!

However NXTs Tech is not future


[26-Feb-18 03:05 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@bruce the Arweave is similar to NXT in that it stores information permanently on the data structure itself (unlike Filecoin, etc). It is unlike NXT in terms of the underlying technology, a blockweave not a blockchain, which frees it from the transactions size and scalability limits experienced by NXT.

Hi


[28-Feb-18 02:07 PM] FatTony#5377
Where is the coin? Been waiting almost a year to get it


[28-Feb-18 02:09 PM] BBM#0001
The white paper was only released in August - so I think you may be mistaken


[28-Feb-18 02:09 PM] Dameon1#4928
And the actual sale isnt until April


[01-Mar-18 02:43 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hi @FatTony  - I think @BBM is right, as we only finished our token pre-sale back in August. As @Dameon1 rightly mentions, we're just building up to our main token sale in the near future, and then very shortly after that the main network will launch, when tokens will become tradable. If you want more info about the key dates for the Arweave project, I would definitely recommend checking out our timeline blog post on Medium here - https://medium.com/@arweave/archain-timeline-winter-spring-2018-935a44a43318

hi @Pancake


[05-Mar-18 06:52 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
IPFS/Filecoin are part of a family of storage blockchains that rely on proofs of retrievability, specifically they make use of a challenge/response protocol to ensure that a third party is holding the data and only ever store these proofs on the chain - not the data itself. Factom also does something similar, but on the bitcoin network - and instead of using proofs of retrieviability it just pushes periodic message digests.

Arweave on the other hand, stores data on the chain. We can do this because the blockweave data structure lets our the chain can be spread across many computers. This lets us maintain firm guarentees about the datas validity, etc that other projects can't make.

Hope this answers the question! Always here if you've got anymore


[05-Mar-18 07:00 AM] Pancake#8004
@WillRogerJones What's the advantages on keeping it on-chain as opposed to storing proofs of tretrievability?


[05-Mar-18 07:53 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
@Pancake The advantage of storing on chain is that the data becomes part of the proof of work going forward. This means two things: you pay once, and store forever, and that storage really is forever in archains case.


[05-Mar-18 07:54 AM] Pancake#8004
I see, because in ARweave, the miners are constantly being rewarded as part of the mining process for storage


[05-Mar-18 07:54 AM] Pancake#8004
Is there ongoing cost with IPFS/Filcoin and Factom? Does someone need to pay an monthly fee?


[05-Mar-18 07:56 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Yeah, thats exactly the case with IPFS/Filecoin


[05-Mar-18 07:56 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
If I remember correctly, you basically assign a number of blocks the data has to be stored for in filecoin, and are charged based on this


[05-Mar-18 07:59 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
I'm a little less familiar with Factom, but I believe that they don't charge based on time held


[05-Mar-18 07:59 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
but since they are piggybacking on the btc network, the amount of data that they can store at any given point is tiny - they're restirced to something like one hash every 10 minutes


[05-Mar-18 08:29 AM] Pancake#8004
Hmm... okay

Why do you need to raise so much money for the hard cap? How will the money be allocated?


[05-Mar-18 03:32 PM] arweave-india#5075
Only a minority of the token supply was sold during the seed pre-sale, we are now selling most of the remaining tokens. The funds will be used to maintain and develop the project in the years to come. Projects like ours require stewardship, development, and promotion over time in order to fully manifest, and our team is committed to working hard to achieve this. We also plan to use a significant portion of the funds raised to provide incentives for developers to build apps on top of the Arweave network (for example, like the Arweave app competition - https://medium.com/@arweave/the-first-archain-app-development-competition-ea43a9bd86b2). Encouraging developers to utilise Arweave serves the broader goals of the project and strengthens the token ecosystem.

@txpm621 , as @  said in the #tech-support channel, there will be a strong incentive for those that took part in the Aug-Sept sale period last year. The project and tech have come a long way since then. @vimal.s08  - the token supply in the genesis block is 55m AR, as it has always been, but to be clear, the hard cap and sale price have not been released yet — these will be coming soon.

How to set key file in ATN.1?


[07-Mar-18 06:02 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Hi @真善狠得自由> 

There are a few ways you can set your atn1 keyfile. If you don't have a key, but want one, you can set the new mining key flag when starting the server by adding the new_mining_key option and the server will generate you one. If you have the keyfile you want to load, you can use the 'load_mining_key' option, and provide the filepath to the key. Also, if you have the public key of the address you want to load, you can use the mining_addr option, and provide the public key.

For Example, to load the key "mykey.json":
./archain-server mine load_mining_key mykey.json


[07-Mar-18 06:05 AM] 真善狠得自由>#5484
I have the public key in the pre-sale


[07-Mar-18 06:07 AM] 真善狠得自由>#5484
what is a valid Archain network key file?


[07-Mar-18 06:16 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The test network uses a different set of keys than the main network (in order to keep real keys secure during the testing phase). To gain a key file for use on the test network you can either generate a new one with the new_mining_key flag, or visit your order page to generate a test net key for a wallet (with your normal balance) that will be added next time the network resets. If you can't find your order page, please send an email to 'team@arweave.org' and we will help you out.

How does your system archive?


[09-Mar-18 02:54 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Under the hood, each of the nodes in the network exposes an interface that allows you to 'get' or 'put' data. From the (non-developer) user's point of view there are various clients that provide different user interfaces. The one that might be most interesting to you is our web extension, which allows you to archive the webpage you are currently viewing with a couple of clicks.


[09-Mar-18 02:55 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You then get a link that you can share with others to retrieve the page from the decentralised network.


[09-Mar-18 02:56 AM] Deleted User#0000

@arweave-india I'm not really a staff member, but I thought getting in touch would be a good idea

If you guys could work on some collabs,that might be a cool result sometime


[09-Mar-18 03:24 AM] arweave-india#5075
Yeah definitely, really interested in things like this.

  glad you enjoy it!

@arweave-india  is there going to be masternodes for your network possibly or will it only be POW?


[10-Mar-18 04:28 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hi @dr6ix, Arweave uses a Proof of Access mechanism rather than master nodes or PoW. You can check out the details in the whitepaper: https://www.arweave.org/whitepaper.pdf

Is the token trading or what. too many confusing counterparts on cmc


[13-Mar-18 06:04 AM] Synergy#5794
I bought in during the ico or presale in january or whenever it was and have been sitting on them since. decided to have a look for them on cmc and boy oh boy am i confused


[13-Mar-18 06:06 AM] arweave-india#5075
Sorry to hear about the confusion! Tokens are not yet trading - they will be listed on exchanges after the launch of the main Arweave network (scheduled for 8th June 2018)


[13-Mar-18 07:21 AM] Kaspermertz#9618
When will the tokensale start


[13-Mar-18 10:28 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hi @Kaspermertz - You can find all of our upcoming key dates here on our timeline blog post on Medium, including sale info - https://medium.com/@arweave/archain-timeline-winter-spring-2018-935a44a43318

[15-Mar-18 11:01 AM] Simon#7927
do we allready know the price for the token sale?


[15-Mar-18 05:58 PM] jamesasb (IOTA Maximalist)#8349
i got some in presale which feels like a lifetimeago


[16-Mar-18 08:46 AM]  #3138
Im gonna assume ico will be 1-2$ a coin if they sold 10% at presale, 30% in private sale, and 10% in public sale which equates to 5 million coins at ico


[16-Mar-18 10:22 AM] Pancake#8004
If I were to host a website and use ARweave as my database and I would like to make edits to said website, would every revision to a file cost the same as uploading the file itself?


[16-Mar-18 10:33 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Depending on the size of the data it might be more efficient to publish a 'diff' of the updates to the file onto the weave, with a pointer back to the previous version. These 'modification' transactions allow you only to pay for the data you have altered, without affecting the underlying permanence and traceability of the system.


[16-Mar-18 10:50 AM] Pancake#8004
When fetching the data from the weave, is the performance affected if there are 10000+ diffs and each are stored in blocks that are in different nodes?


[16-Mar-18 11:05 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yes, you would want to publish a new full version every so often, depending on the size of the original file.


[16-Mar-18 11:11 AM] Pancake#8004
Makes sense!


[17-Mar-18 02:41 AM] HiteshB#8784
@arweave-sam I'm holding on to the keys from the pre-sale, do those have to be updated or modified in any way?


[17-Mar-18 07:56 PM] jamesasb (IOTA Maximalist)#8349
hope not dude i got the keys also


[18-Mar-18 05:05 PM] sullof#0095
I participated in the first sale (in August 2017 or a bit later I think). I didn't try but.. is that wallet still working?


[19-Mar-18 05:09 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hi all. There's no need to modify or update your keys, just make sure that you keep that wallet information safe for now

Will the team be attending any conferences in the near future? I'm in the US and would love to attend.


[19-Mar-18 12:53 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I will be talking at BlockchainUA on Friday, then in Berlin the week after. We don't have any more planned in the US right now, I am afraid!


[19-Mar-18 12:53 PM] arweave-sam#9630
The BlockchainUA talk should be on YouTube though, hopefully the Berlin one too.


[19-Mar-18 12:54 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I plan to go through the more 'commercial' side of the uses for the weave in the BlockchainUA talk, so hopefully that and the SF talk should give the full picture of the project.


[19-Mar-18 12:55 PM] mec1988#6670
I really enjoyed this talk.  I appreciated how Sam went into the topic I've been defending when presenting this project to my wife... The Blacklisting system.

I'm also talking quite a bit with all my crypto buddies about this project and this is a great video to share with them.  Thanks!


[19-Mar-18 12:59 PM] arweave-india#5075
Awesome! I agree about the convenience of the video too - it's a great overview of the project and a primary application of it (and covers the 'big questions' some people will have, like the blacklisting system).


[19-Mar-18 01:03 PM] mec1988#6670
One thing to note: The video description still refers to archain instead of Arweave throughout.


[19-Mar-18 01:04 PM] arweave-india#5075
Cheers for pointing that out - I'll drop the channel owner a message to see about amending it

Hey guys. Noticed the paid message on earn.com. Honestly speaking, I feel as though most people use the app just to collect Bitcoin and possibly an airdrop. Not sure how much use it will be to finding legitamite interest.

Fair enough Vimal - definitely always want the community's opinion :)


[20-Mar-18 04:06 PM] sullof#0095
One big problem with the blockchain in general is that when you save something it can not be modified. I hope that Arweave is thinking of some community-governed way to remove awful data. If not we risk something like this, that would be a huge problem

[20-Mar-18 04:09 PM] BBM#0001
It was a concern of mine too, sullof. There is a method to remove data such as this this, as well as being able to state what kind of data you wish to hold on to. I forget the specifics though!

@Puck342 did you see the terms of the sale have been changed?


[16-Apr-18 10:17 AM] Puck342#3354
I did not as I didn't have any plans on buying more tokens.


[16-Apr-18 10:17 AM] Puck342#3354
changed how? and are these changes retroactive to presale participants like myself?


[16-Apr-18 10:17 AM] information-corp#0984
they changed the cap


[16-Apr-18 10:19 AM] information-corp#0984
in fact, it appears they changed the entire structure of the sale. instead of a tiered approach


[16-Apr-18 10:20 AM] information-corp#0984
it looks like it will just be a flat rate at  44p


[16-Apr-18 11:59 AM] vimal.s08#6053

what was the initial cap again? higher or lower?

Hi Vimal I will look into this for you  right away

Puck - nothing happening now is retrospective at all, and will not affect the tokens of pre-sale participants like yourself.

The timeline says that today is the day of the main sale period.  Is that still the case?  I received an email on April 13 indicating the sale was coming up, but nothing since.


[19-Apr-18 01:31 PM] arweave-india#5075
That's right Mike - as we mentioned in the email we're pushing back the sale dates, so it's no longer beginning today, you're right

I get the feeling, that the focus changed a bit. What i mean specificly is: whereas last year the main idea was to backup webpages as they were at that time saving it, nowadays i get the feeling its mainly about backup storage. Since i liked the idea last year a lot and did put a little leftovers as "investment" (more or less), i would be a bit sad, if the main idea would collapse. Please tell me im wrong. It still very exiting to me tracking the progress of your project. And i still remember the very first life stream with 5 viewers :) keep doing good work and i wish u a blast time for the future!

Hey, I bought in pre-sale last year and have been out of the loop for a while - do I need to do anything to change my archain to arweave tokens or will that all happen automatically at some stage? I haven't accessed my wallet at all since my purchase. thanks


[24-Apr-18 03:41 PM] Marcin#0065
You dont need to do anything right now. There have never been an archain token so far. The arweave hasnt released yet. So all cool.


[26-Apr-18 04:49 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hi @Jacwil - @Marcin is entirely correct (thanks Marcin!) - you don't need to do anything, no need to worry. The only thing that changed was the name of the token, and tokens will become accessible after mainnet release (which will occur on the 8th of June).


[26-Apr-18 04:51 AM] arweave-india#5075
@! [[$0m€B0dy - Mainnet launch is still scheduled for 8th of June. Let us know if you have any other questions about mainnet!


[27-Apr-18 09:04 AM] Jacwil#4297
Great, thanks for the info guys


[27-Apr-18 11:02 AM] Puck342#3354
Just got the private sale email  - great to see the project progressing! Since there was a mention of the expectation of excess demand for the token, are there any plans for getting the token listed on exchanges for the purposes of satisfying that excess demand efficiently?


[27-Apr-18 02:49 PM] Pancake#8004
Regarding the pre-sale, will the Ethereum price be pegged to the same price as the main sale?

Hi when is the ico ?


[28-Apr-18 11:47 AM] BBM#0001
If you've been whitelisted, private sale is next Friday - 4th May.


[28-Apr-18 11:48 AM] arunc#8323
Where can I find the token metrics. I can’t find it in the light paper


[28-Apr-18 11:48 AM] mec1988#6670
May the fourth be with us


[28-Apr-18 11:54 AM] arunc#8323
Please can someone help with token metrics here ?


[28-Apr-18 11:55 AM] BBM#0001
Possibly going to have to wait for a member of staff to show up


[28-Apr-18 11:56 AM] BBM#0001
@arweave-india is usually around to answer questions, but it's quite likely that you'll need either Will or Sam. Not sure where they'll be around tonight with it being a Saturday!


[28-Apr-18 11:56 AM] BBM#0001
If you leave your question, one of them will get back to you


[28-Apr-18 12:10 PM] Marcin#0065
Arunc, if you have been whitelistet, you should get an email. If u havent got an email, go register urself for the sale. 
The price is 0.44 POUNDS for a token in the sale.


[28-Apr-18 12:12 PM] arunc#8323
Thanks. I just registered yet to receive the mail

Hi guys! 

Yep Puck that's the plan - we will release more info nearer mainnet launch (8th June of course!) 

@Pancake#1000  - The presale price was fixed at the time of the presale, and has not (and will not) be adjusted after that point. Feel free to DM me if you have any further questions about this.

Hi @arunc#8323 - I'll DM you to double check that your application to whitelist was received properly   I can also answer questions there for you if you like! 

@NB | synergy#3045 - Token name is AR (ticker: AR) - not listed on exchanges until after mainnet launches (in almost exactly 6 weeks now, on the 8th of June). Edit: apologies, I didn't tag you correctly the first time somehow @NB | synergy#3045

Just got the newest email - it's great to see things continuing to progress and I look forward to hearing what a success the private sale is once it is complete!


[02-May-18 08:14 PM] information-corp#0984
@arweave-india , sorry if this has been addressed, but how and when do pre-sale investors retrieve their tokens?


[02-May-18 08:14 PM] information-corp#0984
also, is there a specific post anywhere detailing the main sale, launch date, exchange listing, etc.?


[02-May-18 08:14 PM] information-corp#0984
thank you


[03-May-18 12:29 PM] vimal.s08#6053
Just want to check in with you guys once again. I'm an early supporter and I signed up for the main sale a long time ago and have not received any emails regarding it despite others receiving the emails. Hope you guys can make sure I'm part of the main sale given that it's oversubscribed.

How to get an ICO token


[04-May-18 07:22 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hey @vimal.s08  - @WillRogerJones is  looking into this for you right now


[04-May-18 07:33 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hi again Vimal - I'll DM you about the details but everything does appear in order and I can see you on our list of sign-ups!


[04-May-18 07:40 AM] arweave-india#5075
@ELLIES We are compiling the final list of participants for the private sale - if you shoot me a DM right now I will do whatever I can to get you added to the pre-whitelist


[04-May-18 07:48 AM] arweave-india#5075
@information-corp - Pre-sale tokens (along with all others!) will be released and accessible via wallet at mainnet launch on the 8th of June

there's no new timeline right now, but exchange-listing will occur shortly after mainnet launch 

Private token sale is actually happening at the moment (we're sending out whitelist confirmations to  people today). There will be a final (small!) public sale between now and mainnet launch, but we haven't released final dates publicly yet


[04-May-18 07:48 AM] arweave-india#5075
Let me know if you have any further questions at all guys - always happy to help


[04-May-18 08:08 AM] arweave-india#5075
@Puck342 Thank you for the kind words  


[04-May-18 09:17 AM] Mike#2447
Is the project still planning on implementing wallet fees and has that been coordinated with the exchanges?  Also, has a mining protocol been finalized?  Thanks for all the help India!


[04-May-18 10:37 AM] Marcin#0065
Using the sha256 algorythm will end up having miners in big mining farms. And not everybody i willing to run another room with hdds to operate. At least that is my thought right now. Have you been thinking how to avoid that szenario? There wouldnt be much difference havin either big cloud farms as google or big mining farms. I understand your vision differently and hope everyone will be able to take part in the prozess of mining, even with small computers. Even the private miners wont keep hdds to run the mining process. And the lowet the number of miners, the higher the capacity needed. And watching ur chart of expanding data usage, im a little afraid a bad ending could occur due to a algorithm noone can use economicly.


[04-May-18 10:40 AM] arweave-india#5075
Mike - No we have actually found a way to get rid of wallet fees. This is part of the blockshadows system that we describe in the lightpaper (see a copy here: https://arweave.org/files/arweave-lightpaper.pdf ). 

Hi Marcin - I'm not with the dev team right now but I believe your thinking is largely in line with theirs and they're working through solutions.


[04-May-18 10:54 AM] BBM#0001
Hi @arweave-india  - should be whitelisted but have yet to receive any information about purchasing in the private sale. Have I missed it or has the email not gone out just yet?


[04-May-18 11:05 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hi Vyrrt - You're right - the whitelist status confirmation emails have not yet been sent  


[04-May-18 11:09 AM] Synergy#5794
What are you talking about whitelist and icos? I swear I bought my tokens months ago


[04-May-18 11:11 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hi @Synergy - that's right we had a pre-sale ('seed' token sale) later on in 2017, and right now there is a small (and oversubscribed) private token sale ongoing. However, all token sales will be wrapped up in advance of the mainnet launch which is now just a few weeks away - set for 8th of June


[04-May-18 11:11 AM] Synergy#5794
Alright thanks for clarifying that


[04-May-18 12:35 PM] arweave-india#5075
No problem!

Hi all

@information-corp - We will definitely be sending out token claiming info in the near future to all sale participants, including from the 2017 sale! We did send out a little update email recently including info about the current private sale to everyone who has shared their email address with us (including presale participants) - so do drop me a DM if you didn't get this and I'll double check that everything is in order for you

@vimal.s08#6053 Cool! Glad you're spotting them in the wild   We're ramping up marketing now and we're definitely seeing lots of community growth

[09-May-18 01:12 AM] CoSeed#1021
Hi guys


[09-May-18 12:18 PM] arweave-india#5075
Hi everyone!

@2072 [ANFRA] The Upvest sale has now closed, actually. But don't worry - all of our community members who were sent an confirmation email as they successfully whitelisted for the private sale still have until the end of the date specified in their confirmation email to make their transfer. We have safeguarded your guys' allocations! 

@CoSeed - Welcome!


[09-May-18 03:05 PM] Mike#2447
Hi India, the email I received after the whitelist request just said to wait for more information.  It sounds like maybe I didn't receive the confirmation email?


[10-May-18 01:30 PM] information-corp#0984
@arweave-india thank you for your replies. is there a place where we can follow updates on the sale? how much has been sold?  thanks


[10-May-18 04:14 PM] arweave-india#5075
Hey @information-corp ! Our upcoming Telegram announcement channel is happening soon, but our main Telegram group is: http://t.me/arweave We'd love to have you over there everyone!

To give you guys a quick run-down of what I am able to share, in case you don't yet know:

- We have gained traction and publicity incredibly quickly over the past 1-2 weeks, with visits to our website, whitelisting applicants from new people, etc., all increasing exponentially
- Our Arweave Telegram group just this evening reached 20,000 members! This is truly amazing to us, and very exciting for the whole community! 
- We're now less than 30 days from our mainnet launch! HUGE thanks to all of you who have been so patient for so long. It has been almost a whole year since the project was first imagined atop a British mountain by @arweave-sam , our CEO... and since then we've made huge amounts of progress- we appreciate your role in this greatly.
- We are SO far beyond oversubscribed for our final token sale(s) now... I can't share explicit figures publicly yet but will be able to soon! 

Finally, we will be continuing prioritising you guys - our community - as we move forward through the sales periods to mainnet launch. Thank you for your support and patience for however long you have been part of our community!

As always, my PMs and my email inbox are both open (india@arweave.org) - look forward to hearing from any and all of you with your feedback and questions.

All the best,

India

Hey @CoSeed  -  We're in the process of making decisions about allocations for funds/groups, etc., in the private round. We're working on the best way to allocate tokens based on the long-term benefit to all in the community

If you want to drop me a message on Telegram (@ArweaveIndia) or email (india@arweave.org) feel free to do so

Hi @JeanCoin ! Yep the whitelisting application via our website is what you're looking for: www.arweave.org . As the cap is small and the demand is very high, we're still working out the most fair way to make allocations, but all whitelist applicants will be contacted soon with further details of this

[14-May-18 03:44 PM] CryptoLamer#0730
Hi, Arweave team! I'm in progress of making review and have some questions for you.

Does arweave support smart contracts?

And if it does how often contracts is created? I mean isn't it uneconomical to create and update contract for every download and upload of files? How is the payment process going between renter of storage place and the host?

Why is your structure cheaper than in  sia and filecoin for example? I don't  quite understand from lightpaper.

Thank You!


[14-May-18 04:29 PM] stuninslave#7023
Hi everyone!

I've read the WP  and have some questions.
Is there any good explanation how data will be stored on-chain?


[15-May-18 05:38 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
@stuninslave  Data is stored on chain in the same way that any data is stored on a standard blockchain system - the data is simply added to each block to be mined.

Arweave can do this because our technology allows us to shard the chain, meaning that no individual user needs to hold the whole weave. This makes it economical to have these potentially large blocks, without compriomising the benefits of blockchain technology.


[15-May-18 05:46 PM] stuninslave#7023
No individual user have to store the whole file , for example.


[15-May-18 05:47 PM] stuninslave#7023
it might be that the file is splited among miners


[15-May-18 05:47 PM] stuninslave#7023
lets say we have 1GB file. and want to store it on-chain.


[15-May-18 05:48 PM] stuninslave#7023
How it could be achieved? 
100 miners would hold 10mb partition of the file?


[15-May-18 05:48 PM] stuninslave#7023
or some partitions will be stored twice?


[15-May-18 05:49 PM] stuninslave#7023
what if a single partition lost from every miner


[16-May-18 02:56 AM] enilsen16#0335
@stuninslave  To my knowledge the network doesn't chunk files yet


[16-May-18 02:56 AM] enilsen16#0335
So if the file is 1gb, it'll be stored in a single transaction.


[16-May-18 03:18 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Yeah, currently there is no native chunking in the system - A 1gb file will have to be replicated by multiple people


[16-May-18 03:19 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
There is a strong incentive for people to do chunking of their own volition though - the cost per byte increases when files grow very large


[16-May-18 03:51 AM] stuninslave#7023
Ok. What are use cases?


[16-May-18 05:58 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Generalised, verifiable data storage! A use case I particularaly like is by the Charité teaching hospital in Berlin. They are building a new journal of raw data on the system that takes davantage of Arweaves verifiability and ecnomoies of scale. There is a whitepaper out about it at the moment, see: http://thejournalofrawdata.org/JoRD_v100.pdf

Just met the team from @ArweaveTeam . They are taking on the file storage problem but they are actually storing the data on the blockchain unlike their competitors in this space. Their raise is 150x over subscribed. Another one to look out for...

[17-May-18 10:42 AM] Puck342#3354
Hey, quick question - has anything changed for.presalers for token claiming once mainnet goes live? Will the address/PK we were given back then still be valid or has anything changed is i guess my question. Great to see the positive publicity!


[17-May-18 01:39 PM] Doc#8536
Hi guys, what about GDRP compliance for Arweave ? Is it in the works ?


[18-May-18 06:24 AM] arweave-india#5075
@Doc Yep, certainly in the works. We'll have a system at launch that ensures we are compliant, and that makes compliance for everyone storing data simple


[18-May-18 06:25 AM] arweave-india#5075
@Puck342 Hi! Nope, nothing has changed for you guys. We'll be sending out instructions before mainnet launch to everyone, including you guys of course, with instructions about wallet generation, addresses, how to access tokens generally, etc.

[19-May-18 12:14 AM] Waleed#2376
i have shown my interest in mining by having an arweave node


[19-May-18 07:44 AM] Midriaz#2898
Hello! Will Arweave support private data which can be read only by it's owner?


[19-May-18 07:46 AM] BBM#0001
@Midriaz I would imagine that to do that, you could encrypt the data with whatever algorithm you wanted before putting it on the blockweave. It'd be useless to anyone other than those with the key then.


[19-May-18 08:05 AM] Pancake#8004
@BBM I would not recommend this for data that needs to be permanently private, however, because computing power is increasing exponentially and historically "unbreakable" encryption has now been broken


[19-May-18 08:07 AM] Midriaz#2898
@Pancake hm, this is a good point. But really there is a small portion of data that should be private forever.


[19-May-18 08:08 AM] Pancake#8004
Right now, my best guess for privacy is around 20 years


[19-May-18 08:08 AM] Pancake#8004
for current encryption


[19-May-18 08:08 AM] BBM#0001
Valid point @Pancake . Hadnt really considered that.


[19-May-18 08:08 AM] Pancake#8004
(Wild guess)


[19-May-18 08:12 AM] Pancake#8004
I think private storage is not the main use case for ARweave and you could find cheaper solutions. Even storing on Google Drive with your data encrypted.


[19-May-18 08:13 AM] Pancake#8004
ARweave incentivizes highly redundant storage and good node behavior with high I/O which is actually fairly expensive when compared to centralized solutions


[19-May-18 08:13 AM] Pancake#8004
It would be a good publishing platform for things that need to be highly accessed (millions of views per day) or used as proof of existence (contracts), or want to benefit from uncensorability of the blockchain, or want to benefit from the permanence of storage.


[19-May-18 08:14 AM] Pancake#8004
Videos, books, papers, contracts, etc.


[19-May-18 08:20 AM] Midriaz#2898
@Pancake thanks for your opinion, you are really good at that   Indeed, i was trying to understand if Arweave is suitable for a video hosting with a paid content, so someone can't get the content directly from blockchain for free.


[19-May-18 08:21 AM] Pancake#8004
Yes. Actually this would be a good use case. Encrypt + give out encryption keys to those who pay


[19-May-18 08:22 AM] Pancake#8004
Depending on the views/performance/permanence you need, I might instead recommend IPFS


[19-May-18 08:22 AM] Pancake#8004
Or even a centralized solution if you don't need the uncensorability


[19-May-18 08:24 AM] Midriaz#2898
but it should be more expensive that ARweave


[19-May-18 08:24 AM] Pancake#8004
ARweave would be the most expensive solution out of the three


[19-May-18 08:24 AM] Pancake#8004
Because video requires so much space to store


[19-May-18 08:25 AM] Pancake#8004
Unless you need to benefit from the 1m views per day and permanence of storage, I probably wouldn't recommend it


[19-May-18 08:26 AM] Midriaz#2898
maybe, we still don't have enough information to evaluate how much it will cost to upload a 1MB data


[19-May-18 08:28 AM] Pancake#8004
I'm not sure how much it will cost, but by nature of ARweave, likely we'll be seeing redundancy 100x+ per piece of data


[19-May-18 08:28 AM] Pancake#8004
This will likely be much more expensive than other solutions


[19-May-18 08:28 AM] Pancake#8004
Also, they're incentivizing high throughput and timely data connection, which will add additional cost


[19-May-18 08:29 AM] Pancake#8004
I would say it should be 100x more expensive than the next cheapest solution if you need temporary storage


[19-May-18 08:29 AM] Pancake#8004
Where temporary is a few years


[19-May-18 08:30 AM] Pancake#8004
(Wild guess, again)


[19-May-18 08:30 AM] Midriaz#2898
That would be a disappointment


[19-May-18 08:31 AM] Pancake#8004
I think it has a great use case for publishing papers/contracts/books though


[19-May-18 08:31 AM] Pancake#8004
Anything that you need to be uncensored is a good use case as well


[19-May-18 08:31 AM] Pancake#8004
Video will be expensive so likely a lot less people will store vieos


[19-May-18 08:32 AM] Midriaz#2898
This is dramatically reduce use-cases of ARweave


[19-May-18 08:32 AM] Pancake#8004
It does


[19-May-18 08:40 AM] Pancake#8004
It's fairly cheap for a highly available uncensorable public archive (BTC/ETH being competitors), so I would look towards that direction for use cases


[19-May-18 08:40 AM] Pancake#8004
Also, on the tech side, finding a way to scale on-chain storage is fairly novel


[19-May-18 08:41 AM] Pancake#8004
So, we may see blockweaves in other blockchains someday as well


[19-May-18 08:41 AM] Midriaz#2898
yes, i understand that it is still good place for legal documents, etc.


[20-May-18 01:13 PM] Aliaksandr#7787
hi all, do we have any instructions for mining already? or at least high-level requirements?


[21-May-18 12:18 AM] George-Woo#0112
does the team have estimates for the cost/gb of storage? i understand it might be higher than comparable solutions but you cant beat  pay once store forever  


[21-May-18 09:37 AM] captainsidd#2614
Like @Aliaksandr I am also wondering if anyone has resources for mining. I am setting up a mining farm in the US and am familiar with traditional PoW mining but would also like to diversify into hard drive "mining" to support storage protocols like Arweave!

I met Sam in NYC last week and enjoyed our short conversation and the vision behind this protocol. Happy to support it any way I can!


[22-May-18 01:59 PM] HiteshB#8784
Hi!
@arweave-india just fyi - the ICO has a fairly low rating here : https://icobench.com/ico/arweave


[22-May-18 01:59 PM] HiteshB#8784
might keep people away from investing in a great idea


[22-May-18 02:00 PM] HiteshB#8784
Additionally, for the performance of an ICO, it is ideal to have a dedicated marketing team running. This can help significantly with both raising capital and garnering attention.

{Reactions}
  

[22-May-18 02:01 PM] HiteshB#8784
I'll take into example  Basic Attention Token - I was an ICO participant, and the marketing left a lot to be desired. While I had exited somewhere near a peak, the token proceeded to pull back nearly 80% from its high even though the team was active and make a great product.


[22-May-18 02:01 PM] HiteshB#8784
Just a few suggestions from a small pre-sale participant  


[22-May-18 02:02 PM] HiteshB#8784
The team then was amazing - so it is here too, might be running behind schedule but I didn't enter Arweave with a timeline in mind.


[22-May-18 02:02 PM] HiteshB#8784
Please do advertise it fully  


[24-May-18 05:50 PM] Multicraft#4027

[27-May-18 09:20 AM] coinangel#9202
What is the difference between Arweave vs PO.ET


[28-May-18 04:34 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
@coinangel Though our goals are similar, we approach them very differently. po.et, as far as I understand, is basically a fork of bitcoin used to store small amounts of metadata. Arweave on the other hand makes use of our new technology to store large amounts of data on our weave itself.


[28-May-18 10:04 PM] vimal.s08#6053
Have you guys connected with www.gutenberg.org? They have a creative commons collection of 57,000 e-books that they hold on Dropbox, Google drive and OneDrive. They require donations to continue funding the project so I'm guessing the arweave would be a super useful and cheap solution for them.


[29-May-18 08:19 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
@vimal.s08 I'm not sure we have talked to them yet, but it'd be great to work with them


[29-May-18 08:19 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
To be honest, I'm a pretty big fan - I read quite a lot, particularaly when I'm travelling and I get a decent number of E-books off them


[29-May-18 10:05 AM] Marcin#0065
Will you implement "one time only download" links to the same data?


[29-May-18 10:06 AM] Marcin#0065
In that case a lot companies would profit out of arweave


[29-May-18 10:11 AM] vimal.s08#6053
@WillRogerJones looking forward to the next blog post where you guys share the top 10 books you'd not want burned  


[31-May-18 01:59 PM] HiteshB#8784
@WillRogerJones Is the ICO currently in progress?


[01-Jun-18 03:27 PM] rroque#7148
Hi arweave Team I was just wondering how you are above bluezelle and other storage icos like file coin and  sia —how do you guarantee immutable and permanent storage of files and data?


[02-Jun-18 05:24 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Hi @HiteshB 
Sorry for the late reply. You'd be best off checking the main telegram channel for ICO details. I'm focused on backend development instead of the sale, so I won't be able to help as much as those guys.

Hi @rroque 
Our immutability and permanence of data is guaranteed because we make the data part of the ongoing proof of work for the system going forward. The data becomes an immutable part of the blockweave itself, as irrevocable as any bitcoin transaction history.


[02-Jun-18 05:25 AM] DrEd23 (3,3)#4993
Sha 358 correct? What kind of miner does that.


[02-Jun-18 05:26 AM] DrEd23 (3,3)#4993
All I know is sha 256 with bitcoin mining.


[02-Jun-18 05:26 AM] DrEd23 (3,3)#4993
Sorry 384


[02-Jun-18 05:26 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
As far as I know, very few use SHA384


[02-Jun-18 05:27 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
The idea of the centralisation of mining power rather goes against our philosophy, so we'd love to switch to a completely ASIC resistant algorithm

[02-Jun-18 05:28 AM] Dom | ID-267610913773715456#6192
Not sure if it's a local error, or something broader.


[02-Jun-18 05:28 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Works fine for me, think it might be a local error


[02-Jun-18 05:29 AM] Dom | ID-267610913773715456#6192
Okay no problem,That's a relief.


[02-Jun-18 05:29 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
To continue from above - there are several reasons why traditional ASIC resistant algorithms don't play well with Arweave


[02-Jun-18 05:29 AM] DrEd23 (3,3)#4993
Of course so more gpu mining. 1080s


[02-Jun-18 05:30 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
So, for now, we've taken SHA384, for which there are not any GPU miners so far as we are aware yet


[02-Jun-18 05:30 AM] DrEd23 (3,3)#4993

I'd imagine that'd be a good way to do it


[02-Jun-18 05:32 AM] DrEd23 (3,3)#4993
Cool they’re a bit complex for me. But I’m an accredited investor anyway I still can get in.


[02-Jun-18 05:33 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Not my call, I stay entirely away from the sale so I can focus on the dev. I'll bring it up with somebody who is doing the sale if you like though

He won't get priority, I will simply check with the team he was not rejected unfairly


[02-Jun-18 05:50 AM] DrEd23 (3,3)#4993
It really doesn’t but it allows sometimes me to get in since I am in the USA.


[02-Jun-18 09:36 AM] Gyunikuchan#8567
was directed here from telegram, been thinking about the following:

Besides economic incentive via PoA, are there any other measures in place in the present or in the future to better keep track of rare blocks so as to ensure that data are not lost forever?
PoA economics alone may not work if miners are not aware/can't keep track of what is considered a rare block (a.k.a almost extinct data)


[02-Jun-18 09:37 AM] Patziggy#9371
@WillRogerJones Theres an interesting article authored by a member of the Siacoin team earlier this month that examines the current state of mining and ASIC resistance. May offer some useful information.

ASIC storage miner is called an ssd i guess XD


[02-Jun-18 09:39 AM] Patziggy#9371
Has there been any consideration in terms of multiple algorithms being used (such as in Digibyte)? Allegedly that helps with centralization to a degree.

[03-Jun-18 11:13 AM] Midriaz#2898
Hello! I have a question about token sale: contribution address will be same for round 2 (50 ETH max)?


[03-Jun-18 05:06 PM] Puck342#3354
what is considered acceptable for the "Address Document" for KYC?


[04-Jun-18 10:01 AM] HiteshB#8784
@WillRogerJones is there a deadline to doing the KYC? I have my exams this week  


[04-Jun-18 10:05 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Hey @Puck342 @HiteshB @Midriaz, I'm not sure I can help much with these questions - try our main telegram channel


[04-Jun-18 10:05 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
Though there is definitely a deadline for KYC


[04-Jun-18 10:07 AM] HiteshB#8784
Okay!


[04-Jun-18 10:27 AM] Puck342#3354
@WillRogerJones yeah i heard from India it's like a bill or whatever


[04-Jun-18 10:27 AM] Puck342#3354
bit of a negative shock to give a project money in mid-2017 and then hear in mid-2018 you need to do KYC, tbh


[04-Jun-18 10:32 AM] WillRogerJones#8527
@Puck342 I'm sorry to hear that. In some ways we'd also love to be able to do without it, but we're unfortunately unable to do anything else


[04-Jun-18 10:36 AM] Puck342#3354
yeah, i get it, but i feel bad for anyone who gave Archain a bunch of ETH in 2017 and then can't complete KYC in 2018


[04-Jun-18 10:37 AM] Puck342#3354
as one would have to assume, from any sufficient population, there would be an incidence of at least 1 or more people who invested in Archain in part *because* they couldn't complete KYC, for any number of reasons. including lacking a regular/reliable place to live, or proper government documentation


[04-Jun-18 10:49 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hey Puck - I'm sorry, unfortunately we have absolutely had to as per legal advice  


[04-Jun-18 10:50 AM] arweave-india#5075
@HiteshB No - no specific deadline, but we can't release tokens until KYC is submitted. Please do PM me here or email me at india@arweave.org if you have any questions at all.

the actual form itself just takes a few minutes, but I understand people will of course have other demand on their time


[04-Jun-18 10:51 AM] arweave-india#5075
@Midriaz - The ETH address won't necessary be the same, but it will be via Upvest.co 

Everyone who is able to participate (they have a community sale part two allocation, they have passed KYC) will be emailed instructions about this before the final 24 hrs begins

@wolfgang Actually there's no explorer for the testnet, but we have a web browser extension where presale/seed sale backers can view their token totals if they already have their keys handy. However we'll be sending out more wallet generation information ahead of mainnet launch for a new multi token wallet that backers can also use


[05-Jun-18 01:00 PM] Puck342#3354
i have to say i was skittish at first but the turnaround on the KYC submission was pretty quick


[06-Jun-18 09:19 AM] DeanRey#5479
@Puck342  agreed. One of the most pain free that I've come across in crypto space. Well done @arweave-india  and the arweave team. Good luck with the mainnet launch. We're rooting for ya

hello, what do we have to do for kyc? when is the ico date?


[07-Jun-18 09:15 AM] arweave-india#5075
@information-corp We advise to do it promptly, but for seed sale (AKA presale) backers there's no hard deadline at this point, but we won't be able to release your tokens until you have completed KYC.

The sale is now completely finished (as of about 20 hours ago), and mainnet launch is the 8th!!


[07-Jun-18 09:15 AM] arweave-india#5075
@DeanRey and @Puck342 Very, very glad to hear it guys, we tried to make it as simple and quick as possible  


[07-Jun-18 09:39 AM] Puck342#3354
Anything else we need to do in this last 24 hours before mainnet? Aside from KYC?


[07-Jun-18 09:40 AM] arweave-india#5075
Nope you guys don't need to do anything else yet - there will be wallet generation instructions coming to everyone who has completed KYC already in the next 48 hours approximately


[07-Jun-18 10:01 AM] Mike#2447
1.  Is there and ETA for exchange listings?
2.  Will a block explorer or some way to check address balances be made available?
3.  Will updated code be published to GitHub for miners to use, or is the change to mainnet based only on IP address?


[07-Jun-18 10:45 AM] Mike#2447
I have since found an answer to question #2 from the documentation on GitHub.


[07-Jun-18 02:07 PM] information-corp#0984
@arweave-india


[07-Jun-18 02:07 PM] information-corp#0984
is the email from team@arweave.org the legitimate KYC email you sent?


[07-Jun-18 02:07 PM] information-corp#0984
just want to check it's not phishing


[07-Jun-18 02:08 PM] arweave-india#5075
Hey infocorp - yeah we did indeed send one - but be really careful to check for spoofed email addresses


[07-Jun-18 02:08 PM] arweave-india#5075
If it takes you to an arweave.org domain to do the KYC itself you're good


[07-Jun-18 02:08 PM] information-corp#0984
ok thanks


[07-Jun-18 02:08 PM] information-corp#0984
turnaround time?


[07-Jun-18 02:08 PM] information-corp#0984
i will have to complete this tonight


[07-Jun-18 02:09 PM] information-corp#0984
it's afternoon here in U.S.


[07-Jun-18 02:09 PM] arweave-india#5075
Sometimes it's automatically accepted, so turnaround is instant, but sometimes (if the image is not clear enough, or the software has issues with the ID doc for some reason) it has to go to manual review and we have to check it individually


[07-Jun-18 02:10 PM] arweave-india#5075
So to try and keep the turnaround quick, make sure it's a clear photo decent resolution, not taken at a slanted angle, and just make sure your D.O.B. and name etc is accurately typed (naturally!)


[07-Jun-18 02:10 PM] arweave-india#5075
I can't say when for certain the manual review would be completed I'm afraid


[07-Jun-18 02:10 PM] arweave-india#5075
But we're going to get through them ASAP to ensure you guys get wallet access as soon as possible


[07-Jun-18 02:11 PM] information-corp#0984
ok thanks. it would be more than a shame to not have instant access to the tokens, after being in the pre-sale almost 1 year


[07-Jun-18 02:12 PM] information-corp#0984
and being notified that we have to do this a few days before the launch


[07-Jun-18 02:12 PM] information-corp#0984
hopefully, any manual reviews will be prompt, to say the least


[07-Jun-18 02:12 PM] arweave-india#5075
I know, I'm sorry we couldn't give you longer than a week


[07-Jun-18 02:12 PM] arweave-india#5075
Yep of course


[07-Jun-18 02:17 PM] information-corp#0984
is the information on the main sale listed anywhere?


[07-Jun-18 02:18 PM] arweave-india#5075
Generally not actually, as it ended up being a private invite-only sale so as per legal advice this is available on request for sale participants and Arweave token buyers such as yourself only. Feel free to PM me if you want in depth info on the sale, I'd be happy to help.


[07-Jun-18 02:19 PM] information-corp#0984
ok thank you


[07-Jun-18 02:19 PM] information-corp#0984
i may PM you later today. have meetings now


[07-Jun-18 02:19 PM] information-corp#0984
thanks for your hlep


[07-Jun-18 02:19 PM] arweave-india#5075

[07-Jun-18 02:40 PM] DeanRey#5479
Great communication @arweave-india and thanks for answering all these questions. Hopefully you get your life back on 9th June  


[07-Jun-18 02:41 PM] arweave-india#5075
Haha maybe one day @DeanRey   But you know I'm always happy to help you guys


[07-Jun-18 02:41 PM] tierralibre#2740
For people who did the first community round. Upvest will contact us for KYC correct? Because I have heard nothing from them.


[07-Jun-18 02:43 PM] arweave-india#5075
Ah no problem - we will be sending you an email ourselves


[07-Jun-18 02:43 PM] arweave-india#5075
Please can you double check the inbox and junk/spam folder of your registered email address to be sure  it didn't pass under your radar?


[07-Jun-18 02:44 PM] arweave-india#5075
If the email is from team@Arweave.org and it takes you to an arweave.org domain to complete your KYC you're good to go. Upvest help on the back end with this, but the comms are our own


[07-Jun-18 04:14 PM] flamesx#4524
Hi India, I have a question about token allocation? Is it convenient to ask atm?


[07-Jun-18 04:15 PM] arweave-india#5075
Sure @flamesx Feel free to PM me I'd be happy to help

Busy at the moment but I will get back to you as soon as possible I promise  


[07-Jun-18 04:17 PM] flamesx#4524
Upvest provided us with the token metrics. I wonder what the community seed, reserve and Ecosystem allocation are for ?


[07-Jun-18 04:18 PM] flamesx#4524
 


[07-Jun-18 04:25 PM] arweave-india#5075
Of course- the seed round is the 'presale' token sale that we had in August/Sept 2017, the 'reserve' is locked up for 5 years and will be kept by the project (this is the portion of remaining tokens that has a possibility of being sold to raise further project funds in several years' time should this be required), and the ecosystem allocation is for various things. The ecosystem portion will be used for: developer incentives (such as the developer bounty campaign starting in a few days), charitable donation of storage space for important and historical documents (such as for archives and libraries), and other adoption incentives. The ecosystem tokens won't be sold, basically, but they will be used gradually over time to build the AR token 'ecosystem' and drive adoption of the core technology and the blockweave archive itself.

Fantastic. Thanks for detailed answer. Based on my understanding, correct me if I am wrong :), community seed, statergic, private sale, community seed part 1 and part 2 are just various stages of raising fund. If it is correct,can the bonus for different stages be disclosed?  


[08-Jun-18 03:46 AM] flamesx#4524
*community sale part 1 , part 2

when/what next for token disbursement and wallet generation? it said to wait further instructions but, you seem to have mentioned the release date was today


[08-Jun-18 01:35 PM] arweave-india#5075
@flamesx Yep that's right - feel free to PM me for specific questions about the rounds  


[08-Jun-18 01:35 PM] arweave-india#5075
@information-corp - You guys will be getting an email today (as you have completed KYC) with wallet generation instructions!


[08-Jun-18 01:56 PM] Puck342#3354
those emails still going out today? I only ask because i know it is getting late in the EU


[08-Jun-18 01:57 PM] arweave-india#5075
Yes they are  


[08-Jun-18 01:57 PM] arweave-india#5075
As Sam just mentioned on Telegram: 

We are currently making the final adjustments to the network topology, finalising the Genesis block messages, and running through the launch checklist.


[08-Jun-18 01:57 PM] arweave-india#5075
Then mainnet will be launched and you guys will get your wallet generation instructions


[08-Jun-18 02:18 PM] Scalefinity#7851

@NewbieFT @thegoat19 

Guys we absolutely do not endorse reselling here or on any of our official platforms.

Please exercise extreme caution - there are many scammers around and we have no way to screen for this and protect you on these platforms


[14-Jun-18 08:49 AM] arweave-india#5075
@HiteshB - We can't publicly comment on exchanges yet I'm afraid! We are in high-level talks with a number at the moment, and naturally listing is a top priority for us


[14-Jun-18 09:03 AM] arweave-india#5075
@HiteshB Also, no, if you have completed KYC and generated your Upvest wallet, you're good to go!


[14-Jun-18 09:26 AM] thegoat19#8424
You can setup an admin based OTC channel

[17-Jun-18 12:07 PM] vimal.s08#6053
Hey Sam or Will .... Could you guys please go over the incentive structure regarding the blacklist? I might be wrong here but I feel like a supermajority should be required 70-80%** rather than the 50% mark.


[17-Jun-18 12:11 PM] vimal.s08#6053
It seems that our collective cultural blacklistable items are fairly limited and a 50% provision can possibly lead to censorship.

All the genesis block messages are indeed in the genesis block of course! Block explorer coming soon...


[20-Jun-18 09:24 AM] Mike#2447
Is there any chance we could get an update on what is happening with the project?  Maybe a brief blog post or  updated timeline or something?  Ever since mainnet launch, things seem to have gone dark.  Is the dev team working on stuff in secret or taking a holiday?  I'm not trying to be snarky, it's just there's very little transparency.  Thanks!


[20-Jun-18 09:35 AM] arweave-india#5075
Yes of course we're definitely working on things! No holidays for us yet! For example the dev team is polishing the Arweave web browser extension based wallet, we're working through token distribution too which requires helping people from back in 2017 through all the KYC and wallet generation processes which takes some resources too


[20-Jun-18 09:46 AM] Mike#2447
Sounds good!  I see talk on Telegram about "unlocking" tokens later this week, while I still have not received my deposit.  Is there a final token distribution day coming up?


[20-Jun-18 10:39 AM] arweave-india#5075
Distribution to everyone who has generated wallets already will be done soon, and then after that tokens will be unlocked (become transferable) later this week


[20-Jun-18 10:40 AM] ImMooning#9020
when exchange?


[20-Jun-18 10:44 AM] wolfgang#3017
@arweave-india I really want to hear abt the official wallet, mainnet explorer, exchanges and working platform


[20-Jun-18 10:44 AM] wolfgang#3017
When we will get these all?


[20-Jun-18 11:25 AM] arweave-india#5075
Working platform - the mainnet is up and running now (as of launch day on the 8th of June), but the Arweave wallet mentioned below doubles as a webpage archiving tool as per the original use case idea that we had. File storage specifically will be available later on (not too far in the future) - the 'ArchiveIt!' prototype was running on the testnet so that just needs updating and the UI/UX polishing up for the mainnet.

Blockexplorer - will be available in the coming weeks/months. This is underway and good progress has been made already - which I've seen in action of course. 

Arweave wallet - will be available simultaneous to when tokens are transferable, so later this week. You will then be able to choose to use this and transfer tokens from your Upvest wallet to the Arweave wallet if you like (the Arweave wallet can also be used as a cold wallet if you like)

Exchanges - we still can't comment on this publicly unfortunately, though we're in high-level and very advanced discussions with a number of good exchanges. Ultimately exchanges control the specific timing of listings however, that's in their hands.

@arweave-india @Supermod someone should restrict it so that normal users (white names) cannot tag @ everyone


[29-Jun-18 12:07 PM] Puck342#3354
on a more positive note, great to hear that talks with exchanges are progressing. and totally reasonable that nothing more than that can be said, you can't wave at an exchange without signing 2 NDAs first


[29-Jun-18 12:11 PM] Mike#2447
I think it might benefit the team to add a mod or two who can clean up these channels when they get spammed.  No offense to Oksi up there, but I don't believe those posts are related to the Arweave project LOL.

Thanks and hope all is well  


[04-Jul-18 03:51 PM] bitcoinBeliever&30k_by_2020#6947
When can we use macOS to mine?


[04-Jul-18 03:54 PM] arweave-india#5075
@bitcoinBeliever&30k_by_2020 Not quite yet, but it is on the development plan. We would like to make the set-up and running of mining much more user friendly across different OSs.


[04-Jul-18 03:55 PM] arweave-india#5075
@Patziggy Yes that's right - here's the URL to the Arweave wallet web browser extension - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/arweave-client/iplppiggblloelhoglpmkmbinggcaaoc?hl=en-US .

Does the mining reward begin now?


[14-Jul-18 08:23 AM] bitcoinBeliever&30k_by_2020#6947
By the way, any minimum requirement for the hard drive space?


[18-Jul-18 06:45 PM] ArtesianBuilds#2440
good afternoon, anyone alive in here?


[18-Jul-18 06:45 PM] ArtesianBuilds#2440
I run a GPU mining company and a client has asked about mining ARWEAVE


[18-Jul-18 06:45 PM] ArtesianBuilds#2440
I cannot find ANY information online about this


[18-Jul-18 06:46 PM] ArtesianBuilds#2440
what's the recommended hardware, where is the wallet? What exchanges is it on?


[18-Jul-18 06:46 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Arweave is cpu mined


[18-Jul-18 06:46 PM] ArtesianBuilds#2440
what algo?


[18-Jul-18 06:46 PM] ArtesianBuilds#2440
how is it impossible to google this?


[18-Jul-18 06:46 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Not on exchanges yet


[18-Jul-18 06:46 PM] ArtesianBuilds#2440
fair


[18-Jul-18 06:46 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Private info mosty


[18-Jul-18 06:46 PM] ArtesianBuilds#2440
fascinating


[18-Jul-18 06:46 PM] Vilenarios#8742
They have a mailing list @arweave-india


[18-Jul-18 06:46 PM] ArtesianBuilds#2440
most of my clients don't ask for private coins like this


[18-Jul-18 06:46 PM] Vilenarios#8742
It’s rather unique


[18-Jul-18 06:46 PM] Vilenarios#8742
And has unique requirements too


[18-Jul-18 06:47 PM] ArtesianBuilds#2440
so.... is a multi-CPU xeon system able to mine any better than a generic i7?


[18-Jul-18 06:47 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I hope your miners have lots of storage and multi core cpus


[18-Jul-18 06:47 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Unknown


[18-Jul-18 06:47 PM] ArtesianBuilds#2440
we build multi-million dollar hardware installations  


[18-Jul-18 06:47 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Still need benchmarks


[18-Jul-18 06:47 PM] ArtesianBuilds#2440
ok...


[18-Jul-18 06:47 PM] ArtesianBuilds#2440
so is anyone mining it yet?


[18-Jul-18 06:47 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I think plenty


[18-Jul-18 06:47 PM] ArtesianBuilds#2440
We can build a quaint little 30TB server with quad xeons if we need to


[18-Jul-18 06:47 PM] Vilenarios#8742
But no mining rewards yet


[18-Jul-18 06:47 PM] ArtesianBuilds#2440
O_o


[18-Jul-18 06:48 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Ya go for it man I’m sure they would love the testing


[18-Jul-18 06:48 PM] ArtesianBuilds#2440
this client has surely chosen a strange horse in the race


[18-Jul-18 06:49 PM] Vilenarios#8742
1 billion in ICO interest... raised only like 9 million or something... so the hype is real for arweave.


[18-Jul-18 06:49 PM] Vilenarios#8742
So I imaging your client wants to get some nice AR rewards before all the mining details become perfect and consumable for he masses.


[18-Jul-18 06:52 PM] ArtesianBuilds#2440
i sent a long email to the company


[18-Jul-18 06:52 PM] ArtesianBuilds#2440
maybe they'll reply


[18-Jul-18 06:52 PM] ArtesianBuilds#2440

Hello! Does anyone know what the ICO price was?


[18-Jul-18 08:59 PM] ArtesianBuilds#2440
@thegoat19 give me an MPN and A quantity and I’ll see what I can see


[19-Jul-18 04:33 AM] arweave-india#5075
@Căpitanu - It was £0.55 GBP per token, which is around $0.72 USD I believe


[19-Jul-18 04:33 AM] arweave-india#5075
@ArtesianBuilds I'm just replying to your email now. Looks like you haven't found some of our resources or joined our mining mailing list for information yet, so I'll link to everything in the email for you


[19-Jul-18 04:33 AM] arweave-india#5075

@thegoat19 We do not encourage price speculation here, this platform is primarily for developer & mining discussions, and project progress, use cases, etc., not trading. Thanks very much.

[25-Jul-18 01:17 PM] Puck342#3354
It was nice seeing the email today, though it was disappointing that there was no mention of access to liquidity, or even that getting listed was a priority for the team


[25-Jul-18 07:08 PM] Patziggy#9371
IMO moving away from the Google chrome extension wallet should be considered: https://twitter.com/AugurProject/status/1022186967432192000

Google has consistently proven themselves to be anti-open source and today again proven they actively work against user security


[26-Jul-18 01:34 AM] cavkie#9835
Hi, can someone share instructions for mining, please?


[26-Jul-18 02:11 AM] codybartfast#9308
@Jesper | UMA, @cavkie   to start mining  please email India Raybould at india@arweave.org (from your preferred email) and she'll add you to the list & send the guide to you.  I think they're doing it this way so they have a means of contacting miners when updates are needed.


[26-Jul-18 02:38 AM] cavkie#9835
yes, i did this about a month ago


[26-Jul-18 03:20 AM] arweave-india#5075
Puck - I understand, the reality is we just cannot say anything publicly, so it's tricky to give an update at this stage. We're in high level talks with a number of exchanges to us, this is an ongoing priority for us we're working really hard on. A lack of comms on this genuinely doesn't reflect a lack of progress, plus ultimately the specific timing of listings is always in the hands of the exchange(s) themselves, rather than the project getting listed. Additionally, as you might anticipate, implementation of a new token requires work from both sides for the implementation, and then extensive testing is also really important to ensure the implementation is perfect and there is no chance of any unexpected behaviour/bugs. Thank you for your patience, I understand you guys want as much information as possible.


[26-Jul-18 08:52 AM] JamJam 17#3072
Sorry if this is not the right place to ask. But, I am looking to buy Arweave Otc. Does anyone know a good place to find seller?


[27-Jul-18 12:05 PM] Puck342#3354
"We're in high level talks with a number of exchanges to us, this is an ongoing priority for us we're working really hard on." <-- This is all that I was looking for, thank you.

I know first hand how NDA happy exchanges are and how difficult it can be to integrate a unique blockchain with an exchange's back-end. I wouldn't be so foolish as to ask for an exchange name or a date or anything specific. Just a confirmation that it's still being worked on, thank you!


[27-Jul-18 02:12 PM] 2072 [ANFRA]#9291
@arweave-india in September 2017 I remember that early participants could add pages to the archive and a small text, I remember archiving "The Last Question" by Isaac Asimov, but I don't remember which page I archived (either http://www.multivax.com/last_question.html or  https://www.physics.princeton.edu/ph115/LQ.pdf) is there any way to check?


[27-Jul-18 03:02 PM] codybartfast#9308
@2072 [ANFRA] With the current Chrome extension you can  see any pages you've archived with that instance of the extension (it's on the options page).  But I don't know about earlier, test clients.

If you have the original wallet address then I think all the data about its transactions is on the block chain so the information is there to be found, but I don't think there are generally available tools do that yet.  I think I read future versions of the Chrome extensions will be able to list all transactions of a wallet and not just those from that particular extension.


[27-Jul-18 05:59 PM] 2072 [ANFRA]#9291
thanks @codybartfast, unfortunately the original wallets are incompatible with the current network version (the keys format was changed) so maybe what had been done then is lost now due to the multiple network resets that occurred before the recent main-network launch...


[27-Jul-18 06:16 PM] Puck342#3354
if one needed to contact Upvest because of something being quite odd with the wallet, how would one go about that


[28-Jul-18 12:24 AM] codybartfast#9308
@Puck342  users usually get pointed to Upvest's Telegram channel: https://t.me/joinchat/FPkAjlJp2SuQjJzfUe0S_g


[28-Jul-18 12:33 AM] codybartfast#9308
@2072 [ANFRA] Yea, this morning, like most mornings, I woke up thinking "duh!" different network.  I hope you don't mind that I've put them on the main net:  http://159.65.213.43:1984/tx/ldoaD2NbG9VRhLOXddM1ypoAU3W5gR_zabUWZa4r6lM/data.html, http://159.65.213.43:1984/tx/rY4cJeAtYkg3bnTdqk4Vb0ojEcfS76L4B-iqyvQZ2VA/data.html

@arweave-india It would be super awesome if the dev team was able to put out a weekly or bi-weekly update on the project's progress.  Goals, developments, current priorities, etc.  Even if it is brief, it's nice to have some news from time to time.

@Embiei|MassStake The value of storage is designed to be roughly static (in dollar amount), and related to the size of data being stored. This means that even though the Arweave token may change in its value, it should cost approximately the same dollar value to archive 1MB, though what number of tokens it costs may change, for example.


[05-Sep-18 04:32 AM] arweave-india#5075
@Lasse Clausen Thanks - I've sorted that out now  


[05-Sep-18 04:40 AM] Embiei|MassStake#8665
@arweave-india Thanks India


[05-Sep-18 04:42 AM] Embiei|MassStake#8665
I guess that the economics are not public, but i was wondering how you set the 0.74$ per Arweave coin at the ICO


[05-Sep-18 04:49 AM] arweave-india#5075
@Embiei|MassStake I wasn't personally involved in the process myself, but from my understanding it was reached from a number of factors, including number of tokens available, funding goal (for runway), and a series of consultations with blockchain & crypto industry experts


[05-Sep-18 04:50 AM] arweave-india#5075
Re: the economics, it was a private-invite only sale with all details available to those invited to participate, hence no public release as the sale was private


[05-Sep-18 05:00 AM] Embiei|MassStake#8665
Nice, thanks for your time


[05-Sep-18 05:01 AM] Embiei|MassStake#8665
lets see what happens when the rewards are activated for the minners and the token reachs an exchange

Hi @arweave-india  How many tokens are available ? I m sure you have answered that many times, sorry fro that


[06-Sep-18 04:35 AM] arweave-india#5075
@juliosaa In total there will be 66 million AR tokens - 55 million of those are in the genesis block, and another 11 mil are released as mining rewards over time


[06-Sep-18 04:35 AM] arweave-india#5075
Happy to answer questions, even if they've been covered before

someone over Telegram asked about Asia coverage, do you have any plans? partnerships? conferences?


[06-Sep-18 04:38 AM] arweave-india#5075
@tiamat At the moment nothing announce-able in the very near future. Our CEO has attended some Asian conferences, including in South Korea a few weeks ago, and we have had a few significant Asian participants in our institutional token sales, but I think Arweave & our CEO is currently better known within Europe so is invited to *speak more frequently at events on mainland Europe than elsewhere (though there have been some US appearances, naturally)


[06-Sep-18 04:40 AM] arweave-india#5075
Though growth outside of Europe is on our radar for the future, and part of our expanding team will include new growth responsibilities for some new hires

[12-Sep-18 08:45 AM] rehash#3438
Unfortunately I have to sell half of my AR tokens(~9000).  PM me if interested, same price as ICO.

@arweave-india  Do you consider doing something like Mainframe did with Proof of Freedom ? It was a huge success and they got lot of attention.

[26-Sep-18 12:48 AM] codybartfast#9308
@uno, I think the only instructions today are the ones for getting started as a miner, the official way to get those is to email team@arweave.org,  there's just been a big code update (N.1.5.0.0-BETA-1) that may not be reflected in the mining guide yet, but you can find out more in the mining forum.

Can we currently mine arweave token (the real token)? How many token could I mined per day with a nvdia quadro fx   1800...sory for the newbie question!


[28-Sep-18 03:39 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hi @kryptofun ! Welcome!

So, yep, you can currently get your mining set up on our main network which is running. However, there are currently no block rewards available to miners (the inflation schedule hasn't started yet, and will not until block height 65,700)  - we call the current stage the 'soft onboarding' stage, and it's basically just a period to let miners all get their setups ready for block rewards, and then of course you can shut down your setup until 65,700. 

If you drop me an email at team@arweave.org I'll send you a copy of the mining guide, and add you to the mining-specific mailing list for future updates & to ensure you're informed when the inflation schedule begins


[01-Oct-18 07:30 AM] thegoat19#8424
what tpye of mining is it @arweave-india  ? GPU or Hard Drive?


[01-Oct-18 07:31 AM] arweave-india#5075
@thegoat19 To quote from our 'getting started' mining guide: "Is CPU or GPU mining more effective?

 
The hashing algorithm used underneath the proof of access mechanism in the Arweave is SHA2-384, for which the CPU is the most efficient miner currently available."


[01-Oct-18 07:32 AM] arweave-india#5075
Also perhaps this part is of relevance too: 

"What factor (hard drive space/hashing power/network connection) should I optimise for?

 
Because of the way that the Arweave proof of access system works, miners are favourably rewarded for offering hard drive space above raw hashing power. Efficient miners will optimise on this variable first. Hard drive space will become an increasingly important part of the mining process as more data is stored in the system. However, the most efficient miners in the Arweave network will combine all three categories: hard drive space, bandwidth, and computational power."


[01-Oct-18 07:32 AM] arweave-india#5075
Just drop me an email if you haven't got a copy of the guide already, at team@arweave.org


[01-Oct-18 07:39 AM] thegoat19#8424
Ok thanks @arweave-india  also whats the current OTC price

@thegoat19 As we strongly(!!) discourage OTC selling, we also discourage OTC discussion here


[01-Oct-18 07:42 AM] arweave-india#5075
It's too risky for all parties involved unfortunately.

any news about listing AR in any exchange any time soon?


[18-Oct-18 04:40 PM] Marcin#0065
i just wonder about the wallet file. i generated a new one. i could copy the file to another pc, and load in into the extension. i was able to setup a password.
does that mean, everyone who grabs a json wallet file is able to load it into the web extension and send tokens? arent the wallet files encrypted in first place? am i missing something?


[18-Oct-18 07:18 PM] patrick#8648
Afaik you can set a password on the extension after u loaded it. This is only to stop people from using the extension on ur browser when ur away


[18-Oct-18 07:18 PM] patrick#8648
So the wallet file itself is not encrypted


[18-Oct-18 08:56 PM] ATLAS#7218
Yeah its not. You can encrypt yourself tho ^^


[18-Oct-18 10:17 PM] ATLAS#7218
When did the private sale tokens unlock?


[19-Oct-18 04:33 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hi 🅑🅐🅩 - All tokens unlocked not long after mainnet launch, though I would have to double check if you wanted the exact date


[19-Oct-18 04:45 AM] ATLAS#7218
The reason for locking is to preventing mass dumping or market manipulation before the market matures.


[19-Oct-18 04:46 AM] ATLAS#7218
But at this point, its same as having no lockup at all

As we've explained before, we simply don't allow price discussion here - it encourages OTC trading which is too risky for us to condone unfortunately.

Why dont we add OTC channel in this discord? And provide some reliable escrow

There will be 2-3 trade per day probably and it wont take much time

I just know few projects which do that and it works pretty well

@arweave-india would I be able to PM you for some help? I invested in the seed round back in 2017, was wondering if you’d be able to help me convert from the old archain to the new arweave? I ask because I don’t want it to get lost with all the other DMs you get


[15-Nov-18 07:56 AM] arweave-india#5075
Heya @  Of course - I'd be very happy to help you out. It might make sense for you to drop me an email directly as that's easier to keep track of than Discord DMs. My address is: india@arweave.org. If you could email me from the email address you registered for the sale with, that would be ideal


[16-Nov-18 09:12 AM] Mike#2447
I received the following information from the OTC trading desk.  17 hours have now passed, so this may no longer be accurate.  I assume 0.25c means $0.25 and not $0.0025.

"For transparency, right now the last 2 transactions have gone through at 0.25c and 0.24c USD, which is just above the ETH/USD ratio from the token sale."


[16-Nov-18 11:09 AM] thegoat19#8424
Wuh? @arweave-india


[16-Nov-18 11:10 AM] thegoat19#8424
almost 1/3 the ico?


[16-Nov-18 11:12 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Eth has gone down quite a bit since token sale


[16-Nov-18 11:19 AM] thegoat19#8424
lol... so ..


[16-Nov-18 01:23 PM] Mike#2447
I have to agree with @thegoat19 on this one.  I'm definitely more interested in the $/AR, not ETH/AR.


[16-Nov-18 01:24 PM] Mike#2447
I can also see the perspective of the trading desk being a salesman trying to run a business for profit.


[16-Nov-18 03:28 PM] thegoat19#8424
@arweave-india


[16-Nov-18 03:29 PM] mec1988#6670
I'm pretty sure there isn't going to be and probably shouldn't be discussion of the current otc price with the team.


[16-Nov-18 03:30 PM] Mike#2447
Right.  As was said, it's going to be driven by market conditions.


[16-Nov-18 03:31 PM] Mike#2447
They're just matching sellers with buyers.


[16-Nov-18 03:31 PM] arweave-india#5075
Yes, it's not my position (and against our general guidance for our official discussion platforms) to discuss pricing of tokens. Those who want to use the trading desk will be informed of the two most recent sale prices by Sonar to help provide more transparency and context. Mike is correct, Sonar are just matching sellers with buyers.


[16-Nov-18 03:32 PM] Mike#2447
There was no indication to not disclose the prices offered, so I thought I would share my experience with the community.


[16-Nov-18 03:33 PM] arweave-india#5075
That's okay Mike, I was just clarifying why I won't be discussing price myself, nor will other members of the team.


[16-Nov-18 03:41 PM] Roman#2713
Why not create a separate channel in the Telegram or Discord to discussing prices?
And if the seller and the buyer have agreed on everything is already used Sonar OTS


[17-Nov-18 02:11 AM] ATLAS#7218
Whats the current supply?


[17-Nov-18 02:22 AM] ATLAS#7218
Around 200k AR should be mined since launch. But not sure how much the initial supply was


[17-Nov-18 03:52 AM] tiamat#9131
100k was mined


[17-Nov-18 03:53 AM] tiamat#9131
and 6 months gone already, so we'll have a lot for the remaining 6 months according to whitepaper


[17-Nov-18 03:56 AM] ATLAS#7218
we mined 20k block so it should be at least 140k


[17-Nov-18 03:57 AM] tiamat#9131
(83,936 - 65,700) * 7


[17-Nov-18 03:57 AM] ATLAS#7218
and there was low reward for 65700 block


[17-Nov-18 03:58 AM] tiamat#9131
under 100 AR  


[18-Nov-18 01:08 AM] Massimiliano#2834
Hi @arweave-india  and other fellow miners; may I ask what is the minimum requirements in terms of data storage available to mine AR?
Any suggestion on data storage to dedicate to increase chances of mining?


[18-Nov-18 02:24 AM] tiamat#9131
Right now I think you will be fine with 50 GB, as we are in the early stages, Bandwidth and CPU are more important in this moment.


[18-Nov-18 02:46 AM] Massimiliano#2834
Thanks. I thought I would beed st least few hundreds GB


[18-Nov-18 02:47 AM] Massimiliano#2834
Any suggestions for optimal CPU configuration? Would be really appreciated


[18-Nov-18 03:03 AM] tiamat#9131
It's hard to calculate an optimal config since we don't know the real value of AR, just get as many cores as you can afford  


[19-Nov-18 01:06 AM] ggbb777#2026
can   any1   tell if data on   viewblock.io   is   correct


[19-Nov-18 06:36 AM] arweave-india#5075
@ggbb777 It should indeed be yes, what information are you wanting to check? Feel free to PM if you prefer


[19-Nov-18 06:43 AM] ivhturp#3325
Hey, How does Sonar work? Are the transactions paid in ETH or bank transfer? And are there any restrictions w.r.t countries


[19-Nov-18 08:39 AM] ggbb777#2026
@arweave-india    DATA STORED  177.77 MB   - is this real qty of alldata stored  on servers?


[19-Nov-18 09:25 AM] arweave-india#5075
@ggbb777 Yes that seems correct - it's small at the moment but we're in a very early adoption stage currently so there isn't a huge amount of data there, despite the capacity to accommodate a lot more


[19-Nov-18 09:39 AM] ggbb777#2026
ok , thanks for clarification


[19-Nov-18 09:39 AM] ggbb777#2026
hope we will hit  TBs soon

[22-Nov-18 01:07 AM] mike123#1768
does arweave use sha-256 mining algo along with PoA... i think the old whitepaper used to say that, but i can't figure out what it uses now


[22-Nov-18 03:03 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@mike123 The PoW part is using SHA384.


[22-Nov-18 09:57 AM] ATLAS#7218
Minimum order size for OTC is 10k$. Need like 20k AR to trade. Dayum.


[22-Nov-18 01:12 PM] Marcin#0065
Pls just stop doing that. Either get listet on an exchange or not. But that whole "official partner otc" is just confusing


[22-Nov-18 01:26 PM] Marcin#0065
Furthermore, that minimum amount of 10k is excluding a lot of the people, since the ico was limited to few ether for a lot people. 
You giving the impression of a "rich exclusive" otc club in here. 
Im totally dissapointed by that move and will reconsider to move on to another project, if that kidn of decisions will continue.


[23-Nov-18 07:29 AM] cavkie#9835
yes, OTC offer is just slap in the face for most people here


[23-Nov-18 08:04 AM] Goldfinger#4647
OTC looks like attempt to get tokens with huge discount before listing on exchange


[23-Nov-18 08:11 AM] ATLAS#7218
It is cheap because people are willing to sell at that price


[23-Nov-18 08:12 AM] ATLAS#7218
Don't be that deluded just because your moonshot is trading below ico smh


[23-Nov-18 09:28 AM] tiamat#9131
sooner or later it will list on exchange, but some impatient folks will sell cheap to some whales with this OTC option


[23-Nov-18 09:30 AM] Goldfinger#4647
anyway pre-ICO price is lower then OTC


[23-Nov-18 09:32 AM] tiamat#9131
maybe but those guys will wait for much longer and they had more uncertainties


[23-Nov-18 09:37 AM] nett8#3527
How we can sell with OTC, if minimum order size is 10,000$?


[23-Nov-18 09:46 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Hey guys, if you've any questions about the OTC desk, feel free to drop us a line at team@arweave.org (or DM) and we'd be happy to discuss  


[23-Nov-18 01:08 PM] Goldfinger#4647
@nett8  why sell, buy OTC, it's just 10K$ 


[27-Nov-18 06:16 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Hey @ATLAS, unfortunately this isn't a platform for buying or selling AR and we'd like to keep conversations focused on tech and the development of Arweave. We also want to keep our community safe from potential scams associated with public sales offerings via social platforms. Thanks for understanding! 🙏


[27-Nov-18 06:37 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
We really appreciate your support towards the project and never underestimate the value of community members such as yourself @ATLAS. With regards to trading across social platforms — we see numerous attempts from unsolicited accounts asking people to give up sensitive information or download corrupted files, therefore our guidelines are really a measure of looking out for our community and keeping them safe from potential harm. 

We do hear your feedback and if you would like to discuss anything further, drop me a line via DM or team@arweave.org and I’d be more than happy to help 👾


[27-Nov-18 06:47 AM] ATLAS#7218
I've sent you a DM.

hello, I would like further assistance retrieving my arweave tokens


[28-Nov-18 11:12 PM] information-corp#0984
i have emailed in the past, sometimes with reply, and sometimes without


[28-Nov-18 11:13 PM] information-corp#0984
if one of the team could contact me, that would be appreciated. thank you


[29-Nov-18 01:33 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hey @information-corp Sorry to hear you still need assistance, we'd be very happy to help of course. Although we make every effort to ensure no community queries go unanswered, we're sorry if we missed a message from you. Please can you DM me the subject line of the email and the address it was sent from so I can look into this for you? Of course, we'll be happy to help you access your tokens.


[29-Nov-18 10:41 PM] ATLAS#7218
Where can I find info about current supply?


[30-Nov-18 03:44 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I think Viewblock might have that?


[01-Dec-18 01:07 AM] ATLAS#7218
They don't have any.


[02-Dec-18 03:20 PM] tierralibre#2740
Hola! What was the unit of AR how many decimals?


[02-Dec-18 03:21 PM] tierralibre#2740
I saw it somewhere but I don't seem to find it.


[02-Dec-18 03:21 PM] tierralibre#2740
was it like 10 for 1 AR


[03-Dec-18 04:25 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Hey @ATLAS, if you're talking about mining rewards - that's currently around 200k .


[03-Dec-18 04:30 AM] ATLAS#7218
No. Total supply - vested amount - to be mined


[03-Dec-18 05:20 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
The answer to your question @tierralibre: 1 AR = 1000000000000 Winston (12 zeros) and 1 Winston = 0.000000000001 AR

I am sharing arweave with normal people


[03-Dec-18 07:51 AM] tierralibre#2740
what would be the best way to see the transaction data as an image


[03-Dec-18 07:51 AM] tierralibre#2740
it was a png


[03-Dec-18 07:51 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I love how they are called Winston

{Reactions}
❤ 

[03-Dec-18 07:51 AM] tierralibre#2740
is it base64 encoded?


[03-Dec-18 07:51 AM] tierralibre#2740
it was uploaded with the tool from url


[03-Dec-18 07:52 AM] tierralibre#2740
I mean to show case it. I need  to show look we store and here we can retrieve it


[03-Dec-18 07:52 AM] tierralibre#2740
but something they can see not binary  


[03-Dec-18 07:53 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
No problem. That's great to hear, thanks for your support 🙏


[03-Dec-18 07:54 AM] tierralibre#2740
so how would one retrieve an image?


[03-Dec-18 07:54 AM] tierralibre#2740
I am getting the data field which I assume is base64 is this correct?


[03-Dec-18 08:00 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
@tierralibre yeah the data field is base64url encoded


[03-Dec-18 08:00 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
So you would just encode your image to b64 before sending to the network  


[03-Dec-18 08:00 AM] tierralibre#2740
I  used your archiver


[03-Dec-18 08:00 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
The current web archiving wallet does this for some images for example


[03-Dec-18 08:01 AM] tierralibre#2740
<div>
    <p>Taken from wikpedia</p>
    <img src="data:image/png;base64, http://erm.earth:1984/tx/R0yFJxRZkeDBY5JC3aoKgTwRqI6TJzECziYSt619ghI/data" alt="Red dot" />
</div>


[03-Dec-18 08:01 AM] tierralibre#2740
I tried this what did not work


[03-Dec-18 08:01 AM] tierralibre#2740
maybe I have to load the data first to js


[03-Dec-18 08:03 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Oh yeah, you would need to convert the image to b64 first in JS and replace the url with the base64 string


[03-Dec-18 08:07 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Here's a real example of what it should look like arweave.net/KiN5dr28NK4YAhNk_vgDJvXT7M3b7MtdmYJqylLZaD4

If you view the source on this page and ctrl+f for 'data:image' you'll see a bunch of images


[03-Dec-18 08:22 AM] tierralibre#2740

What's in the transaction? Is it just a PNG image?


[03-Dec-18 08:32 AM] tierralibre#2740
is a raw image from github stored

How did it get uploaded?


[03-Dec-18 08:32 AM] tierralibre#2740
with the  wallet


[03-Dec-18 08:32 AM] tierralibre#2740
went to here: and clicked archive


[03-Dec-18 08:33 AM] tierralibre#2740

[03-Dec-18 08:33 AM] tierralibre#2740
and clicked archive in that url


[03-Dec-18 08:38 AM] tierralibre#2740
maybe the standard archive does other things when using the url


[03-Dec-18 08:38 AM] tierralibre#2740
is there a tool to arhive directly to the weave?


[03-Dec-18 08:39 AM] tierralibre#2740
binary files?


[03-Dec-18 08:39 AM] tierralibre#2740
maybe I can use that?


[03-Dec-18 08:44 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Ah gotcha, so yes at the moment the web archiving is setup for html and can embed assets inline, but it's not currently setup to upload binaries directly


[03-Dec-18 08:44 AM] tierralibre#2740
ok, so I will archive a html page with img


[03-Dec-18 08:44 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Have you got a bunch of stuff you need to upload, or is it just the one image for now?


[03-Dec-18 08:44 AM] tierralibre#2740
that will be easier


[03-Dec-18 08:44 AM] tierralibre#2740
Is just one image to show as a PoC


[03-Dec-18 08:45 AM] tierralibre#2740
I want  to show that we can integrate our ERM with Arweave


[03-Dec-18 08:45 AM] tierralibre#2740
to the business people


[03-Dec-18 08:45 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Yeah it would work fine in a browser, but then you won't be able to use it as an actual image if that makes sense?


[03-Dec-18 08:45 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
It's possible to upload if you know some erlang from your node directly


[03-Dec-18 08:45 AM] tierralibre#2740
yes, after I will build an api so the server can handle this

so I don't have to expose they keys


[03-Dec-18 08:47 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
If you shell into a node and attach to the screen session you can run this to  upload raw binary data
```
W = ar_wallet:load_keyfile("key.json"),
Queue = app_queue:start(W),
UnsignedTX = #tx { tags = [{"Content-Type"}, "TYPE"}], data = <<"DATA">> },
app_queue:add(Q, UnsignedTX).
```


[03-Dec-18 08:48 AM] tierralibre#2740
now that is cool


[03-Dec-18 08:49 AM] tierralibre#2740
all this I can call form elixir too right


[03-Dec-18 08:49 AM] tierralibre#2740
what is app_queue?

There are some apps that are bundled that work as sample/reference integrations


[03-Dec-18 08:51 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
This one will upload a bunch of transactions for you  


[03-Dec-18 08:52 AM] tierralibre#2740
It would be really great to expose this as a package if possible. Or see how this can be called from elixir


[03-Dec-18 08:52 AM] tierralibre#2740
elixir can call any erlang functions


[03-Dec-18 08:52 AM] tierralibre#2740
out of the box


[03-Dec-18 08:52 AM] tierralibre#2740
thank you for that


[03-Dec-18 08:52 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Np!  


[03-Dec-18 09:36 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@tierralibre Because the queuer needs a running node in order to post, I *think* that you will need to run it from an Erlang terminal at the moment, I am afraid\


[03-Dec-18 09:37 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Theoretically I guess you could compile Arweave, then start elixir with the equivalent of `era -pa ebin/`, then call the initialisation functions from the shell


[03-Dec-18 09:39 AM] arweave-sam#9630
After you could run something pretty close to the above on the shell and it should work


[03-Dec-18 11:48 AM] tierralibre#2740
but a gen server could be built to expose it no?


[03-Dec-18 11:49 AM] tierralibre#2740
I could have another node connected to this one and message passing to each other


[03-Dec-18 01:37 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep, either of those could work!

Good morning! i have a questions for miiners... Are there some addresses obtaining all blocks or it is widely distributed? So, it is worthy to start mining (i am not saying profitable because the price is still unkown), i just want to know if i will get any block reward or there are some miners which gets all the rewards


[04-Dec-18 03:39 AM] Embiei|MassStake#8665
As happens in other projects, as Block Colliders, which all blocks are being minned by 4-5 minners


[04-Dec-18 03:40 AM] Embiei|MassStake#8665
(or it was some months ago)

Hey, I've just noticed that I think the size of that image is too large (there's currently a per tx size of 3MB)


[04-Dec-18 08:45 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Do you want the HTML uploading too or is it just the image you're interested in? Did you have any luck with the erlang binary upload?


[04-Dec-18 08:46 AM] tierralibre#2740
I want the image. But this trick uploads it and makes it easy available


[04-Dec-18 08:46 AM] tierralibre#2740
Not with the Erlang. I needed a quick fix. As we have something to demo tomorrow


[04-Dec-18 08:46 AM] tierralibre#2740
In the weekend I will try to  add an api to ERM to do uploads directly


[04-Dec-18 08:47 AM] tierralibre#2740
I am trying to understand how to call the erlang code from elixir. As the whole ERM is elixir


[04-Dec-18 08:47 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
If you want we can upload it for you if it's for a demo?  


[04-Dec-18 08:48 AM] tierralibre#2740
We are trying to show  http://www.africawoodgrow.com


[04-Dec-18 08:48 AM] tierralibre#2740
Here we have uploaded your proof of restoration inmutable to arveave


[04-Dec-18 08:48 AM] tierralibre#2740
and give them a link where they can see it


[04-Dec-18 08:48 AM] tierralibre#2740
that is the idea.


[04-Dec-18 08:49 AM] tierralibre#2740
We think we have a really, really solid case. Because  in restoration you need proof fo the work. And having the images inmutable is that proof. And we are doing that with arweave


[04-Dec-18 08:50 AM] tierralibre#2740
on the weekend I will write the actual integration so they can just click upload and boom is there. notarized proof of restoration


[04-Dec-18 08:51 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Neat, that's a cool use case!


[04-Dec-18 08:51 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep, that is a really cool one


[04-Dec-18 08:51 AM] tierralibre#2740
Arveave is going to be part of our Notary module   for all the images. satellite and drone.


[04-Dec-18 08:52 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I will ping you some Erlang code that you can run on the console to upload images for the demo


[04-Dec-18 08:52 AM] tierralibre#2740
thank you so much  If you can treat me like erlang neophite that would be great. including how to connect ot teh running node. In elixir  I have more experience. But erlang not.


[04-Dec-18 08:53 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Got it  


[04-Dec-18 08:53 AM] tierralibre#2740
Thank you!


[04-Dec-18 11:03 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@tierralibre I have experience of both Elixir and Erlang in case you need any help.


[04-Dec-18 11:04 AM] tierralibre#2740
What  I want to achieve this weekend is calling the queue app from elixir


[04-Dec-18 11:10 AM] arweave-martin#1169
Unfortunately you cannot just add arweave as a dependency since it's far from a standard Erlang application. We're going to make it more standardise over time, but for now you have to make sure your build system builds the arweave code and then loads the beam files when starting.


[04-Dec-18 11:10 AM] tierralibre#2740
I was thinking connecting 2 nodes with a cookie


[04-Dec-18 11:10 AM] tierralibre#2740
and then calling the erlang functions


[04-Dec-18 11:11 AM] tierralibre#2740
from my "elixir" node


[04-Dec-18 11:11 AM] tierralibre#2740
(is erlang node)


[04-Dec-18 11:11 AM] arweave-martin#1169
That's sounds like a good work-around. Good idea!  


[04-Dec-18 11:11 AM] tierralibre#2740
So I just have to figuer out how to launch arweave with the cookie settings


[04-Dec-18 11:11 AM] tierralibre#2740
once they are connected. erlang distributed magic should take over.

@tierralibre your application sounds like a great use case for Arweave. Good luck with it


[05-Dec-18 02:16 AM] tierralibre#2740
@chriscord Thank you!


[05-Dec-18 02:16 AM] tierralibre#2740

@tierralibre Awesome!


[05-Dec-18 03:17 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@chriscord Yep, we are very excited about this use case  


[05-Dec-18 03:17 AM] arweave-sam#9630
It makes a lot of sense


[05-Dec-18 03:17 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Maybe @arweave-kyle has some idea why the above does not work in Chrome


[05-Dec-18 03:18 AM] arweave-sam#9630
JS is not my favourite language either  


[05-Dec-18 03:18 AM] tierralibre#2740
it was user error


[05-Dec-18 03:18 AM] tierralibre#2740
no need arweave already makes pretty html


[05-Dec-18 03:18 AM] tierralibre#2740
I was just stack with concept from a previous test   but knowing why it does not work  always good.


[05-Dec-18 03:18 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Haha ok


[05-Dec-18 03:19 AM] tierralibre#2740
I sent the url to the project developer he is super happy. He is going to actually put the img on his website. I will communicate when is done

[05-Dec-18 03:20 AM] tierralibre#2740
But this image will be served directly from the weave  


[05-Dec-18 03:25 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Amazing!


[05-Dec-18 03:25 AM] arweave-sam#9630
That is super cool


[05-Dec-18 03:25 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Maybe drop it on # on-the-arweave when it is up?  


[05-Dec-18 03:27 AM] tiamat#9131
That is a very nice use case @tierralibre  


[05-Dec-18 03:29 AM] tierralibre#2740
I will do!

[05-Dec-18 03:02 PM] arweave-sophie#4476
I haven't @cavkie, but this is a great case for Arweave. If you find it, make sure to archive it on the weave and it'll never disappear again!


[06-Dec-18 02:54 AM] tierralibre#2740
```-cookie
This flag from release 4.3 is now obsolete. The default of an Erlang system is to read the $HOME/.erlang.cookie file when started and to set the node cookie to the contents of the user's cookie file. If no such file is found, the system will create one and it will be filled with a random string. See -setcookie. ```


[06-Dec-18 02:56 AM] tierralibre#2740
``` For two nodes to be able to communicate they must have the same shared secret called the Erlang cookie. The cookie is just a string of alphanumeric characters up to 255 characters in size. It is usually stored in a local file. The file must be only accessible to the owner (e.g. have UNIX permissions of 600 or similar). Every cluster node must have the same cookie.```


[06-Dec-18 03:09 AM] tierralibre#2740
Is there anywhere where I can see the parameters that are passed when starting up arweave?


[06-Dec-18 03:09 AM] tierralibre#2740
I would like to name my node so I can connect to it.


[06-Dec-18 03:10 AM] tierralibre#2740
I looked at the arserver command scripts but I don't see it


[06-Dec-18 03:18 AM] tierralibre#2740
```node().
nonode@nohost```


[06-Dec-18 03:19 AM] tierralibre#2740
is the current reply I have tried to use  net_kernel:start('AR'). as I read on a post but is not working.


[06-Dec-18 03:19 AM] tierralibre#2740
any ideas how can I give a name  host to a running node?


[06-Dec-18 03:19 AM] tierralibre#2740
easiest would be to pass  the param -name or -sname  to the Erlang shell on launch


[06-Dec-18 03:21 AM] tierralibre#2740
ok, got it.


[06-Dec-18 03:21 AM] tierralibre#2740
```net_kernel:start([ar01, shortnames]).```


[06-Dec-18 03:27 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@tierralibre The `erl` command is in the `arweave-server` script. Just add whatever argument you like, e.g. `-sname`.


[06-Dec-18 03:29 AM] tierralibre#2740
and it can be passed variables no


[06-Dec-18 03:29 AM] tierralibre#2740
erl $SHELL_OPTS


[06-Dec-18 03:29 AM] tierralibre#2740
if [ -t 1 ]; then
    SHELL_OPTS=
else
    SHELL_OPTS=-noinput
fi


[06-Dec-18 03:29 AM] tierralibre#2740
so I could pass -sname to arweave-server too?


[06-Dec-18 03:31 AM] arweave-martin#1169
Arguments to `arweave-server` are not passed to `erl`.


[06-Dec-18 03:31 AM] arweave-martin#1169
I think you misunderstood the `if`.


[06-Dec-18 03:32 AM] arweave-martin#1169
So just add the argument you like to the `erl` command.


[06-Dec-18 03:32 AM] tierralibre#2740
I understood by I see on the script that  the erl command has  erl $SHELL_OPTS


[06-Dec-18 03:32 AM] tierralibre#2740
so is getting whatever is that variable no?


[06-Dec-18 03:33 AM] arweave-martin#1169
`$SHELL_OPTS` is either empty or `-noinput`. It can have no other values.


[06-Dec-18 03:35 AM] tierralibre#2740
so I can put my command there


[06-Dec-18 03:36 AM] tierralibre#2740
anyway I got it. is ok


[06-Dec-18 03:36 AM] tierralibre#2740
I have the 2 nodes connected.


[06-Dec-18 03:36 AM] tierralibre#2740
now I am playing to see how I can run code from elixir directly


[06-Dec-18 03:36 AM] tierralibre#2740
which now should be no problem, thanks to erlang super powers.


[06-Dec-18 03:38 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@tierralibre Just to be clear. I'm saying you need modify the `arweave-server` file. I.e. you cannot pass in `-sname` from the command line.


[06-Dec-18 03:39 AM] tierralibre#2740
thank you @arweave-martin    I understood.


[06-Dec-18 03:39 AM] tierralibre#2740
for now I am just setting it up with the  kernel and playing on the  erlang and elixir shell.


[06-Dec-18 03:42 AM] tierralibre#2740
I guess this should work


[06-Dec-18 03:42 AM] tierralibre#2740
:rpc.call(:"node@10.0.3.179", System, :cmd, ["ls", ["/tmp"]])


[06-Dec-18 03:42 AM] tierralibre#2740
but with the erlang name of things


[06-Dec-18 03:43 AM] tierralibre#2740
my goal is to encapsulate adding a file to the queue


[06-Dec-18 03:43 AM] tierralibre#2740
from my elixir node


[06-Dec-18 03:44 AM] tierralibre#2740
the only thing will be that most likely I am going to need a shared folder were to upload the files but that shouldb ok


[06-Dec-18 03:44 AM] tierralibre#2740
as is on the same system and the whole idea of this,. is that I don't want the keys for the wallet to be exposed via http or anyother way


[06-Dec-18 03:48 AM] tierralibre#2740
rpc:async_call(lovecraft@ferdmbp, erlang, node, []).


[06-Dec-18 03:48 AM] tierralibre#2740
this is from the learn you some erlang


[06-Dec-18 03:49 AM] arweave-martin#1169
I've only used Erlang distribution to start a shell on a remote node, so I'm not familiar with the `rpc` module or how you usually do these things.


[06-Dec-18 03:50 AM] tierralibre#2740
I am familiar with the elixir version. I will be posting the findings here. I think it can be very useful. At the end  of the day, one of the erlang super powers is this one

[06-Dec-18 04:02 AM] tierralibre#2740
it works like a charm


[06-Dec-18 04:04 AM] tierralibre#2740
:rpc.call(:"name@node", :ar_wallet, :load_keyfile, ["key.json"])


[06-Dec-18 04:05 AM] arweave-martin#1169
Good to hear! Eventually we will make it a standard Erlang app, so you just can add it as a dependency to your Elixir app. Then it will be even easier to do this.


[06-Dec-18 04:05 AM] tierralibre#2740
Yes, that would the way.  


[06-Dec-18 04:05 AM] tierralibre#2740
about the rr on the shell


[06-Dec-18 04:05 AM] tierralibre#2740
this is to load the structure


[06-Dec-18 04:06 AM] tierralibre#2740
I guess I have to call that to on my node


[06-Dec-18 04:06 AM] arweave-martin#1169
In Elixir there are no records, so I don't know how to deal with them from the Elixir shell.


[06-Dec-18 04:06 AM] tierralibre#2740
there is struct


[06-Dec-18 04:07 AM] arweave-martin#1169
That's a different thing.


[06-Dec-18 04:07 AM] arweave-martin#1169
But you shouldn't need to deal with the records unless you want to inspect them for debugging.


[06-Dec-18 04:08 AM] tierralibre#2740
ok. so if all I want to do is upload a file to the queue


[06-Dec-18 04:08 AM] tierralibre#2740
then I don't need them?


[06-Dec-18 04:08 AM] arweave-martin#1169
Just use `app_queue`.


[06-Dec-18 04:08 AM] tierralibre#2740
let me test that


[06-Dec-18 04:10 AM] arweave-martin#1169
`app_queue` is for queing multiple uploads. We're currently working on a bulk upload feature which will split a large file into chunks and upload it.


[06-Dec-18 04:10 AM] arweave-martin#1169
That's the way to do uploads larger than a few MB.


[06-Dec-18 04:11 AM] tierralibre#2740
the function of the wallet returs 2 binarys on the a tuple


[06-Dec-18 04:11 AM] tierralibre#2740
this I assume is the priv and pub key


[06-Dec-18 04:11 AM] tierralibre#2740
is this correct assumption?


[06-Dec-18 04:14 AM] arweave-lev#3466
FYI, `app_queue` is currently broken in `master` and in the current release branch. The fix is in `feature/bulk-upload-files` at the moment.


[06-Dec-18 05:03 AM] tierralibre#2740
I am trying to tranlate this one
app_queue:add(Queue, #tx { tags = [{"Content-Type", "image/jpeg"}], data = FileBinary }).
I don't unterstand this #tx { tags = [{"Content-Type", "image/jpeg"}], data = FileBinary }).
#tx is what is this like a record?


[06-Dec-18 05:04 AM] tierralibre#2740
to a :rpc from elixir


[06-Dec-18 05:04 AM] tierralibre#2740
so the queue gives me back a pid so is a process


[06-Dec-18 05:05 AM] tierralibre#2740
could I pass a map?


[06-Dec-18 05:06 AM] tierralibre#2740
it looks like tx record. with tags and data


[06-Dec-18 05:06 AM] tierralibre#2740
I  will pass a map see what happens


[06-Dec-18 05:07 AM] tierralibre#2740
I guess is a tuple in elixir


[06-Dec-18 05:08 AM] tierralibre#2740
{User, name, twitter}  %User{name: name, twitter: twitter}


[06-Dec-18 05:08 AM] arweave-martin#1169
Yes, `#tx` is a record. You need to put the data in a transaction (tx record) before you pass it to the queue. You can probably find a function that generates a #tx for you and pass it directly to the queue.


[06-Dec-18 05:08 AM] tierralibre#2740
that would be great


[06-Dec-18 05:08 AM] tierralibre#2740
if there is function for that


[06-Dec-18 05:08 AM] arweave-martin#1169
Let's move to the # dev channel


[06-Dec-18 05:09 AM] tierralibre#2740
yes sorry for the bloating

Hey @Marcin, I believe something is in the works but we can't make any time commitments right now. Some other team members might be able to better answer this for you.


[08-Dec-18 03:37 PM] tierralibre#2740
is there an idea for a search engine of shorts


[08-Dec-18 03:42 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I’ve asked Sam about that before. I think it would have to be a dapp


[08-Dec-18 03:42 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Something to index the blockweave


[08-Dec-18 04:46 PM] tierralibre#2740
because in a world of hashes I think this is important


[08-Dec-18 04:47 PM] tierralibre#2740
as well since files are hashed. maybe there should be a mechanism to know if the same file already exists


[08-Dec-18 04:47 PM] tierralibre#2740
before even archiving it


[08-Dec-18 04:49 PM] tierralibre#2740
I see arweave as the possibility of building a  new "iinternet" or at least the data storage part.


[08-Dec-18 04:51 PM] tierralibre#2740
It is a really good opportunity. To build new conventions.


[08-Dec-18 04:52 PM] tierralibre#2740
checking for the file hash existence could be a proof of work on each own. A useful one.


[08-Dec-18 04:59 PM] tierralibre#2740
as well, what is the behaviour if a node is asked for a transaction that it does not have?


[08-Dec-18 05:01 PM] tierralibre#2740
I archived some files with the wallet node, when I ask my own node, I get a not found


[08-Dec-18 05:01 PM] tierralibre#2740
is the node getting that block from somebody else?


[08-Dec-18 05:01 PM] tierralibre#2740
when asked for a trasaction that it does not have?


[08-Dec-18 05:04 PM] tierralibre#2740
as well is there a way that  my node can request specific blocks to the network?


[08-Dec-18 05:44 PM] Vilenarios#8742
All great questions  


[08-Dec-18 05:45 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Search would be very important to that new internet.


[08-Dec-18 05:45 PM] Vilenarios#8742
De duplication would be nice too


[09-Dec-18 04:27 AM] tierralibre#2740
Even , the search indexing could be a kind of PoW


[09-Dec-18 04:36 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I could imagine a world with miners focused on hashing new blocks, miners serving blockweave content and miners indexing all with different AR rewards.


[09-Dec-18 04:37 AM] tierralibre#2740
yes


[09-Dec-18 04:37 AM] tierralibre#2740
 


[09-Dec-18 04:37 AM] tierralibre#2740
maybe even the same miners, I mean if you hash it you can index it.


[09-Dec-18 04:40 AM] tierralibre#2740
I wrote a super early draft of using  the ideas of Visible Connection and Xanadocs (Ted Nelson) to the arweave.


[09-Dec-18 04:40 AM] tierralibre#2740
https://github.com/tierralibre/earthling/blob/master/internet_past_present_next.md


[09-Dec-18 04:41 AM] tierralibre#2740
as a way to fix the internet now that AR and VR is coming. Having a chance to create new AR/VR/Browser conventions.


[09-Dec-18 04:41 AM] tierralibre#2740
Super early draft, I will work on it in the next weeks.


[09-Dec-18 04:42 AM] tierralibre#2740
I have as well arhived several pages from Ted's Webpage.


[09-Dec-18 04:44 AM] tierralibre#2740
now if the weave has a way to search and documents are inmutable and distributed. It can become the core to this concept of the  how the web should be, which  came even before than the current web, but nobody has implemented.


[09-Dec-18 05:21 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Not all use cases call for “infinite” data retention.


[09-Dec-18 05:21 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Especially enterprises. They WANt their data to go away every 7 years or whatever so they aren’t permanently liable.


[09-Dec-18 06:04 AM] tierralibre#2740
that is ok


[09-Dec-18 06:04 AM] tierralibre#2740
it could be encrypted the data and then the nodes could discard it. or you could just delete the key


[09-Dec-18 06:04 AM] tierralibre#2740
to access it


[09-Dec-18 06:04 AM] tierralibre#2740
but for human knowledge


[09-Dec-18 06:04 AM] tierralibre#2740
I think that we want inmutable and linked with a context


[09-Dec-18 06:25 AM] tierralibre#2740
or there could be some transactions with a pre-defined life until x blocks. This is how NXT has been doing it.


[09-Dec-18 06:26 AM] tierralibre#2740
as well not everyhing needs to be on the weave. In ERM we have the option to archive, but not everything leaves ERM directly to arweave.


[09-Dec-18 06:31 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Pre-defined life.. I like that. Sounds smart-contractey


[09-Dec-18 06:31 AM] Vilenarios#8742
ERM is the system you are building?


[09-Dec-18 06:32 AM] tierralibre#2740
yes. Environmental Relationship Management


[09-Dec-18 06:32 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Funny, I got a system called ERM but we refer to it as Enterprise Reationship Management.


[09-Dec-18 06:33 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Harvests relationship info about you and your colleagues/customers and builds scoring models.


[09-Dec-18 06:33 AM] tierralibre#2740
yes, is get ideas from years of CRM and ERP. and bringing it into the environment. We have been talking with many projects developers, and they are starting to realize they really need it.


[09-Dec-18 06:34 AM] tierralibre#2740
most of them are ecologist, great ideas and effort. but no clear processes


[09-Dec-18 06:34 AM] tierralibre#2740
so we are puting together Scientist, Tech, Business and Investment. Into one, to make the restoration of the Earth a good profitable business.

Hello, @arweave-india : Just in case, I'd like to share this report I discovered today: https://www.blockchaintransparency.org/ It appears that most of the volume on the top 25 traded BTC pairs on coinmarketcap  is just wash trading (fake). It appears that exchanges inflate those values to justify the very high listing fees they charge... Only 1% of the volume seems to be legit. This website provides a list of the exchanges to avoid: https://www.blockchaintransparency.org/trading-advisory-list/.

Hey Hey

Hey @KeeJef


[17-Dec-18 03:00 AM] KeeJef#7523
Just watched Sam's video interview, didnt know you guys had a discord channel


[17-Dec-18 03:02 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Ah nice  


[17-Dec-18 03:02 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
In that case, welcome to our server! Here you can keep up to date on mining, app ideas, and general discussion around Arweave :arweave:


[17-Dec-18 03:02 AM] KeeJef#7523
i actually have a technical question.


[17-Dec-18 03:06 AM] KeeJef#7523
Sam said that in when a miner mines a new block they must include the hash of some random block from the past in the new block, this verifys that the Miner who mines the new block is also holding older data from the chain. My question is, can you have a situation where there is a Master node that Holds the whole arweave. he has smaller miners underneath him, when one of the miners creates a block they request from  the Master node the blockhash of the random block. In this way the smaller miners don't actually have to hold the whole Arweave. Of course it would probably be marginally slower, i think this is quite similar to how large mining operations already work where they have a single highly connected fullnode that provides the templates to the individual mining machines.


[17-Dec-18 03:07 AM] KeeJef#7523
i should read the paper again but im lazy  


[17-Dec-18 03:16 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@KeeJef  yes, this is a valid way to increase your hashing power without the need for every machine to have a lot of storage. Also, note that in order to mine a new block you need to have the whole recall block, not just its hash.


[17-Dec-18 03:18 AM] KeeJef#7523
Yes i would hope so, otherwise i could just get a list of all the hashes


[17-Dec-18 03:21 AM] KeeJef#7523
i also have a question about Wildfire, if we use this to rank nodes, doesn't this actually encourage a high degree of centrality. My node will perform much better if it is highly connected and potentially if it is in the same data center as the other arweave nodes, thereby reducing latency and getting blocks to my peers fast.


[17-Dec-18 03:22 AM] KeeJef#7523
i suppose the counter to this is that if the central point fails then i am incentivzed to have  a backup plan to keep my blocks going and receive rewards.


[17-Dec-18 03:26 AM] KeeJef#7523
Actually i suppose the main issue i see with the "Master Node" problem described above is that you will probably start to see pools, as you do in traditional mining, except in this case since a normal user cant really run a full node to verify the whole chain (too large) you will have to somewhat trust the large "Master Nodes" in the network which end up running the full archive arweave nodes. Perhaps im not seeing something here though?


[17-Dec-18 03:34 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@KeeJef interesting thoughts!

The PoW difficulty is adjusted dynamically to ensure big enough block times so that blocks have time to propagate across the network. A tiny bit of extra latency should not be beneficial enough for miners to get too close to each other.

Regarding pools, you do not have to store all the data in order to verify the weave so you do not have to trust the large node in this scenario.


[17-Dec-18 03:38 AM] KeeJef#7523
What is the block time?


[17-Dec-18 03:38 AM] arweave-lev#3466
The current time is around 2 minutes.


[17-Dec-18 03:45 AM] KeeJef#7523
Hmmm I will think some longer and make a reply

[17-Dec-18 03:53 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@KeeJef Note that Arewave is based on Proof of **Access**. If you build a storage pool which improves the accessibility of the data for the same cost, then you are improving the network and should be rewarded. The reward will be higher likeliness to be able to participate in the mining of a block.

[26-Dec-18 09:46 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Hey @thegoat19, we don't handle OTC queries. I'd recommend you contact Base58 directly. If you'd like their email address, drop me  a DM  


[26-Dec-18 06:22 PM] ATLAS#7218
Just curious. Why do you direct every question to email? Can it not be public?


[26-Dec-18 06:34 PM] arweave-sophie#4476
Hey @ATLAS, the OTC desk was a private invitation to anybody who purchased tokens, therefore being the reason why we don't publish all the details on our social channels. Of course,  anybody with the details could share this publically, but we made it clear when contacting all people who were invited, that all queries sent to us would only be dealt with via email.


[26-Dec-18 06:57 PM] ATLAS#7218
So you can buy AR only if you participated in crowdsale?


[26-Dec-18 08:36 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Well you could buy CPU, and mine AR.


[27-Dec-18 06:46 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Yeah exactly, both miners and token holders/buyers were invited.


[27-Dec-18 08:44 AM] Kevin |#2500
Yeah but the last company handling OTC was 10 000 minimum for sell order or buy order


[27-Dec-18 11:49 AM] thegoat19#8424
Yah kinda scammy imho


[27-Dec-18 11:57 AM] mec1988#6670
I don't really think it seems that way.  They're being transparent and don't want to serve as an exchange.  The coin will be listed eventually.  I do understand holding onto an illiquid asset and the frustration that brings, though.


[27-Dec-18 02:35 PM] tierralibre#2740
I think AR has more intrinsic value than any other hyped BIT* E* What*crypto*super*name*here


[27-Dec-18 02:35 PM] tierralibre#2740
It has the value of being able to store data in a fully distributed, scalable, fault tolerant, pay once access anytime system.


[27-Dec-18 02:35 PM] tierralibre#2740
To me, that is the only use case that I have heard that makes sense for a crypto.


[27-Dec-18 02:36 PM] tierralibre#2740
I still have to hear one other crypto* whatever project that actually brought value. (To me speculation is not value).


[27-Dec-18 02:36 PM] tierralibre#2740
I have been doing a lot of research and study of the creators of computers and the internet.


[27-Dec-18 02:37 PM] tierralibre#2740
And immutable distributed data storage makes sense.  A lot of other crypto's are trying to recreate a computer, but way more limited.


[27-Dec-18 02:39 PM] tierralibre#2740
And if you want to get some, you can easily set a miner in your box or in the cloud.  


[30-Dec-18 08:34 PM] Mason Black#0187
Literally all Arweave needs is a marketing campaign centered around the release of their products and a good exchange listing (Binance / Bittrex) and it will be a monumental success for investors/supporters.  Just look at what WAVES is doing.


[31-Dec-18 01:44 AM] tiamat#9131
yeah, Bittrex is quite friendly with coins that are far from securities


[31-Dec-18 02:29 PM] Marcin#0065

[31-Dec-18 02:29 PM] Marcin#0065
 


[31-Dec-18 02:30 PM] tierralibre#2740
To be honest, I could care less about exchanges. To me the actual technology is way more important than speculation.  I do understand that ----some--- (a lot of) people are there to make some cash though, nothing wrong with that  


[31-Dec-18 02:32 PM] Marcin#0065
To me an exchange listing means an open door to the world. Without the ability to buy tokens, i cannot use the product.


[31-Dec-18 02:33 PM] tierralibre#2740
Maybe it will be listed when is ready to be used by the world. Start-ups biggest risk is too much success. (Just an opinion).


[31-Dec-18 02:40 PM] Marcin#0065
I think so too. An easy GUI first, then listing


[01-Jan-19 02:32 AM] tiamat#9131
you can use the product without exchange by setting up a miner, a in 2-3 days you will get enough tokens to upload some things


[01-Jan-19 03:40 AM] Marcin#0065
Lol? Ur serious?
I hope arweave will not do that kind of marketing xD


[01-Jan-19 03:55 AM] chriscord#4741
Is there a set cost (per MB maybe) for uploading data?


[01-Jan-19 05:04 AM] Marcin#0065
The team was speaking of a set cost per MB in AR. I have even seen it in the code somewhere, but cannot tell u an exact number.


[01-Jan-19 10:31 AM] chriscord#4741
Thanks Marcin. Thinking some more about it, it may have to be market driven but we will need an exchange before that happens. I hope the team can clarify later


[02-Jan-19 02:07 PM] Mike#2447
Bittrex wants to hear that they should list Arweave.

[03-Jan-19 07:54 AM] thegoat19#8424
has anyone ever got an email back from the OTC email?


[04-Jan-19 12:25 AM] Mason Black#0187
I'm wondering does the price of AR need to be kept low for the system to function correctly or does the system automatically adjust itself for volatility in the price?


[04-Jan-19 12:28 AM] Mason Black#0187
Say it costs 1 AR per MB and an AR is valued at $0.75, if AR price rises to $1.50, will the cost per MB then change to 0.5 AR to keep a set $ price per MB?


[04-Jan-19 02:34 AM] arweave-lev#3466
There is no reliable way for the weave to know the AR price. Moreover, the demand for the Arweave storage should drive the price, not the other way around.


[04-Jan-19 02:39 AM] Mason Black#0187
Had this had no ICO and no premine then that would be a fair statement.  But you guys set a base price for AR by selling it for 75c to fund development.  So some sort of effort should be made to keep the price at or above that level correct?


[04-Jan-19 02:43 AM] Mason Black#0187
It would be done when setting the AR cost per MB, which currently it seems to me is far too expensive in AR to be able to keep that 75c floor.


[04-Jan-19 02:49 AM] Mason Black#0187
What happens when Arweave is listed on an exhange and the price begins fluctuating due to speculation, if it gets too high and you guys don't have a system in place to dynamically modify the AR cost per MB it might become too expensive to use Arweave to store anything.


[04-Jan-19 02:52 AM] Mason Black#0187
How do you guys plan to resolve this without keeping control over AR liquidity, or is the plan keeping AR off markets forever?


[04-Jan-19 03:07 AM] Mason Black#0187
Is the AR cost per MB staticly set or is it dynamic via an algorithm that includes mining etc and will keep getting cheaper over time?


[04-Jan-19 03:10 AM] arweave-lev#3466
The formula is here - https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/blob/N.1.6.0.0/src/ar_tx.erl#L204. Smaller transactions are cheaper. Also, the price goes down as the network increases (expressed as a dependency on the PoW difficulty there).

[04-Jan-19 03:19 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@Mason Black Basically, if the fiat price of AR goes up => Miners earn more in fiat => More miners are launched => The AR cost per MB decreases.


[04-Jan-19 03:28 AM] chriscord#4741
Can you please confirm the total supply and circulating supply of AR


[04-Jan-19 03:29 AM] chriscord#4741
Or point me somewhere to find those numbers?


[04-Jan-19 03:33 AM] Mason Black#0187
got it, thanks for the info


[04-Jan-19 03:57 AM] chriscord#4741
Never mind, I believe we’re headed for a total of 66 million. 55 from genesis, 11 to be mined


[04-Jan-19 04:05 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Hey @chriscord , the total genesis block supply is 55 million tokens (with additional 11mil distributed in the future as mining rewards). The circulating supply is approximately 41-42% of the genesis block tokens (so that's approximately 23 mil tokens).

Hi, how much of the 11 million tokens are mined so far?

And has anyone been able to do OTC trade successfully with base58?

I need funds to continue mining  


[07-Jan-19 12:19 AM] Mason Black#0187
@arweave-sophie  What's the breakdown of the 60% of uncirculating genesis block tokens? How many of them have they been sold to investors and are waiting distro, how many belong to the team, allocated for future sale, etc.


[07-Jan-19 01:29 AM] ATLAS#7218
@ivhturp I stopped most of my miners because I can't afford anymore.


[07-Jan-19 01:29 AM] ATLAS#7218
No liquidity. Sad life.


[07-Jan-19 05:59 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
In the first year post-mainnet launch (8th June 2018), there will be 5.5 million tokens distributed via mining rewards. Seeing as mining rewards only began in October 18’ only a small percentage of these have currently been mined @ivhturp  ⛏ :blockchain: However for more specifics, I believe some members of the #🌟mining channel have been able to roughly work this out


[07-Jan-19 06:00 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Hey, so given that the sale amounts to around 38%, here’s a breakdown of remaining tokens @Mason Black:

19.1% are for adoption incentives. This is to encourage usage of the network (institutions, museums, libraries etc), plus community developer incentives, and rewards for community members who contribute to the project in various ways. 

13% team 

2.9% advisers 

Future token sales would come from the project reserve allocation that amounts to a total of 26.5%. However, these are subject to a vesting period of 5yrs and each year, 20% of these vested tokens will be unlocked. That goes for the same with team and private sale tokens, each of these allocations are subject to various vesting periods. 

It’s also worth noting that that a lot of bought tokens have yet to be collected and are not yet in circulation.


[07-Jan-19 06:08 AM] Kevin |#2500
Sophie, what's the point to give token to team and advisers and for adoption incentives if nobody can sell them for fiat?


[07-Jan-19 07:09 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
We don’t intend the current situation to be forever, however we are a utility token @Kevin |. Token holders can currently utilise our network and contribute to our growth and development (dApps, archiving) in any way they like :blockchain:


[07-Jan-19 07:26 AM] ivhturp#3325
@ATLAS feel you bro
@arweave-sophie thanks for the info. May i know if OTC desk is operational to liquidate the tokens atm? I am afraid many miners like me cannot afford to continue mining if this situation continues. Is there any chance of AR hitting exchanges soon?


[07-Jan-19 08:16 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
No problem @ivhturp. I believe that Base58 are still accepting requests, however we don't handle OTC queries therefore i'd recommend you contacting them directly and confirming with them here - trading@base58.capital


[07-Jan-19 08:18 AM] arweave-sophie#4476

@arweave-sophie What is it you are waiting for to close on the exchange listing negotiations, better market conditions or is it a technical milestone you need to reach before listing?  Can you guys give us some insight into the decision? A contact of mine on a well known exchange tells me they are ready to list but its you guys who are hesitating on the listing.  What will it take for you guys to take the next steps?  Would appreciate some transparency here.  I'm sure many of us would agree with me; I have no problem waiting for listing if the reasoning is sound and ultimiately beneficial to us supporters, it's the lack of communication on the matter that keeps me up at night.

I shouldn't have participated in crowdsale lol. Compared to my mined rewards, they are pennies. Its sad to see that my few thousand dollars have become penny  


[18-Jan-19 04:10 AM] ATLAS#7218
If I didn't participate I wouldn't ask for exchange and mine until it hits exchange and normie miners come in.


[18-Jan-19 04:13 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I just wish arweave said “1 year lockup” or something. No one expected having to hold the tokens this long and I think that’s why a lot of ppl feeling bad about no exchange or whatever.


[18-Jan-19 04:13 AM] Vilenarios#8742
But ah well hindsight is 20/20

@ATLAS  what kind of setup do you have and what type of yields are you getting?  I'm just curious because at this point I haven't been mining. Thanks.

[19-Jan-19 10:22 PM] Mason Black#0187
Kill me I invested $350k into this mismanaged trash heap.  It's nearing exit scam levels to me.  Took the money and showed the middle finger to everyone who backed them.  They feel entitled to our money and thus have created a culture of animosity between them and their investors.  And yes I mean investors.  All these "utility tokens" that were sold to raise funds have been deemed securities by the SEC and they are starting to force teams to give back investors their money.  This is something we might want to start looking into.


[19-Jan-19 10:36 PM] ATLAS#7218
No blame. Anyone would've took part in it. This project had all the potential. But the team just didn't care about the people who gave them the money they need and showed their incompetency over the last 7 month.


[19-Jan-19 10:39 PM] Mason Black#0187
I know well connected people who have been trying to advice and push these guys towards progress in all these fronts.  They resist, ignore.   The problem is at the top.


[19-Jan-19 10:41 PM] ATLAS#7218
They did a grave mistake. Taking long enough to realize it.


[19-Jan-19 10:42 PM] ATLAS#7218
I just keep wondering. What are they trying to achieve with this long delay?


[19-Jan-19 10:44 PM] Mason Black#0187
They think if they build it and ignore everything else at the end people will come.  Wrong.  Building a community and fanbase around your product to attract users, miners, developers is #1.  Without that you have tech nobody wants to use.  These guys don't have that kind of experience.  So many traditional startups build out products that nobody wants to use.   What they didn't realize was that their most valuable asset was all their investors, they basically started out with a built-in userbase consisting of end-users/devs/miners that wanted nothing but the best for the project.  That's gone now.


[19-Jan-19 10:46 PM] ATLAS#7218
This mentality comes a lot in application startups. They think that if their app is good people will just come pouring and they all fail to gain traction.

[20-Jan-19 01:27 AM] Alexander#7837
sam is travelling the world speaking at conferences yet even early investors already lost hope in the project it seems


[20-Jan-19 01:36 AM] tiamat#9131
yeah, whole crypto lost hope


[20-Jan-19 02:01 AM] Mason Black#0187
About half mil AR, I was in an early round and also bought otc afterward absorbing from people who were getting out of the sinking ship while they could.  I was rooting for these guys, thought they had what it took to get this project off the ground, not just the tech but the community, ecosystem, and liquidity which are equally as important if not more so (just look at Tron).  I couldn't have been more wrong.  

I know for a fact Arweave could have been listed on a top 5 exchange right after mainnet and at any time since.  They deny it, but that's straight up deception/gaslighting on thier part, which says a lot about this team.  Can't name my source or give any more details but I can tell you it's not "hearsay", you can take it as fact.  Everythign was ready to go but the Arweave team stopped communications when it came time to close the deal.  It was a deliberate decision on their part.  What it looks like to me is they decided the money was better spent giving themselves fatter salaries rather than taking care of liquidity.   To this day they make fools of us telling us they are "talking to exchanges", the only truth there is that there was a talk, and they havent responded back to the exchanges in over 6 months.

An ICO is an implicit agreement between a project and its investors.  The investors agree to fund the project, and the project in turn agrees to provide liquidity for the investors.  These guys took the money and renegged on their side of the agreement.  Every post on social media they put out now is just filled with investors calling them scammers, outside of that it's just crickets.  They have almost noone rooting for them by this point, they dug their own grave, and all of ours too.   Worse of all they don't care.  Whether desensitized, cynical, entitled, inexperienced, whatever the reason, its fucked.


[20-Jan-19 02:07 AM] Mason Black#0187
I have plenty of money in unreleased projects that have growing communities and have a plan for their token economies prioritizing investor value which I don't doubt will gain considerable marketcap when the market turns.  I dont hold the same faith for Arweave.  I don't believe an AR will ever be worth anything over a tiny fraction of what they sold them for, and this is most likely by design.   Straight up theft of investor money imo.


[20-Jan-19 02:12 AM] tiamat#9131
Nobody is going to buy "unreleased top tier" if market continue like this. I wonder what those huge projects like TON are going to do.


[20-Jan-19 02:13 AM] Mason Black#0187
The market wont be like this forever, were in the boring sideways now for 6-12 months, then start of bull.


[20-Jan-19 02:15 AM] tiamat#9131
I don't know... so many projects raised money by flagging TPS, in reality it seems nobody cares really about TPS, there is this project NANO than can scale and has no fees, still it does not get adoption.

did it go on time with whitepaper ?


[20-Jan-19 05:15 AM] Marcin#0065
I have been believing in that project from the first minute.
But looking objetively on the situation, it does not look good. And people are telling that for long time. The team just keeps ignoring all hints.
I believe, when people like me start to mistrust (i still am good, but i start to question many topics already) then most of the people will do it too.
I really hope they start to talk more with the community. Thia copy paste answers are useleas. And even sophie may be sympathic, its non of use for us. No knowledge about the tech, no question can be answered. Forwarding all timr wothout results.
Machine learning could be trained with telegram input and gives bettwr admins by now xD

I just wish the 2 core team members came back and said something. It’s been too fishy that they were so active and now nothing for over a month.


[20-Jan-19 05:23 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Maybe @Mason Black is right and they are just doing traveling and living it up with those ICO dollars.


[20-Jan-19 05:24 AM] Vilenarios#8742
I can’t wait to hear Sam at the end of month at that conference. Although I imagine he will speak about the usual benefits of decentralization and permanence.

@Vilenarios no matter what team will do, people will be unhappy. Look at Block Collider, Lisk, Edenchain or any other project. People lost money and they turn on whoever they can. Basically they are doing the opposite of what they were doing last year with "just take my money" without any research or DD.


[20-Jan-19 06:12 AM] tiamat#9131
Some people hope this will not dump like every other 2018 project. I don't think it will be the case, when it will list, it will dump and finally some people can move on with their lives

[20-Jan-19 06:37 AM] Mason Black#0187
Well no one has incentive to mine any since you can't even liquidate them making them essentially worthless, price discovery doesn't work yet basically.

Its sad how they wont even comment here, Dante replaced India on telegram, he has no clue though just pasting answers. Sam isnt even in the tg group anymore (not sure about discord). i really dont like to write exit scam but when block collider communicates better than you, there is something wrong.


[20-Jan-19 11:12 AM] tiamat#9131
the problem with Block Collider is centralization, their team control all mining software and operations

Hey, to address all of your comments over the weekend:

Firstly, I understand that you are predominantly addressing the exchange situation in this thread but as we’ve reiterated in recent communication, there is progress with exchange however we are unable to release any further details at this moment in time. As soon as we can, I assure you that you will hear about it. 

With regards to Sam and India, they’re around much less on these channels because they are focusing on growth and progress in other areas of the business - hence the reason why I joined as a community manager. India is working on the DPL and has recently started working with some new organisations, and Sam is currently focusing on adoption. We also have a bunch of new exciting partnerships that we’ll be announcing over the next weeks.

Please stop accusing admins of copy and pasting answers, we reply to all of you queries as best possible, however when we are repeatedly asked the same questions regarding exchange and we have been clear that there are no new updates, you put us in a very difficult position. 

We are always open to thoughts and suggestions from our community, however, progress in this area will only prevail if communication is constructive. If you continue to use abusive language, comments, and make false accusations - this is by no means acceptable and you will be muted from the channel. 

Any technical questions to be answered can be done so in the #🌟mining and #tech-support channels, @arweave-martin and @arweave-lev are around often to address your queries. Anything that is not answered directly is always forwarded to the team by myself, and we always strive to answer your questions as efficiently as possible. 

As I say, our ears are always open in listening to the needs of our community. If you feel that we aren’t bringing you enough updates, please let us know what areas of the project you would like to hear more about. However to be clear: exchange questions will not be addressed, for reasons we’ve previously stated.

[21-Jan-19 05:55 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Hey @ivhturp, I think this might've been answered for you already in Telegram but as stated in that channel, the price of our token sale is £0.44 and £0.55 per token for the private and public sale respectively

Sure @woombash, the private sale amounts to 16.1% of 55,000,000 = 8, 855,000 :blockchain:

what was the time interval for private sale?

Yes, the private sale @DaVinci.  The 2017 round was the seed round (when we were called ARChain)


[21-Jan-19 09:55 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Not currently @Vilenarios. Everybody that was invited to participate in that round was informed of token prices at that time.


[21-Jan-19 10:12 AM] bongtron2811#1436
hmm i am investor from ARchain


[21-Jan-19 10:12 AM] bongtron2811#1436
but Arweave dont let me join the 2nd contribute


[21-Jan-19 10:14 AM] bongtron2811#1436
i have 2500 AR now but dont know feel sad or haha in this moment


[21-Jan-19 10:16 AM] tierralibre#2740
I have a really different view. I actually think that not going to exchanges in a hyped blockchain time is a good thing.


[21-Jan-19 10:16 AM] tierralibre#2740
AR has intrinsic value. Whoever supported the ICO got AR. It can be used for archiving.


[21-Jan-19 10:16 AM] bongtron2811#1436
not sure about that. if you cant do exchange, let do good marketting


[21-Jan-19 10:16 AM] tierralibre#2740
Go support any start-up see when you can make your investment liquid


[21-Jan-19 10:16 AM] tierralibre#2740
it can take years.


[21-Jan-19 10:16 AM] bongtron2811#1436
noone want to join market in bear


[21-Jan-19 10:17 AM] bongtron2811#1436
but idk how to track the project is on time or not


[21-Jan-19 10:17 AM] tierralibre#2740
you are talking as a pure speculator


[21-Jan-19 10:17 AM] bongtron2811#1436
or some milestone of project


[21-Jan-19 10:17 AM] bongtron2811#1436
maybe true


[21-Jan-19 10:18 AM] bongtron2811#1436
but if you are calling people to join the chain


[21-Jan-19 10:18 AM] bongtron2811#1436
the miners still pay the bills


[21-Jan-19 10:18 AM] bongtron2811#1436
rights ?


[21-Jan-19 10:18 AM] tierralibre#2740
I think arweave is going beyond that. It is solid scalable  technology. The only not hyped one as far as I am concerned. I think the team is working in having solid technology. Which is needed.


[21-Jan-19 10:18 AM] bongtron2811#1436
they cant live with air


[21-Jan-19 10:18 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Hey @bongtron2811, we reached our first milestone when we launched our main net two days after the final sale closed. Since then, we've continued to make progress on the stability of the network. Next week we're looking forward to sharing some awesome new partnerships and product updates with you too :blockchain: :files:


[21-Jan-19 10:19 AM] tierralibre#2740
Not on speculation. And they could have made millions going into a exchange. Yet they did not.


[21-Jan-19 10:19 AM] bongtron2811#1436
i know Sophie but i really really want more


[21-Jan-19 10:19 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
What can I help you with?


[21-Jan-19 10:20 AM] bongtron2811#1436
hmm hard to discuss


[21-Jan-19 10:20 AM] bongtron2811#1436
i am really trust in this project


[21-Jan-19 10:20 AM] bongtron2811#1436
but times make me feel tired


[21-Jan-19 10:21 AM] bongtron2811#1436
i joined from 2017, 2018 i heard and want to join to 2nd sale too


[21-Jan-19 10:21 AM] bongtron2811#1436
but now 2019 we still update and updates


[21-Jan-19 10:26 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Ah ok, I think I understand. All updates (including exchange) will be communicated via email. Are you a member of our mailing list?


[21-Jan-19 10:27 AM] bongtron2811#1436
yes ofcourse


[21-Jan-19 02:22 PM] Vilenarios#8742
@arweave-sophie It may clear things up for investors if this information was published.  Its gotten very confusing to know how many tokens  were released, at what rounds, to whom, what is mined, what the inflation schedule is, what tokens are for the team, etc.


[21-Jan-19 02:23 PM] Vilenarios#8742
But maybe this info is in the new website you are building, so ill be patient


[21-Jan-19 02:23 PM] Vilenarios#8742
It just may help stave off some of the questions that seem to endlessly hit the TG moderators.


[21-Jan-19 02:31 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Also, i love how you snuck in "we got some updates next week".  Me likey  


[21-Jan-19 05:13 PM] ATLAS#7218
@tierralibre You realize that you are speculating hard, right?  


[21-Jan-19 05:14 PM] ATLAS#7218
Its funny to see someone saying this is going to moon, why are you speculating that its gonna dump.


[22-Jan-19 02:34 AM] Mason Black#0187
Speculation is built into the game.  You can say ongoing speculation is a necessity for Arweave's promise of permanent storage.  What other reason would miners have to spend resources to mine AR if not to sell it in the open speculative market.  Surely @arweave-sam doesn't expect there to be sufficient demand for AR simply from its utility in the near or mid term.


[22-Jan-19 02:39 AM] Mason Black#0187
Hence why most blockchains that depend on miners embrace the speculative component of the space and take steps to ensure continued interest in the token economy through buy backs, staking incentives, and deep liquidity pools.  @arweave-sam insistance on ignoring this facet of the equation is cripling his project.   His long term vision is myopic.


[22-Jan-19 02:51 AM] rehash#3438
@Mason Black you sound rekt


[22-Jan-19 03:09 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
These aspects are always considered by the team @Mason Black and I can assure you that we've planned for the future, both short, medium, and long term.


[22-Jan-19 03:13 AM] Mason Black#0187
It's good to hear these things are being considered, hopefully communication on these plans will start to be forthcoming in the future.  Definitely interested to hear about them.


[22-Jan-19 03:14 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
For sure, we'll be working to bring more updates over the coming months.


[22-Jan-19 03:18 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Thanks for your feedback @Vilenarios, i'll pass your suggestions onto the team. It's sometimes tricky because of regulation and the fact that mentioned sales were private via invitation. However if there's any way we can communicate this better in the future, it's definitely something we'll consider. 

Yeah we've got some exciting partnerships and updates coming, starting from next week

@ATLAS how am I speculating?


[22-Jan-19 04:32 AM] tierralibre#2740
I am actually building software that user arweave adding code, creating value for the community. How is that economic speculation?


[22-Jan-19 04:33 AM] tierralibre#2740
did I ever say it will dump? not sure were you get that from @ATLAS not from me


[22-Jan-19 04:34 AM] tierralibre#2740
I supported the ICO, I am mining and creating value for the community. If that is your definition of speculation, then yes, I am.  


[22-Jan-19 04:37 AM] tierralibre#2740
I have trust on the team and I believe this is Earth changing, so if that for you is speculation. definition then yes not mine.  (speculation to me is investing on something for pure economic returns I invest 10 when I can get 10000 I dump)


[22-Jan-19 04:53 AM] ATLAS#7218
`I actually think that not going to exchanges in a hyped blockchain time is a good thing.
AR has intrinsic value. Whoever supported the ICO got AR. It can be used for archiving. The only not hyped one as far as I am concerned.`


[22-Jan-19 04:54 AM] ATLAS#7218
These are all speculation. Intrinsic value, hype and not listing is good?


[22-Jan-19 05:54 AM] tierralibre#2740
@ATLAS  that is an opinion. Not economic speculation.


[22-Jan-19 05:54 AM] tierralibre#2740
"I actually think" I think makes it clear the context.


[22-Jan-19 05:55 AM] tierralibre#2740
"I actually think" == personal opinion


[22-Jan-19 05:55 AM] tierralibre#2740

I can only agree, so often people get the opposite of what I mean


[22-Jan-19 09:19 AM] ATLAS#7218
Speculation itself is an opinion so your point doesnt make sense


[22-Jan-19 09:19 AM] ATLAS#7218
`Speculation is the forming of a theory or conjecture without firm evidence.`


[22-Jan-19 09:44 AM] tiamat#9131
I think he was just making some "suppositions" instead of speculating on price for profit


[22-Jan-19 10:17 AM] ATLAS#7218
Is that a nicer way of saying speculation?


[22-Jan-19 10:35 AM] Mike#2447
Whenever I hear about "speculation" in the arena of crypto, I take to mean "price speculation".


[22-Jan-19 03:40 PM] tierralibre#2740
@ATLAS  English is not my mother tongue. So sorry if my english is not perfect,. The only thing I was sharing is my own personal view.  Happy to move the conversation to Basque anytime you want  


[22-Jan-19 03:42 PM] tierralibre#2740
Baina ez dut uste ulertuko garenik.


[22-Jan-19 03:46 PM] tierralibre#2740
By the way, AR having intrinsic value is no "speculation" is fact. You can use the token to archive data. That is, the AR token has the value for paying for archival, which is a service == intrinsic value.. I don't think I ever given that service a value in monetary terms. I tried to come to its value based on objective information at hand, like the ICO prize and that was just to explain to other people outside this forum what AR is.


[22-Jan-19 03:50 PM] tierralibre#2740
And in my personal opinion, I think that Arweave is one of the only "blockchain"  technologies  
 ("blockweave" actually) that scale, and therefore is not hype, because it provides an objective and measurable service, distributed data storage which can be scaled. There is no way that all nodes in a "blockchain" network can have a full copy of the whole "database" "blocks" at planetary scale so to me a lot of other technologies, are hyped, that is what I mean.


[22-Jan-19 03:53 PM] tierralibre#2740
About "blockchain hype" just look at all the "value" that just disappeared in 2018 in the millions. If that is not hype and speculation (refer to dictionary definition 2 below) a bubble in economical terms. You can explain, objectively what is.. I hope I have clarified my view about "speculation on something " as per the dictionary definition .  And of course big disclaimer, this is just my personal opinion. Which is subjective, and by definition speculative, and follows my assumptions  I don't have  the supreme truth or a crystal ball or all the facts on anything. I hope is more clear now @ATLAS


[22-Jan-19 04:12 PM] tierralibre#2740
As mentioned, human languages have context, this is the problem, computer languages are explicit they compile or not, even though sometimes funny things can happen at runtime.  Here the definition of speculation anybody can read it. 2) is the context I used. https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/speculation


[22-Jan-19 04:12 PM] tierralibre#2740
1) "the act of forming opinions about what has happened or what might happen without knowing all the facts"


[22-Jan-19 04:12 PM] tierralibre#2740
2) "speculation (in something) the activity of buying and selling goods or shares in a company in the hope of making a profit, but with the risk of losing money"

And here archived: https://archived.earth/tx/myFtLS8qldQ5yFYqZqHm8WMp4pOakaVn1DVZ84faJD0/data.html


[22-Jan-19 07:17 PM] Vilenarios#8742
@tierralibre I love the optimism. But how do you know it can scale? Are speaking about transactions or data capacity? There are a lot of other storage “coins” that claim the same.


[22-Jan-19 07:19 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Without a true database back end, it will never scale from a data perspective. I know the team wants to do this at some point. But until that happens, in my opinion, it will not scale well.


[22-Jan-19 07:21 PM] Vilenarios#8742
There is a reason database (either unstructured or structured) platforms exist. As opposed to just throwing all files in a folder aka what arweave does now.


[22-Jan-19 11:16 PM] tiamat#9131
databases do the same, only they have some indexes for easier access of specific data


[22-Jan-19 11:17 PM] tiamat#9131
this is something that each miner will choose, keeping it zipped, plain text, sql, etc


[22-Jan-19 11:19 PM] tiamat#9131
protocol, adoption, incentivisation, those are much more important than how data is stored


[22-Jan-19 11:20 PM] tiamat#9131
I'd like Arweave to move to PoS which is more energy efficient and more secure


[22-Jan-19 11:30 PM] ATLAS#7218
tps is not that good afaik. Takes long enough without any size load and traffic.


[22-Jan-19 11:31 PM] ATLAS#7218
Takes 3-12 minutes with 0 load in traffic. Smh scalable


[22-Jan-19 11:31 PM] tiamat#9131
that's because of block times, not tps


[22-Jan-19 11:32 PM] tiamat#9131
but maybe you can make 10k txs in the same 3-12 minutes


[22-Jan-19 11:32 PM] ATLAS#7218
Maybe.


[22-Jan-19 11:32 PM] tiamat#9131
I read somewhere it can handle 5k per block


[22-Jan-19 11:32 PM] ATLAS#7218
I heard that there exists a unicorn.


[22-Jan-19 11:34 PM] ATLAS#7218
Block size does not correlate to tps at all.


[22-Jan-19 11:34 PM] tiamat#9131
block time not size


[22-Jan-19 11:34 PM] tiamat#9131
tps is not important at this point for ar, after all you only store stuff, you don't do smart contracts or things like this


[22-Jan-19 11:35 PM] tiamat#9131
there are other chains which do this


[22-Jan-19 11:35 PM] ATLAS#7218
Block time does not correlate too. You can have 5 second block time. It does not make it 100k tps


[22-Jan-19 11:35 PM] tiamat#9131
block times are random because of PoW


[22-Jan-19 11:35 PM] tiamat#9131
the same as ETH


[22-Jan-19 11:36 PM] ATLAS#7218
Ofc im talking about all avg


[22-Jan-19 11:36 PM] tiamat#9131
2 minutes I guess


[22-Jan-19 11:37 PM] tiamat#9131
but it theoretically can be reduced, nodes sync very well now


[22-Jan-19 11:39 PM] ATLAS#7218
Block time does not have anything to do with TPS. You can nearly select arbitrary number for it.


[22-Jan-19 11:39 PM] ATLAS#7218
Its mainly dependent on block propagation


[22-Jan-19 11:40 PM] ATLAS#7218
Which IMO is bad in arweave as it always forks and takes quite long to recover when the network is already small.


[22-Jan-19 11:41 PM] ATLAS#7218
If it gets big, it will probably take forever for all nodes to get the block.


[22-Jan-19 11:42 PM] tiamat#9131
nah, it sync well, only slow nodes fork


[22-Jan-19 11:42 PM] tiamat#9131
do you use vps?


[22-Jan-19 11:43 PM] ATLAS#7218
Nope


[22-Jan-19 11:43 PM] ATLAS#7218
It sync well when there is 100 nodes and 0 txs.


[22-Jan-19 11:43 PM] tiamat#9131
maybe your connection is not that good, I didn't have forks in the latest version except for a node running on a slow vps


[22-Jan-19 11:44 PM] ATLAS#7218
20MBps Fiber optic cable.


[22-Jan-19 11:44 PM] tiamat#9131
before release 19 yeah, there were forks


[22-Jan-19 11:44 PM] tiamat#9131
now it's very smooth


[22-Jan-19 11:45 PM] ATLAS#7218
Yeah you can expect smoothness from any network when there is small enough nodes with 0 txs


[22-Jan-19 11:47 PM] ATLAS#7218
You can't just say it will scale or go to 5000 tps when there is noone using this.


[22-Jan-19 11:49 PM] ATLAS#7218
If I get 12 as average txs per day. Its 0.5 txs/hour.


[22-Jan-19 11:49 PM] ATLAS#7218
This is the current fact we got.


[22-Jan-19 11:49 PM] tiamat#9131
lack of txs is a thing for every chain except btc and eth


[22-Jan-19 11:49 PM] tiamat#9131
people don't use/need blockchains  


[22-Jan-19 11:50 PM] tiamat#9131
I remember I looked into neo few months ago and it only had 40 smart contracts


[22-Jan-19 11:50 PM] tiamat#9131
and hype was peak


[22-Jan-19 11:50 PM] tiamat#9131
and only 40 sc overall entire network

[22-Jan-19 11:52 PM] ATLAS#7218
CryptoKitty. While EOS is doing spam txs and saying it can handle 2000tps


[22-Jan-19 11:53 PM] ATLAS#7218
Just hype words with no real meaning behind


[22-Jan-19 11:54 PM] ATLAS#7218
I'm just saying this thing didn't show anything in the sense of scalability.


[22-Jan-19 11:54 PM] tiamat#9131
speaking about ETH, interoperability with ETH would be very nice, because storing stuff on ETH is very expensive


[22-Jan-19 11:59 PM] ATLAS#7218
@Vilenarios True. From database perspective, blockchain is near impossible to reach at that level. But for archiving few datas, its fine if it doesn't scale I guess  


[23-Jan-19 10:31 AM] Mason Black#0187
What do you guys think of Sam's vision  "Permanent archive for the world", does the world need such a thing?


[23-Jan-19 10:32 AM] mec1988#6670
Uhh, yes.  Have you read 1984?  Just one easy example of some reasons


[23-Jan-19 10:32 AM] Mason Black#0187
Haven't read it


[23-Jan-19 10:34 AM] Mason Black#0187
What about the things that need to happen for Arweave to be permanent: Miners having an incentive to mine AR in perpetuity, which means 100 years from now peopel will want to buy this AR.


[23-Jan-19 10:34 AM] Mason Black#0187
Feasable?


[23-Jan-19 10:48 AM] mec1988#6670
That is a good question.  Here's my opinion just as an early investor and really just an observer:  I think that, if AR does succeed in getting started and getting any level of adoption, a significant number of people around the world will begin to use it.  I think that it will have staying power.  Now, as far as incentive goes, I think that that the most important incentive is the idea that you are doing good work by participating and being a steward of important historical data.


[23-Jan-19 10:49 AM] mec1988#6670
But I also think that this token has utility and value which should rise significantly if adoption does take place.


[23-Jan-19 11:05 AM] tiamat#9131
@Mason Black yes, such thing is definitely needed. If someone wants to put files up for the next 10 years, she could pre-pay some cloud/hosting but there is no guarantee that it will remain up( there can be a bug/bankruptcy/hardware fail/etc). Of course there is no guarantee with Arweave either, but at least it is an alternative.


[23-Jan-19 11:06 AM] tiamat#9131
with Arweave you also have a guarantee of data age and non-alteration


[23-Jan-19 11:07 AM] tiamat#9131
I can't think of any other project offering this, Factom had something but I'm not sure how costly and if it is ready now.


[23-Jan-19 11:15 AM] tiamat#9131
@arweave-sam how about offering an api/plugin for MD5 Checksum for sensitive software downloads? Like geth, right now I can check the md5 on their site but if someone hacks the page, they can change that as well.


[23-Jan-19 11:22 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@tiamat In a blockchain like Arweave, the nodes don't have to trust each other. Instead, they verify all data sent in between them rendering the whole blockchain immutable. In other words, if you download a file from Arweave you can verify that you got the correct data.


[23-Jan-19 11:25 AM] arweave-martin#1169
So the API is already there. But it would be great of course to have more easy to use tools for Arweave. Luckily, we're launching the Permaweb on Monday which is related to what you're asking for.


[23-Jan-19 11:31 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I think @tiamat 's point, @arweave-martin , is that the old method of cryptographically 'verifying' the integrity of a sensitive piece of software is broken. If an attacker can change the file being downloaded, they can also change the hash of the file that is displayed on the associated website.


[23-Jan-19 11:31 AM] arweave-sam#9630
It is a neat idea, @tiamat


[23-Jan-19 11:31 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Would be great if someone from the community took on implementing  


[23-Jan-19 11:32 AM] arweave-sam#9630

```Amidst this winter, many ICO teams are refusing to bear the brunt of the market & list on exchanges.  While raising with a promise for near-term liquidity, they continue to cite concerns about market conditions.  These teams are delaying the inevitable at their project's peril.

Refusing to list in a bear market in hopes for "better" market conditions represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the market cycle between $BTC & altcoins.  It may seem wise in the short term, but it will damage these projects' long-term prospects.

They are missing a simple yet powerful heuristic in crypto: the Lindy Effect.   Coins birthed in Stage 4 & Stage 0 who survive the winter & bear the brunt of extreme skepticism tend to significantly outperform in Stage 1.

Coins which launch quickly & weather the bear enjoy the effect of survival, while procrastinators fade into obscurity. Few survive, but those that do, flourish.

A small portion (<10%) of the mega-ICO projects will deliver valuable networks.  Those that delay MainNet launch & public trading the longest will be the least likely to survive long term.```

@Mason Black Exactly. I must copy pasta this to every group I'm in.


[23-Jan-19 09:28 PM] ATLAS#7218
Let it survive this market condition instead of killing from inside.


[23-Jan-19 09:29 PM] ATLAS#7218
I hate that team does not admit that they are the one who doesn't want to list


[23-Jan-19 09:29 PM] ATLAS#7218
They act like they are doing everything they can to get on any exchange.


[23-Jan-19 09:37 PM] ATLAS#7218
I heard that they declined some exchange's offer. At this point, it sounds more likely than the team's words.

@arweave-martin If you take a look at https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/ or many other releases they have checksums. Even Ubuntu packages have checksums/hashes. But all these checksums are generally stored on the same platform with the software release itself. Registering them on a immutable platform will add extra security. Now if some attacker tries to register his own checksum of the modified(backdoored lets say) version of the software, we can always check which was registered first for that file and trust that one.

Hey all,

We are currently revamping our community chat channels, prior to the official launch of the permaweb. After carefully reviewing things, we have decided to move all non-dev/tech talk from this server and from our Telegram channel to our new ‘Arweave Chat’ Discord server, which has been set up to help support more constructive and meaningful dialogues. We will be keeping this server purely for technical discussions with other miners, developers, and protocol implementers.

Please take a moment to check out the new server and its various channels: https://discord.gg/YFAdpAF. Looking forward to the general chat over there, and the continued in-depth, protocol-focused discussions on this server.

As always, we will answer any of your questions on any topic via email at team@arweave.org. 

Best regards,
-arweave-team

Okay dumb question - what is this Permaweb? I thought that was already live because you can archive stuff... store it permanently on blockweave... and view it in a web browser.


[24-Jan-19 07:13 AM] Vilenarios#8742

@tiamat Ahh, now I understand what you were talking about yesterday. You would like to verify that you have the correct node software before you run it. Our idea is to upload the releases to Arweave where you get this validation for free, but we haven't done that yet. The current release requires git access actually, so there is a blocker.


[24-Jan-19 07:23 AM] arweave-martin#1169
This is absolutely on our radar btw. We're using a very simple build system for the Arweave node with only a few dependencies, so that we rely less on external sources, like package manager etc.


[24-Jan-19 07:26 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@Vilenarios Yes, it has 'sort of' been live since the start of the network, but we are counting the 'official' release of the permaweb as when users can simply upload their web applications and web sites to the weave.

@arweave-martin Not specifically for Arweave releases, generally. Right now signatures and hashes are mostly on the same host as the package they refer to. Putting them on a completely different medium (and read-only unalterable) would be much more secure.


[24-Jan-19 07:52 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@tiamat If you store the hashes on an immutable medium (e.g. Arweave) how do people know where to look for the hashes?


[24-Jan-19 07:53 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You should host the software and the associated web page on the permaweb  


[24-Jan-19 07:53 AM] arweave-sam#9630
In which case the hash would be unnecessary


[24-Jan-19 07:53 AM] arweave-sam#9630
As the link from the web page to the software binary itself would be immutable


[24-Jan-19 07:56 AM] tiamat#9131
sure, but for large stuff or pre-releases you may want to store the hash only to save $


[24-Jan-19 07:56 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Ah ok, yes, indeed


[24-Jan-19 07:56 AM] arweave-sam#9630
That would work too


[24-Jan-19 07:57 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Embedding torrent files on the blockweave has some pretty neat properties for large software distribution


[24-Jan-19 07:58 AM] tiamat#9131
How about a platform for predictions? I have seen people doing crypto price predictions on twitter, then deleting those that didn't happen. Then they get lots of followers but in reality they are pretty much scammers.  Puting things on read-only would prevent this.


[24-Jan-19 07:58 AM] arweave-india#5075
@tiamat I think that's a really cool idea - using it as an accountability tool of sorts.


[24-Jan-19 07:58 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You get the verifiability (without the user handling hashes manually), distributed access, and it is very cheap. The problem, of course, being that when nobody is seeding, the data is gone

“However, miners in the Arweave network are incentivised to serve the permaweb by earning tokens for putting their unused storage space to work. “


[29-Jan-19 09:55 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Us miners aren’t incentivized at all at the moment due to token liquidity.

hi guys. i recently heard of arweave, just wondering if there are any apps live on the arweave network i could try?


[12-Feb-19 01:29 PM] peterk#1529
im trying to wrap my head around how the network is decentralized and works.. in comparison to something like ipfs which i understand well


[12-Feb-19 01:32 PM] peterk#1529
is it content routing based..? and how does addressing work? looks like everything runs throug hthe central gateway on arweave.net/XXX ?


[12-Feb-19 01:48 PM] peterk#1529
i got a wallet and deployed a file.. but, kinda seems pointless ... given its accessible only through arweave.net/XX a central point of failure/service

[12-Feb-19 06:36 PM] peterk#1529
how can the incentive me to pay once to store, and have permanent storage..? the infinitely growing size of the data set doesnt make sense how it could support that fee structure


[12-Feb-19 06:38 PM] peterk#1529
even if you can communicate with individual nodes, which makes sense. how about peer discovery, data distirbution, consensus system and incentive system to maintain the infiitely growing data set

permanent storage is made by a pool that gradually releases rewards

Hey @Lasse Clausen, the chrome wallet uses the wallet-1.nodes.arweave gateway/load balancer and viewblock who are external to arweave, use arweave.net (also maintained by us).


[15-Feb-19 06:22 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
They’re just different ways to connect to our arweave nodes as we’re trying a few methods out to see which work best. Your data is accessible from any node directly, you just need your transaction id and a node IP address. You can see a bunch of nodes on this peer explorer here http://arweave.net/bNbA3TEQVL60xlgCcqdz4ZPHFZ711cZ3hmkpGttDt_U

You can pick any of them and ask them for your webpage, for example 206.189.121.5:1984/vPmgw1emAM2vaKSXEalPAJufoleQHe-xgeAusK0i3M0


[15-Feb-19 06:23 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
In the chrome wallet you can actually change the node you connect to if you like, or if you run your own. Just go into the settings and you can enter an IP address instead of using wallet-1.nodes.arweave.org


[15-Feb-19 06:24 PM] arweave-kyle#4569

[15-Feb-19 06:52 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
The promotional wallets are topped up in batches so it’s normal to see this many transactions at once, after that you’ll see nothing for a while until there’s enough demand for more

Any news about a hardware wallet support?


[25-Feb-19 10:33 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Hey @Marcin, not currently


[25-Feb-19 10:49 AM] arweave-martin#1169
Hi @Marcin, I'm curious how a hardware wallet would be helpful for you. How would you use it? Feel free to message me privately.


[25-Feb-19 11:46 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Why is any hardware wallet useful? Cold storage of crypto.


[25-Feb-19 11:47 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Sure you could just take the json, put it in an encrypted ZIP and throw it on a USB.


[25-Feb-19 11:49 AM] Vilenarios#8742
But I know things like ledger do more advanced security feautures than that.


[25-Feb-19 11:59 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@Vilenarios I'm asking about you specifically but it sounds like you would use it for cold storage and not so much for signing transactions in a convenient way. Thanks!


[25-Feb-19 12:30 PM] Marcin#0065
@arweave-martin firstly its way saver. Secondly, i imagine some kind of login using a hardware wallet.
Imagine you are storing important data, secured by the key on the hardware wallet. You can access it just by using that "usb-stick-like" wallet. 

Also doing transaction with it are way more secure (see ledger nano s) by pressing a physical button.
Since we are talking about data, a simple json keyfile is not save enough (but thats a generall problem with almost all tokens). 

Question back: why is it a big problem to try applying for a hardware wallet support?


[26-Feb-19 03:39 AM] arweave-martin#1169
@Marcin I have no idea if it's a big thing or not to add support for. Sam probably knows much more about how hardware wallet support is developed.


[27-Feb-19 11:53 PM] Mazzz#1871
How many AR have been mined and what's the marketcap now?


[27-Feb-19 11:54 PM] ATLAS#7218
Is there any plans to protect early investors from miners?


[27-Feb-19 11:54 PM] Mazzz#1871
how could they do that?


[27-Feb-19 11:55 PM] ATLAS#7218
Airdrop could be 1 way  


[27-Feb-19 11:56 PM] Mazzz#1871
eh


[27-Feb-19 11:56 PM] Mazzz#1871
where are they gonna get AR for the airdrop?


[27-Feb-19 11:56 PM] Mazzz#1871
and that could anger many miners


[27-Feb-19 11:57 PM] Mazzz#1871
I think everything's fine the way it is


[27-Feb-19 11:57 PM] ATLAS#7218
Yo miners have cost of 0.02$


[27-Feb-19 11:57 PM] ATLAS#7218
But the investors paid 0.72$


[27-Feb-19 11:57 PM] ATLAS#7218
You think this is fair?


[27-Feb-19 11:57 PM] ATLAS#7218
Yeah if you're mining sure.


[27-Feb-19 11:58 PM] Mazzz#1871
I'm both an investor and miner


[27-Feb-19 11:58 PM] ATLAS#7218
If they listed without locking the investors money, sure.


[27-Feb-19 11:59 PM] ATLAS#7218
So do you think it is fair?


[27-Feb-19 11:59 PM] Mazzz#1871
in a way I think it is fair


[27-Feb-19 11:59 PM] Mazzz#1871
because you have the oppertunity to mine too


[28-Feb-19 12:00 AM] Mazzz#1871
also the mining cost isnt that low


[28-Feb-19 12:00 AM] ATLAS#7218
It is 0.02 for me.


[28-Feb-19 12:00 AM] Mazzz#1871
how do u mine?


[28-Feb-19 12:00 AM] ATLAS#7218
And I got quite a stack.


[28-Feb-19 12:01 AM] ATLAS#7218
But its getting out of hand


[28-Feb-19 12:01 AM] Mazzz#1871
I've spent $300 on cloudminers and I've got 1000AR


[28-Feb-19 12:01 AM] Mazzz#1871
well you shouldn't be complaining haha


[28-Feb-19 12:01 AM] ATLAS#7218
People mined 3months and already has more than 100k and is in top 100 address list


[28-Feb-19 12:02 AM] Mazzz#1871
How do you mine?


[28-Feb-19 12:02 AM] ATLAS#7218
300$ brought me 6000 on some expensive clouds


[28-Feb-19 12:02 AM] Mazzz#1871
wow


[28-Feb-19 12:02 AM] ATLAS#7218
After optimizing it got better but damn its taking too long.


[28-Feb-19 12:03 AM] Mazzz#1871
Granted the $300 isn't real money, it's just free trial money on azure and google cloud


[28-Feb-19 12:03 AM] Mazzz#1871
but i imagine dedicated servers are better


[28-Feb-19 12:04 AM] ATLAS#7218
People here sound just greedy at this point. Everyone wants to mine a bit more before listing


[28-Feb-19 12:04 AM] ATLAS#7218
I'm even concerned that team is secretly mining.


[28-Feb-19 12:05 AM] Mazzz#1871
Oh i imagine the team has plenty already


[28-Feb-19 12:05 AM] Mazzz#1871
probably got a few wallets in the top 10


[28-Feb-19 12:06 AM] ATLAS#7218
Theyre locked.


[28-Feb-19 12:06 AM] ATLAS#7218
But I guess we are approaching their unlock period


[28-Feb-19 12:06 AM] ATLAS#7218
Maybe they will list once their token is unlocked so they can dump all.


[28-Feb-19 12:07 AM] Mazzz#1871
I don't think they'll dump


[28-Feb-19 12:07 AM] Mazzz#1871
I trust the team


[28-Feb-19 12:07 AM] ATLAS#7218
Lol k.


[28-Feb-19 12:08 AM] ATLAS#7218
We shouldn't be relying on anyone in the first place.


[28-Feb-19 12:08 AM] Mazzz#1871
uhhh the team is litterally making the product


[28-Feb-19 12:09 AM] ATLAS#7218
This is an open source project which will be developed by a community


[28-Feb-19 12:09 AM] ATLAS#7218
Not necessarily the team.


[28-Feb-19 12:10 AM] ATLAS#7218
Sam had some bounties on issues/features and were trying to attract some community devs. Thought he is going the right way but delaying the listing is shady no matter how you see.


[28-Feb-19 12:12 AM] ATLAS#7218
I want to trust the team but the current state is just making it impossible.


[28-Feb-19 12:14 AM] Mazzz#1871
many  devs rn are delaying exchanges to protect the early investors from the bear market.


[28-Feb-19 12:15 AM] ATLAS#7218
I can see that you're new in this space. That's bs. Locking away everything to protect investors?


[28-Feb-19 12:15 AM] ATLAS#7218
Liquidity should be there to protect them.


[28-Feb-19 12:15 AM] Mazzz#1871
imagine the token goes to 10% of original value


[28-Feb-19 12:15 AM] ATLAS#7218
You think investors benefited from this


[28-Feb-19 12:15 AM] ATLAS#7218
?


[28-Feb-19 12:16 AM] ATLAS#7218
Miners benefited from this


[28-Feb-19 12:16 AM] ATLAS#7218
Now it will go 10%for sure ty to miners


[28-Feb-19 12:16 AM] ATLAS#7218
Imagine.....


[28-Feb-19 12:17 AM] ATLAS#7218
I can't believe how you think absence of liquidity benefits holders.


[28-Feb-19 12:20 AM] ATLAS#7218
I personally mined enough so I'll be fine. But I dragged few people into this and they don't have time to mine. They just burnt their money tbh


[28-Feb-19 12:20 AM] Mazzz#1871
not really


[28-Feb-19 12:20 AM] Mazzz#1871
I still think AR will be worth at least $1USD per coin


[28-Feb-19 12:21 AM] ATLAS#7218
Thats speculation


[28-Feb-19 12:21 AM] ATLAS#7218
They bought coins worth 0.02 with 0.72


[28-Feb-19 12:21 AM] ATLAS#7218
Thats a fact


[28-Feb-19 12:21 AM] Mazzz#1871
we don't know what they're worth though


[28-Feb-19 12:21 AM] ATLAS#7218
Yeah thats why there should be liquidity.


[28-Feb-19 12:21 AM] Mazzz#1871
that's speculation too


[28-Feb-19 12:22 AM] Mazzz#1871
I agree


[28-Feb-19 12:22 AM] ATLAS#7218
What is not a fact there?


[28-Feb-19 12:22 AM] Mazzz#1871
But I think there needs to be hype before liquidity


[28-Feb-19 12:22 AM] ATLAS#7218
So you're into PnD


[28-Feb-19 12:23 AM] ATLAS#7218
This is going nowhere.


[28-Feb-19 12:23 AM] Mazzz#1871
well we got nothing to work with do we


[28-Feb-19 12:23 AM] Mazzz#1871
I just believe in the tech


[28-Feb-19 12:23 AM] Mazzz#1871
and I think it blows all the competitors out of the water


[28-Feb-19 12:23 AM] ATLAS#7218
I just said having no exchange at this point is shady


[28-Feb-19 12:24 AM] ATLAS#7218
Do you disagree?


[28-Feb-19 12:24 AM] ATLAS#7218
I am not questioning your belief


[28-Feb-19 12:24 AM] Mazzz#1871
and just because other people have it better than you, while you still have it good doesn't mean the project is shady


[28-Feb-19 12:24 AM] ATLAS#7218
Or trust in the team whatever.


[28-Feb-19 12:24 AM] ATLAS#7218
Can you just answer the question?


[28-Feb-19 12:24 AM] Mazzz#1871
I'd rather have no exchange than get listed on a shit one like hitbtc


[28-Feb-19 12:24 AM] ATLAS#7218
....


[28-Feb-19 12:25 AM] Mazzz#1871
It's all about marketing


[28-Feb-19 12:25 AM] Mazzz#1871
and the exchange listing is the most important part of it


[28-Feb-19 12:26 AM] ATLAS#7218
`Amidst this winter, many ICO teams are refusing to bear the brunt of the market & list on exchanges.  While raising with a promise for near-term liquidity, they continue to cite concerns about market conditions.  These teams are delaying the inevitable at their project's peril.

Refusing to list in a bear market in hopes for "better" market conditions represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the market cycle between $BTC & altcoins.  It may seem wise in the short term, but it will damage these projects' long-term prospects.

They are missing a simple yet powerful heuristic in crypto: the Lindy Effect.   Coins birthed in Stage 4 & Stage 0 who survive the winter & bear the brunt of extreme skepticism tend to significantly outperform in Stage 1.

Coins which launch quickly & weather the bear enjoy the effect of survival, while procrastinators fade into obscurity. Few survive, but those that do, flourish.

A small portion (<10%) of the mega-ICO projects will deliver valuable networks.  Those that delay MainNet launch & public trading the longest will be the least likely to survive long term.`


[28-Feb-19 12:28 AM] Mazzz#1871
why does it damage long term prospects?


[28-Feb-19 12:28 AM] Mazzz#1871
also corrilation and causation


[28-Feb-19 12:29 AM] ATLAS#7218
You are just delaying the inevitable


[28-Feb-19 12:29 AM] ATLAS#7218
We should've survived the dump and built stronger network and community


[28-Feb-19 12:29 AM] ATLAS#7218
Who truly believes this project


[28-Feb-19 12:29 AM] ATLAS#7218
But now, more than half of the community think this project was bad.


[28-Feb-19 12:29 AM] ATLAS#7218
No community


[28-Feb-19 12:29 AM] ATLAS#7218
Dead discord and telegram


[28-Feb-19 12:30 AM] ATLAS#7218
Few miners


[28-Feb-19 12:30 AM] ATLAS#7218
With bunch of nodes


[28-Feb-19 12:30 AM] ATLAS#7218
No stream of community members


[28-Feb-19 12:30 AM] ATLAS#7218
Thats the current state


[28-Feb-19 12:31 AM] ATLAS#7218
We are just losing more trust as the time passes


[28-Feb-19 12:31 AM] Mazzz#1871
hmm


[28-Feb-19 12:31 AM] Mazzz#1871
I guess


[28-Feb-19 12:32 AM] ATLAS#7218
Took me 40 minutes to make you guess that my concern is a valid one


[28-Feb-19 12:33 AM] Mazzz#1871
wow it's been 40 minutes


[28-Feb-19 12:33 AM] Mazzz#1871
I think as long as the team is working


[28-Feb-19 12:33 AM] ATLAS#7218
Now I have to do this to everyone deluded


[28-Feb-19 12:33 AM] Mazzz#1871
and making the product better


[28-Feb-19 12:33 AM] Mazzz#1871
and what is the goal?


[28-Feb-19 12:34 AM] Mazzz#1871
so you can mine more haha?


[28-Feb-19 12:34 AM] ATLAS#7218
To wake them up from this bs


[28-Feb-19 12:34 AM] ATLAS#7218
So this community gets bigger and stromger


[28-Feb-19 12:34 AM] ATLAS#7218
Difficulty rises higher


[28-Feb-19 12:34 AM] ATLAS#7218
Mining reward gets more distributed


[28-Feb-19 12:34 AM] Mazzz#1871
higher difficulty = less distributed


[28-Feb-19 12:35 AM] ATLAS#7218
If I wanted to mine more and dump on listing. I wouldve just stayed silent and mined as hard as i could.


[28-Feb-19 12:35 AM] Mazzz#1871
as only the most powerful miners would mine


[28-Feb-19 12:35 AM] ATLAS#7218
@Mazzz ask anyone


[28-Feb-19 12:35 AM] ATLAS#7218
Thats not the case


[28-Feb-19 12:36 AM] ATLAS#7218
You have a lot of misunderstandings  


[28-Feb-19 12:36 AM] Mazzz#1871
how is it not the case?


[28-Feb-19 12:36 AM] ATLAS#7218
You would get less. Everyone will get less


[28-Feb-19 12:36 AM] ATLAS#7218
Because there is more poeple mining


[28-Feb-19 12:37 AM] ATLAS#7218
Now is that less distributed?


[28-Feb-19 12:37 AM] ATLAS#7218
Imagine 1 person mining. He will get all the rewards. And difficulty will be minimum


[28-Feb-19 12:37 AM] ATLAS#7218
Is that more distributed


[28-Feb-19 12:37 AM] ATLAS#7218
?


[28-Feb-19 12:38 AM] Mazzz#1871
no, because the miners with the cheapest electricity will dominate the landscape, it wouldnt make sense for an ordinary person to mine


[28-Feb-19 12:38 AM] Mazzz#1871
sure, everyone would get less


[28-Feb-19 12:38 AM] Mazzz#1871
but the little guys will be forced out


[28-Feb-19 12:38 AM] ATLAS#7218
More people/more distribution


[28-Feb-19 12:39 AM] ATLAS#7218
So you want to ban chinese miners?


[28-Feb-19 12:39 AM] ATLAS#7218
Wtf dude haha


[28-Feb-19 12:39 AM] Mazzz#1871
haha


[28-Feb-19 12:39 AM] ATLAS#7218
Is that really hard to get


[28-Feb-19 12:39 AM] Mazzz#1871
I get you


[28-Feb-19 12:39 AM] Mazzz#1871
but I'm speaking what will happen beyond the algorythm


[28-Feb-19 12:40 AM] ATLAS#7218
You can't prevent chinese miners


[28-Feb-19 12:40 AM] ATLAS#7218
With small difficulty chinese miners will dominate more


[28-Feb-19 12:41 AM] ATLAS#7218
Its not their fault for being efficient


[28-Feb-19 12:41 AM] ATLAS#7218
You're talking as if smaller difficulty prevents organizations taking over the hashrate.


[28-Feb-19 12:43 AM] Mazzz#1871
not at all\


[28-Feb-19 12:43 AM] Mazzz#1871
what vps do you use though?


[28-Feb-19 12:43 AM] Mazzz#1871
to rack up that many AR?


[28-Feb-19 12:44 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@Mazzz VPS?!?! Ha-ha-hah ))))


[28-Feb-19 12:44 AM] Mazzz#1871
😡


[28-Feb-19 12:45 AM] Mazzz#1871
what do you mean by that @slayer_hellraiser


[28-Feb-19 12:56 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@Mazzz That VPS will be extremely insufficient. On my server, the arweave folder is 50 GB. You also need a lot of high-speed cores, VPS can hardly...


[28-Feb-19 12:57 AM] Mazzz#1871
@slayer_hellraiser  I guess that's true, what do you use? A dedicated server?

[28-Feb-19 04:18 AM] ATLAS#7218
@arweave-sophie GRIN is based on brand new privacy protocol MimbleWimble but they had many exchanges out of the gate including bittrex, poloniex, okex. And they didn't even raise any money. I think AR being native token doesn't give sufficient explanation.


[28-Feb-19 04:19 AM] ATLAS#7218
Also, do you consider doing something to protect investors?


[28-Feb-19 04:22 AM] ATLAS#7218
I can mine 1200$ worth of AR with minimal expense but investors were given 0 opportunity for liquidating their token. Basically, investors can't do anything but to see their token losing value.


[28-Feb-19 04:30 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@ATLAS Now Stan Dantes will come and scold us that we are discussing about exchanges.


[28-Feb-19 04:34 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Guys, What is up with the blockchain? It stuck 2 hours ago


[28-Feb-19 04:38 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Hey @slayer_hellraiser, the issue is coming from Viewblock - not the Arweave network :arweave:


[28-Feb-19 04:47 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
If you hear all of Sam's points @ATLAS, he speaks about various criteria for listing from legitimacy and security,  to longevity  - in this regard, we're taking the appropriate steps to ensure the best possible listing conditions for our community.


[28-Feb-19 05:24 AM] ATLAS#7218
I understand NDA and the procedures. Bittrex, Poloniex are not just an exchange. They're reputable. Bittrex has been around for a long time and Okex is leading in China. It took them not long to test it and deploy a brand new protocol. At this point, I am concerned that Arweave has issue in its architecture.


[28-Feb-19 05:24 AM] ATLAS#7218
8 month long testing and preparing to list is too long no matter how you see.


[28-Feb-19 05:26 AM] ATLAS#7218
What do you mean by best possible listing condition? Are you willing to list if  reputable exchange asks your permission to list tomorrow?


[28-Feb-19 05:28 AM] bongtron2811#1436
Listing without marketing will make AR die. And i also dont see any marketing plan for AR


[28-Feb-19 05:29 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Lovely discussion today fellas


[28-Feb-19 05:30 AM] ATLAS#7218

We should not avoid the market. We should overcome it to build a strong big community


[28-Feb-19 05:44 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
If you watch the video @ATLAS, Sam addresses the listing: When would we do it if we had the chance? "Immediately" - If you follow GitHub commits, you will notice some recent updates that make it easier for exchanges to integrate with us. Everything is in progress, we simply cannot say more on the matter. For an in-depth explanation about all of your concerns, I suggest you watch Sam's video 🎥


[28-Feb-19 05:48 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
We are currently focusing on marketing, adoption and community; we've got a bunch of exciting partnerships to be announced over the coming weeks, and the launch of our web deploy tool has now opened up the opportunity for people to grab some tokens and use our tools, therefore we're continually making progress in these areas. 

As I mentioned in my last comment, we're always open to suggestion form our community on what they would like to see more of, however if it's a case of liquidity - we have been clear about our progress in this area.


[28-Feb-19 05:54 AM] ATLAS#7218
I would not say you were clear about your progress for the last 8 months. I know there is NDA but if that progress is taking longer than 8 months, I am not sure if that is a progress at all.


[28-Feb-19 05:55 AM] ATLAS#7218
But thank you for clarifying


[28-Feb-19 05:55 AM] ATLAS#7218
I also don't want to be the person who always raises the same concern. I hope you all understand my POV.


[28-Feb-19 06:03 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Thanks for the feedback about our communication  - I will relay this to the team :arweave: I understand your frustration, however I can assure you that we're continually working to make progress in all areas of the project and we'll continue to bring you updates wherever possible 🙏

Is Everipedia using blockchain currently?


[28-Feb-19 08:33 AM] arweave-ivan#6776
AFAIK Everipedia is using "vanilla" IPFS (ie without blockchain or other incentivisation).


[28-Feb-19 08:34 AM] ATLAS#7218
On their website, they're saying **Live and permanent edits of content on the blockchain beyond the control of a central authority.**


[28-Feb-19 08:35 AM] ATLAS#7218
Are they implying their usage of Arweave? Or EOS?


[28-Feb-19 08:35 AM] ATLAS#7218
It seems they're pretty involved with EOS. Are they switching over to Arweave ?

[28-Feb-19 09:11 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Hey @ATLAS, Everipedia uses EOS for smart contracts/ incentivisation. Arweave is simply storing the content that is published on the platform.

Hello all, I'm one of the admins over @ qTrade, we specialize in blockchains build from scratch - which is how I heard about Arweave. I just watched the video w/ Sam regarding exchange listings, and it looks like an interesting project.


[28-Feb-19 09:09 PM] [qtrade.io] Eric#2860
I'm curious about how nodes are incentivized to maintain archived data, lots to learn here.


[28-Feb-19 09:10 PM] [qtrade.io] Eric#2860
Anyways, just wanted to say hi. I'll be lurking learning more about Arweave, but I'd be happy to discuss qTrade and a possible listing if that is of interest to anyone

[01-Mar-19 04:19 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Hey @[qtrade.io] Eric, welcome to the weave! To answer your question: miners are incentivised through mining rewards, which are taken from the mining pool and the transaction pool. Also just a polite note on our server guidelines - we don't allow self-promotion on these channels. Let me know if you've anymore questions, thanks! :arweave: :blockchain: :files:


[01-Mar-19 08:33 AM] [qtrade.io] Eric#2860
Ah so proving you have a copy of at least some of the data is part of the mining process, gotcha.


[01-Mar-19 08:33 AM] [qtrade.io] Eric#2860
Re self advertising: Thanks for the heads up. I'm happy to change my username on this server, but it appears that permission is disabled


[01-Mar-19 08:34 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
That's right @[qtrade.io] Eric - miners have to hold the recall block which means that they have to store data to get the opportunity to mine - the mining generates AR rewards when a block is successfully mined, rewarding that miner who was storing data.


[01-Mar-19 08:35 AM] arweave-sophie#4476

@ATLAS agree with you that projects need to also pull through a bear market while listed to make it big in the long run. I know its frustrating but honestly not helpful that you're repeating the same complaints all the time. Just creates bad mood in the community. Be assured though that it's been heard and that the team is VERY aware of the concerns and really doing all it can. They're not delaying the listing because they're trying to time the market.


[01-Mar-19 12:47 PM] Lasse Clausen#6198
give it some time and mine some more  


[05-Mar-19 12:48 AM] KeeJef#7523
it was clear from the start that Arweave was not a quick flip, im more than happy that Arweave is not on an exchange, id actually rather wait until Arweave generates a large natural userbase before it goes on exchanges, its clear that they have used their money wisely to develop a working product that adds more features and partnerships frequently  


[05-Mar-19 12:55 AM] ATLAS#7218

Exchange is not about flipping. I keep saying and noone seems to get it


[05-Mar-19 01:02 AM] Mazzz#1871
You know the team is giving away 5 tokens to use


[05-Mar-19 01:21 AM] Marcin#0065
Its somehow true, that some possibility to buy tokens must exist. But noone says it must be an exchange


[05-Mar-19 01:33 AM] ATLAS#7218
Maybe you will introduce a new reliable system of buying/selling which is not an exchange.

@ATLAS I would not give up any OTC with small limits (not 10k USD minimum, like a non-working Base58)


[05-Mar-19 01:35 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093

@Dragos the node eventually fills up whatever space is available on the disk partition where you have the `arweave` folder.

aa ok. got it


[05-Mar-19 04:32 AM] tiamat#9131
I think people don't need blockchains as much as we like to believe. That's a reason why they like partnerships and projects that will deliver(or not) instead of working product like Arweave.


[05-Mar-19 04:33 AM] tiamat#9131
The same for high TPS like Tomochain or Gochain(and even POA) which solved pretty much the scaling issue, but nobody touches them.


[05-Mar-19 04:38 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
I personally believe that one of the biggest challenges blockchain faces is educating people on the benefits and various user cases of blockchain tech. There are a lot of projects around, but their offering is often not clear and to the average non-technically minded individual - it's not digestible at all. Once the gap between the tech and clear user cases can be bridged, only then can it scale.


[05-Mar-19 04:41 AM] ATLAS#7218
@tiamat  I personally think they didnt solve the bottleneck in the nature of blockchain


[05-Mar-19 04:41 AM] ATLAS#7218
They claim a bit higher TPS but its still not enough. I won't call it a solution


[05-Mar-19 04:43 AM] ATLAS#7218
Its in the architecture so they all have the same bottleneck going on. Nano, Zilliqa has showed the possible solutions with different architectures and did pretty fine. ZIL did 2700 TPS on their testnet when they did ICO. Not sure how it changed now. But 2700 is still not enough.


[05-Mar-19 04:44 AM] ATLAS#7218
Hopefully, LN or ETH sharding will bring more than that


[06-Mar-19 11:17 PM] digamma889#3785
@ATLAS what is your current view on the architecture of Zilliqa? Zilliqa is supposed to be linearly scalable: more nodes = more transactions per second to the extend of a very large amount of nodes. Often this is one of the scaling bottlenecks, the larger the amount of nodes the more communication meaning slower consensus. 

For full blown adoption of a smart contract platform 2700 tps will not be sufficient indeed. And even TPS in itself doesn't say much. Factoring in security, the level of decentralisation and how executing smart contracts perform in terms of TPS in relation to simple transactions says a lot more than these often ridiculous TPS claims. 

I agree with @arweave-sophie  that one of the biggest challenge is education of the benefits of blockchains and most importantly creating useful usecases which offer something centralised approaches can inherently not equal (because of the simple fact they are centralised)
For me the most interesting use cases for blockchains lay into the public (permissionless) domain where a community and a product/service in combination with economic incentives can be more trustfull than one central party. Arweave is one of these examples. If a large and varied enough community will support Arweave via several ways (developing, archiving, mining etc.) than it can offer something no other party can provide (permanent data storage).

So yes there has been lots of speculating and 'let's blockchain everything because it's supposed to solve all problems' but from what I see emerge on the technical architecture side of things as well as usefull usecases adoption is slowly happening

[07-Mar-19 01:10 AM] ATLAS#7218
TPS indeed doesn't say much as some projects tend to abuse the spamming of txs from one node etc. to make their TPS appear higher. But I was one of ZILs early backers (less than 30 ppl) and afaik, the TPS check was more of a simulation of a real world where there is txs from across the world.

I'm having trouble figuring out what CPU characteristics are important for mining. Does clockspeed matter more than corecount? Does cache matter? Ect.

Does anyone have any experience?


[16-Mar-19 07:58 AM] tiamat#9131
higher  cpu frequency or more cores will get you pretty much the same effect


[16-Mar-19 07:58 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@Mazzz For now: CPU speed - yes, cores number - yes, ntework - possible, fast HDD (SSD better) - possible

Any chance to compensate the investors who paid into the ico, given the extreme devaluation from mining incentives over a prolonged period?

Miners having more than our max contribution is remarkably obscure. Was this an oversight?

@arweave-stan was the mining reward info released to ICO investors?  Did they know that there was such an aggressive AR distribution schedule for the first year? Just wondering.


[22-Mar-19 06:12 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I wasn’t allowed to participate in the ICO so i wasn’t privy to this info.

@blockchainlauren I suggest you start mining asap because rewards are getting lower and lower every day

unlike on other chains, miners are not only securing the weave, they are also providing content


[23-Mar-19 12:02 AM] rehash#3438
they are more prone to dos attacks, abuse reports, censorship attempts, etc


[23-Mar-19 12:25 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Vilenarios during the token sale, it was clearly stated that 11m is for mining reward, which the reward will be decreasing from time to time, also it will take a very long period for the whole 11m  Ar to be mined.

[26-Mar-19 07:22 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@tiamat It works:
{"network":"arweave.N.1","version":5,"release":21,"height":166117,"current":"Dh0FoDmY9Q-1xbObqJworHoRhCat3R9nN9BGd_3uC0dJASkANixjpWuNI-Bgb7ND","blocks":185959,"peers":45,"queue_length":0,"node_state_latency":157}


[26-Mar-19 07:23 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
But chrome extention isn't working


[26-Mar-19 07:24 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Try going  to chrome://extensions and click the reload icon for the arweave extension


[26-Mar-19 07:24 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
That should reload the extension and it'll try to reconnect again


[26-Mar-19 07:24 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
See if that helps


[26-Mar-19 07:24 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Hmm. I try to reload Chrome and wallet working again


[26-Mar-19 07:24 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Did you try it in the way I described above just now?


[26-Mar-19 07:26 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Oh so is it working now? @slayer_hellraiser


[26-Mar-19 08:21 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093

[31-Mar-19 12:32 PM] pierreatka#5111
Hey guys,
I'm getting started on Arweave.
Anyone can tell me what these transactions are?


[31-Mar-19 12:33 PM] pierreatka#5111
Ah can't post screenshot, But on the explorer, Transaction tab , 
There are these transaction with a different logo and 0AR token leaving an address to nowhere


[31-Mar-19 12:33 PM] pierreatka#5111
if anyone had any info  


[31-Mar-19 12:33 PM] pierreatka#5111
https://viewblock.io/arweave/txs?page=3


[31-Mar-19 12:33 PM] pierreatka#5111
first tx there for example


[31-Mar-19 12:48 PM] pierreatka#5111
Also someone knows the current circulating supply of AR tokens?


[31-Mar-19 01:03 PM] arweave-stan#3973
Hello  @pierreatka, glad to have you here, please feel free to dm me the screenshot, I'll be glad to help you check.


[31-Mar-19 01:05 PM] arweave-stan#3973
The circulating supply is approximately 41-42% of the genesis block tokens, the genesis supply is 55million Ar (so that's approximately 23 mil tokens).


[31-Mar-19 10:52 PM] prk#3209
I was looking forward to sell some AR OTC


[31-Mar-19 10:52 PM] prk#3209
Any potential buyers?


[31-Mar-19 10:52 PM] prk#3209
small amount only


[01-Apr-19 12:19 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@prk please we don't allow OTC advertisement in the channel.


[01-Apr-19 07:57 AM] tiamat#9131
@arweave-stan he is not selling anything, it was just for 1 April...who is so stupid to sell AR?  


[01-Apr-19 08:06 AM] Mazzz#1871
@tiamat eh I'd sell my stack for 0.5~1$


[01-Apr-19 08:07 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@tiamat haha, that's ok  


[01-Apr-19 10:21 AM] Marcin#0065
Any other way to check the individual balance, transaction and so on?


[01-Apr-19 10:26 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
@Marcin http://wallet-1.nodes.arweave.org:1984/wallet/<YOUR_WALLET>/balance. And divide the resulting number by 10^12


[01-Apr-19 10:27 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
For TX: http://wallet-1.nodes.arweave.org:1984/tx/<YOUR_TX_ID>


[01-Apr-19 10:28 AM] Marcin#0065
Thanks


[01-Apr-19 11:05 AM] Kevin |#2500
In which channel can we OTC sell? Or buy?


[01-Apr-19 11:15 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Kevin | there's no channel OTC sell or buy is being done, for the safety of our community, we don't allow OTC trades over the channels. we have an OTC desk where you can enquire about liquidation. Please drop drop us an email at team@arweave.org on how to contact the OTC desk Arweave. Thanks


[02-Apr-19 02:49 PM] Kevin |#2500
Thanks, but last time I inquired I needed a lot or Arweave?


[02-Apr-19 02:56 PM] arweave-stan#3973
Yh, $10,000 is the minimum you can trade.


[03-Apr-19 04:52 AM] Marcin#0065
This is still one of the worst moves by the team. Reaching out for people living in countries which bans internet or censors a lot, for those people who are interested in freedom of information. For those who even risk a lot for the truth. No matter if they are rich or poor.

But then telling publicly: only those who can afford minimum 10.000 usd orders can use our "partner" service and buy AR.

Ridiculous.

Why you keep that partnership?


[03-Apr-19 04:55 AM] Marcin#0065
Imagine that (despite that high salaries for IT in Berlin or silicon valley), that 10.000 usd is more than people earn in a year. ???


[03-Apr-19 04:58 AM] ATLAS#7218
thats a bit exaggeration lol


[03-Apr-19 04:58 AM] ATLAS#7218
i think i can earn that even if i collect cans


[03-Apr-19 04:58 AM] ATLAS#7218
in Silicon Valley, you will get that in 2 weeks


[03-Apr-19 04:58 AM] Marcin#0065
Lol. Try that in Africa, India or China, or south america, where most people live in that planet


[03-Apr-19 05:00 AM] Marcin#0065
Of course you need money to survive too, you know ;)


[03-Apr-19 05:00 AM] ATLAS#7218
In any country I can still trade my shitcoins


[03-Apr-19 05:01 AM] ATLAS#7218
And get my yearly lambo


[03-Apr-19 05:01 AM] ATLAS#7218
No problemo


[03-Apr-19 05:01 AM] Marcin#0065
That has nothing to do with my comment about AR otc


[03-Apr-19 05:03 AM] ATLAS#7218
Was just joking dude


[03-Apr-19 05:03 AM] ATLAS#7218
You were like we dont need exchange all the time.


[03-Apr-19 05:03 AM] ATLAS#7218
I wonder what struck you lol


[03-Apr-19 05:04 AM] Marcin#0065
Either no exchange, which is best arm, or some possibility to access for everyone. Right now it looks like a service for wealthy people only. This is my point I don't like about it


[03-Apr-19 05:05 AM] ATLAS#7218
Yo exchange is the term for that


[03-Apr-19 05:05 AM] ATLAS#7218
And why is it best atm


[03-Apr-19 05:05 AM] ATLAS#7218
I guess you still don't get it.


[03-Apr-19 05:05 AM] Marcin#0065
I don't think you want to understand me


[03-Apr-19 05:06 AM] ATLAS#7218
1) No exchange is better atm.


[03-Apr-19 05:06 AM] ATLAS#7218
2) Or means of trading without exchange


[03-Apr-19 05:06 AM] ATLAS#7218
This is what you implied


[03-Apr-19 05:07 AM] ATLAS#7218
Right?


[03-Apr-19 05:08 AM] Marcin#0065
I won't repeat myself again :) I think I made myself clear enough. If u feel like arguing about details, I'm not your man ;)


[03-Apr-19 05:09 AM] ATLAS#7218
Just showing I understood.


[03-Apr-19 05:26 AM] Mazzz#1871
@Marcin you know that you can get 5 free tokens right ...


[03-Apr-19 05:26 AM] Mazzz#1871
That's more than enough to test it out and archive a few pages


[06-Apr-19 05:18 AM] rehash#3438
@arweave-sam how about reducing block rewards to 7 AR like it used to be? I think the community would love that


[06-Apr-19 05:23 AM] Mazzz#1871
@rehash no offence, but that's just retarded


[06-Apr-19 05:30 AM] rehash#3438
well, I know you like to mine, but rewards are just too generous for the long time health of the project


[06-Apr-19 05:31 AM] tiamat#9131
PoS would be great


[06-Apr-19 05:35 AM] tiamat#9131
PoS or rewards proportional with AR holding would be nicer, it would avoid dumping from miners


[06-Apr-19 05:35 AM] Mazzz#1871
@rehash too late to change them now. A hard fork like that will remove all trust from this project


[06-Apr-19 05:36 AM] Mazzz#1871
Best way is to increase adoption of Arweave, so rewards won't seem so big


[06-Apr-19 05:37 AM] rehash#3438
I understand you, but community is more than the voice of a few miners


[06-Apr-19 06:58 AM] rehash#3438
also nothing would get more attention to this project such as a small IEO


[06-Apr-19 02:58 PM] Marcin#0065
Rewards are gong Down soon


[06-Apr-19 02:58 PM] Marcin#0065
It's just high during first year


[06-Apr-19 02:58 PM] Marcin#0065
Was explained in mining channel ready. There were times, when miner did run machines for months without rewards


[07-Apr-19 05:12 AM] Sedanaa#7524

[09-Apr-19 02:29 AM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
I come from Loki project. Fallen in love with this project as well. I was wondering how I can get my hands on some AR


[09-Apr-19 02:29 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Hey @luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻, how’s it going?


[09-Apr-19 02:31 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Awesome, we love Loki too! We’re not currently on exchange and our token sale was last year, however if you drop me a DM I can direct you to the OTC desk :arweave:


[09-Apr-19 02:32 AM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
I feel like it’s too soon to buy. Need a day or two to figure how much and if the price is right.


[09-Apr-19 02:32 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Otherwise, you can grab some AR for free on our website, this allows you to archive web pages and publish applications on the permaweb: https://www.arweave.org/

So how can you use Weavemail? what kind of keyfile is it expecting ?


[12-Apr-19 01:28 AM] Marcin#0065
You can generate a keyfile using the plugin. The keyfile is simply said your address, but only the person with the keyfile can access it.


[12-Apr-19 01:34 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@KeeJef  You can get started with our weavemail by visiting 👉 https://weavemail.app/ 

Also feel free send us a mail: vLRHFqCw1uHu75xqB4fCDW-QxpkpJxBtFD9g4QYUbfw


[12-Apr-19 02:51 AM] rehash#3438
Is the team + community making Arweave/Permaweb to be known better on social media in the context of Assange events?


[12-Apr-19 04:21 AM] Marcin#0065
Maybe assange should give an interview in which he says, he is going to upload all to the arweave ;)


[12-Apr-19 04:21 AM] Marcin#0065
Would be enough I guess


[12-Apr-19 05:02 AM] awkweird#6550
That would  be the greatest news  


[12-Apr-19 05:10 AM] Marcin#0065
But then the nsa will all hack us. We are presenting all ip's on a silver tablet ;)


[12-Apr-19 07:06 AM] awkweird#6550
Will liquidate on base58 before they approach us

@awkweird Base58 is working? Seriously?


[12-Apr-19 11:09 AM] chriscord#4741
Echoing @Marcin: Arweave why are we still exposing IP addresses like siting ducks?


[12-Apr-19 11:37 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Arweave behind Tor would be nice. But the performance may not be great.


[12-Apr-19 11:38 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Kind of hard to host a web service without exposing your IP.


[12-Apr-19 11:47 AM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Are you guys afraid of something? Why do you want to hide?


[12-Apr-19 02:07 PM] chriscord#4741
dos attacks for one


[12-Apr-19 04:49 PM] luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337
I had this idea of storing wikileaks in arweave :D
But too many gbs


[14-Apr-19 08:45 PM] Callen#8951
Will there be any sort of buy-back / compensation for pre-sale & ico investors considering the length of inability to really access their investment?


[14-Apr-19 09:18 PM] arweave-stan#3973
@Callen I'm sorry, we do not have a buy back model, the Ar tokens are unlocked and anyone can use it on the network. Thanks


[14-Apr-19 09:34 PM] tommy282#4496
@arweave-stan  pls check dm


[14-Apr-19 10:19 PM] KeeJef#7523
Yeah you might want to put some instructions on the Arweave mail site, its a little tricky to work out how to get access to your keyfile


[14-Apr-19 10:21 PM] KeeJef#7523
its Arweave Chrome extension ->  wallet -> click on the wallet you want to export -> export key


[15-Apr-19 01:40 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@tommy282 ok


[15-Apr-19 01:42 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@KeeJef thanks for the suggestion, I'll forward to the team 


[15-Apr-19 02:27 AM] Callen#8951
@arweave-stan  yea, but you understand that you were happy to take investors money. I doubt people invested $5k + just to solely use the network. if capital was the issue why didn't you just seek more vc funding instead of hosting an pre-sale and on ico on top? Its been nearly a year since you guys held your crowdfunding and although i know exchanges are a tricky subject, it seems there has been utter disregard for the interests of investors


[15-Apr-19 02:33 AM] Marcin#0065
@Callen if you can't handle investments, don't do it. Be ready to lose all your money thou put into an ico project.


[15-Apr-19 02:33 AM] Mazzz#1871
@Callen I don't feel like time is an issue. I'd rather wait more for the excecution go be perfect than have it subpar


[15-Apr-19 02:34 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Callen please the team never disregarded the members who contributed in the project, project development has been ongoing and we always release updates, there's an constant communication between the team and the community members, regarding the exchange listing, like we said, we're unable to comment on exchange publicly, we'll release news about exchange via our announcement channel when we can. Thanks


[15-Apr-19 02:36 AM] Callen#8951
@Marcin im happily invested, i still like the project a lot. I'm just confused as to why they held a crowdfunding so early


[15-Apr-19 02:43 AM] Marcin#0065
I cannot say, if the team knew by themselves, that  it will take that time. But 1 year is not much for a product. 
One of the core members did die in the early phase of the project development, that gave a huge kickback for the moral and development speed I guess (but I don't know, it's private to the team members)


[15-Apr-19 02:45 AM] Marcin#0065
Among all those trashy ico back then, we all should be dann happy to follow such interesting one as arweave. Its fun and interesting. Regardless of any speculation about price or exchanges


[15-Apr-19 07:25 AM] funnyman#9599
guys i started a node and it shows that earn some rewards but still nothing came to my address


[15-Apr-19 07:25 AM] funnyman#9599
is there any particular reason ?


[15-Apr-19 07:26 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Hey @funnyman, this might be better answered in the #🌟mining channel ⛏  


[23-Apr-19 09:40 AM] tiamat#9131
what's going on? why so much activity on the chain?


[23-Apr-19 09:46 AM] Mazzz#1871
@tiamat why not  


[23-Apr-19 09:50 AM] Mazzz#1871
But it seems to be a guy with control of multiple accounts sending internet specifications and documents to the weave. Who knows why, maybe send him a weave mail and ask haha


[23-Apr-19 09:52 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep, they are all RFCs


[23-Apr-19 09:52 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We are uploading them for the decentralised public library


[23-Apr-19 09:52 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Internet standards are the kind of documents that we really don't want to forget  


[23-Apr-19 09:57 AM] Mazzz#1871
@arweave-sam have you thought about making an elegant viewer/explorer that shows data uploaded to the weave that is easy to see, not like currently where you have to go into specific transactions? Maybe even organise it like a library, or is that up to the dapp and creators to do?


[23-Apr-19 09:58 AM] arweave-sam#9630
That would be great


[23-Apr-19 09:59 AM] arweave-sam#9630
There are lots of pieces of external infrastructure like this that we would love to sponsor as a community project.


[23-Apr-19 09:59 AM] arweave-sam#9630
As a stand in right now you can use a Google search, prefaced with 'site:arweave.net' to search the weave through our gateway


[23-Apr-19 10:01 AM] arweave-sam#9630
It is actually pretty good. Example: https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aarweave.net+barr+summary&oq=site%3Aarweave.net+barr+summary&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.11807j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8


[23-Apr-19 10:07 AM] Mazzz#1871
I would get started on something like that if only my JavaScript was up to scratch, maybe someday


[23-Apr-19 10:07 AM] Mazzz#1871
Also that's pretty neat, completely forgot Google could do that


[23-Apr-19 10:10 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Haha, we didn't realise that Google was doing this until fairly recently. Fringe benefit of using HTTP for everything :).


[23-Apr-19 10:18 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@Mazzz We would love to help out with that, if you were up for it! We would be happy to provide technical help, bounties (AR + BTC/ETH) and traffic through link on the Arweave homepage etc. An index or 'map' is a critical missing part of the permaweb ecosystem. At the moment it is kind of split into islands: There are small groups of interlinked pages, but there is no index that glues it all together.

The simplest version of such a thing would be a kind of `[y]Arhoo` or `hidden weave wiki` that maintains a manual list of interesting content on the weave. This wouldn't require any JS, but at some point would need to be replaced with an `Aroogle` that provides a more dynamic index.


[23-Apr-19 10:34 AM] Mazzz#1871
@arweave-sam yARhoo, I love that haha.

The more I look into it the more I realise it doesn't take that much to make. It's just a matter of incrementing block height and checking whether a tx occured in that block and reading it's data. Couple it with some pretty css and it could update on it's own


[23-Apr-19 11:00 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep @Mazzz !

Id love to submit more content to the weave, but im hesitant to spend money on something that may already be uploaded


[23-Apr-19 12:42 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Having a directory of sorts would be very useful


[23-Apr-19 12:44 PM] Vilenarios#8742
And id be in heaven if the chrome app had a way of telling me "this is already on the weave" .  Which i guess in theory would just be an api call to this yARhoo / ARoogle.


[24-Apr-19 09:35 AM] Mazzz#1871
So this past day I've been working on something similar... but different.  Has anyone else in the early days of arweave always been curious to what people are uploading? How annoying  and cumbersome is it clicking on every new transaction, hoping it would be a cool website or book, but in the end disappointed with a very boring zapier twitter post? WeaveWatcher allows you to preview new transactions quickly!

You probably need to "enable scripts from unsecure sources" in chrome or whatever browser, for the iframes to be seen and for it to work.

@arweave-sam    The Iframes don't seem to work for some reason, even uploading it to the weave fails for some reason.

I think it is a HTTP vs HTTPS thing? If the resource is loaded over HTTPS originally it won't let you load HTTP sub-resources

Hey @Marcin, yes we still have our prototype of this but we expect the first pure file uploader to be tied into the Arweave web extension.

how to check if address is a valid arweave address?


[01-May-19 07:31 AM] aurora#3501
also at /block/height/189781 what is the wallet list field


[01-May-19 07:33 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
You cannot check whether a wallet address is an Arweave wallet specifically @aurora, however Arweave wallets are 43 characters long and can contain any alphanumeric characters, as wall as dashes and underscores (a-z0–9-_)


[01-May-19 07:39 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
The _wallet list_ field would be better explained by @arweave-lev or @arweave-sam, although  I could help if I know what you are trying to find out/achieve @aurora?


[01-May-19 07:41 AM] aurora#3501
nothing just curious why that field is there the wallets are mostly empty in that field have checked a few blocks


[01-May-19 08:02 AM] aurora#3501
and in /tx/<txhash> how do i convert the owner field to arweave address?


[01-May-19 05:42 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@aurora The address is a hash of the public key


[01-May-19 05:42 PM] arweave-sam#9630
`n` in RSA


[01-May-19 05:42 PM] arweave-sam#9630

whys telegram chat muted? is upvest wallet still safest way to hold these tokens or should i move them somewhere?


[02-May-19 12:50 AM] arweave-stan#3973
@Jonski please we moved to discord, as discord's multi-channel feature allows for different areas for different topics of discussion. This allows for focused conversations without conversations getting split and everyone needing to talk over each other in one big group, which could cause some meaningful conversations to get lost and confused. Anyone can follow conversations they are interested in, and ignore topics they wish to.


[02-May-19 12:53 AM] arweave-stan#3973
Yh, upvest wallet is still ok, but you can enjoy some features which Arweave chrome extension wallet has, but upvest wallet do not have, features such as achieving any page of your choice. Thanks

@benji any channel really. What were you thinking of making?


[03-May-19 09:24 PM] benji#5402
I was thinking of making an article publishing platform


[03-May-19 09:25 PM] benji#5402
so, a WYSIWYG editor


[03-May-19 09:25 PM] benji#5402
and an article view for consuming the articles.. Something very like Steemit or Medium


[03-May-19 09:26 PM] benji#5402
then some sort of main page which would aggregate articles, and list / rank them


[03-May-19 09:30 PM] benji#5402
Just a few spots things that I need to figure out before I can say if my idea is realistic or not...
1 - How to keep an aggregate list of articles for display on a main-page
2 - Articles submitted - is that data immutable once stored on the weave
Those are the two questions I have in my head right now, I'm sure more will come up as figure out the parameters of how the arweave works.


[03-May-19 09:32 PM] benji#5402
No doubt this stuff is in the Docs, haven't found it yet however  


[03-May-19 10:12 PM] Mazzz#1871
Sounds pretty cool :) I have a little experience with this so I can point you the right way
1. You can fetch articles from arweave.net, but it's slow unless you have the transactions cached and it's relies entirely on centralised node. Although highly unlikely that node goes down it's possible. This is the easiest way.
You can also run a node and get the data without a centralised node, but it's a bit more in depth.

2. At the moment the data is 100% immutable.


[04-May-19 03:22 AM] arweave-lev#3466
@benji this is a very interesting idea!

The main page can query the Arweave platform for transactions with a specific tag indicating a blog post. You can sort them by rank. Rank can be assigned according to the number of transactions with another tag that can be used for thumbs up-ing the articles. Every transaction costs some tokens so such ranking would have a real basis.

arweave.net load balances between a group of nodes operated by Arweave. We are working on a series of improvements to make it easy for others to create "entry points" or "gateways" into the network.

@Mazzz Could you clarify which cache are you referring to? What was slow according to your experience?


[04-May-19 03:32 AM] Mazzz#1871
@arweave-lev As in storing the chain data. just saying you need a place to store the chain for quick retrieval


[04-May-19 03:44 AM] benji#5402
Ahaaaa sounds like there might be some difficulties with my idea


[04-May-19 03:45 AM] benji#5402
Actually, I'm wrong, looks like it could be doable for sure.

Wooooo nice. Quick question - with these web apps, are they immutable once deployed or is it possible to update / change them ?


[04-May-19 01:53 PM] arweave-sam#9630
They are immutable once deployed, but you can change your DNS (etc.) to new TXIDs to 'update' them


[04-May-19 01:54 PM] arweave-sam#9630
So for example when we update www.weavemail.app , we just change the records to point to the new ID


[04-May-19 01:55 PM] arweave-sam#9630
This means that anyone with the old TXID can still access it, and it will continue to function, but developers can also issue updates  


[04-May-19 01:55 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We are looking at making the 'magic' `GET /[ID]` endpoint also take wallet addresses, and return the data associated with their last transaction


[04-May-19 01:57 PM] arweave-sam#9630
This will allow you to use a single ID for multiple versions of your app, while users can still easily find the old versions using a block explorer

He sums it up well - but this is from 2018

"I really like it, turning miners into storage nodes by forcing the consensus layer is sexy. Good, neat code. Well designed and well documented.
In all honestly, I’ll still store my data on IPFS and S3, but if their token is cheap enough, this could be a great storage solution."


[06-May-19 09:49 AM] tiamat#9131
don't forget it's not the kind of paid review

Yep, we were pretty happy with that one

@tiamat thanks for the link. Apparently the reviewer was not familiar with Erlang and FP. This is the chief feather in the cap of ARWEAVE.

@arweave-sam how many time do you need for answer on mail for the OTC MARKET?


[07-May-19 03:34 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Hey @! [[$0m€B0dy, we try to answer emails in the team inbox within  24hrs. We didn't receive any OTC requests until a hour ago, therefore you should expect a reply soon. If you're referring to Base58, we do not handle any queries from their side, therefore I cannot provide an ETA on a reply from them. Thanks!


[07-May-19 03:58 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I’ve never heard of Erlang before - but I admit I rarely do development with these tools.


[07-May-19 03:59 PM] Vilenarios#8742
@Deleted User why do you feel that it’s so special for Arweave?  Is Erlang used commonly for these types of applications?


[07-May-19 04:09 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Erlang was designed for massively concurrent programs, originally telephony switches etc.


[07-May-19 04:14 PM] arweave-sam#9630
In fact, I think most phone connections are still highly likely to touch an Erlang system in some way


[07-May-19 04:14 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It works great for us, because each of the different components of the node work well as standalone, concurrent processes


[07-May-19 04:15 PM] arweave-sam#9630
For example, the 'book keeping' process that keeps track of the state of the blockweave is a process, the miners themselves are processes, fork recovery is a process, and so is handling each HTTP request.


[07-May-19 04:16 PM] arweave-sam#9630
All of these co-exist simultaneously inside a single node

@Vilenarios Erlang is a general-purpose, concurrent, functional programming language, and a garbage-collected runtime system.  Joe Armstrong one of the creators of Erlang remarked in an interview with Rackspace in 2013: “If Java is 'write once, run anywhere', then Erlang is 'write once, run forever'.” As Tim Bray, director of Web Technologies at Sun Microsystems, expressed in his keynote at O'Reilly Open Source Convention (OSCON) in July 2008: "If somebody came to me and wanted to pay me a lot of money to build a large scale message handling system that really had to be up all the time, could never afford to go down for years at a time, I would unhesitatingly choose Erlang to build it in." I am unaware of any other Crypto project using Erlang, the maturity of this project to select Erlang and build the system that they have is a hallmark. Functional Programming, with Immutable data structures bears many similarities to a blockchain, it also enforces a much structured manner of thinking which eliminates sloppiness that leads to errors in other language designs.


[07-May-19 05:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
Erlang is a secret weapon here, and wholly appropriate for the Application of ARWEAVE.


[07-May-19 06:14 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Wow guys thx for the responses.  Erlang definitely seems interesting.  Looks like a perfect fit to be the framework to drive the distributed network.  I hope to see it scale and provide the needed throughput to support the expected growth


[07-May-19 06:14 PM] Vilenarios#8742
If its used in phone systems - it must be pretty robust


[07-May-19 06:15 PM] Vilenarios#8742
and offer a lot of resiliency


[07-May-19 06:15 PM] Vilenarios#8742
which from what i learned mining AR... its definitely easy as hell to run and manage


[07-May-19 06:42 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I’ve heard of others that use Erlang (like Aeternity protocol) but none for AR use case.

Hey guys, check out this awesome permaweb-based Quora-like system @ `C8g_NDQlKt1T_QxxmDnXZWDogV3Iu84YbDc6lAs06a0` is building!

https://arweave.net/1ArdpfwxDm_iRosA_oEzGypdVGYVQyxemSPzJRlGeyA

I just posted a question there about how we can make tipping on `Querweave` even better. Would be great to hear any other opinions about how we could do this and show `C8g`s invention some love in the process  

 
https://arweave.net/1ArdpfwxDm_iRosA_oEzGypdVGYVQyxemSPzJRlGeyA
Querweave
Querweave


[09-May-19 06:39 PM] Zeus#2212
Hey Sam, I posted an answer there and I don't think/know if I got charged a fee to post on it. It said message dispatched but never asked if I really wanted to send it and show how much it will cost me to answer. The answer was about this too. Doesn't the network charges a small fee every time someone answers, transfer or send a tip? In that case then the attack will still be "expensive" as you say in your question.


[09-May-19 06:40 PM] Zeus#2212
If that's not the case, that's what would I do. the person that answer is the one that is paying the miners fee and not the service (Querweave) itself.


[09-May-19 06:45 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep @Zeus , I think `C8g` based the TX posting code on Weavemail's version, which doesn't show the fee upfront


[09-May-19 06:46 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Your answer should show up when it is mined into a block (assuming you had enough tokens, etc).


[09-May-19 06:47 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep, it is there now


[09-May-19 06:48 PM] arweave-sam#9630
You do pay a fee per TX, but it very small -- approx $0.00006423584.


[09-May-19 06:49 PM] Zeus#2212
yes for now it's very inexpensive


[09-May-19 06:53 PM] arweave-sam#9630
This would mean that in the basic version the user could generate a sum 'tip' of 2335.6 AR from recycling a single token


[09-May-19 06:55 PM] arweave-sam#9630
If we go the 20/80 you could only generate a sum tip of 3 AR, from one AR, before the token is totally dispersed to the miners


[09-May-19 06:55 PM] arweave-sam#9630
If my calculations are correct

thanks @arweave-sam & @arweave-lev for the brilliant idea  


[10-May-19 12:17 PM] Lyner#9077
the spam attack is interesting. I think there're a lot of solutions, like the one you said


[10-May-19 12:22 PM] Lyner#9077
also, is there a function to set fee used in the js library?  and is the "default fee" is up to the miner?


[10-May-19 12:34 PM] tiamat#9131
nice idea, but why such a weird name? why not just qweave ? too many vowels lead to typos


[10-May-19 12:39 PM] Lyner#9077

[10-May-19 02:48 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Thanks for building such an awesome project!!


[10-May-19 02:48 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I will stop referring to you as `C8g` now  


[10-May-19 02:49 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@arweave-kyle will know best, but I think you can just set the `reward` value in the JSON TX structure before signing it


[10-May-19 02:50 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Is that right @arweave-kyle ?


[10-May-19 02:50 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Thanks also for open sourcing it, @Lyner !


[10-May-19 02:50 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I am really excited about the potential for open source, non-data siloed, forkable projects on the permaweb


[10-May-19 02:51 PM] arweave-sam#9630
They give the user a huge amount of power to customise their experience, above what you can get on the centralised web


[10-May-19 03:31 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @Lyner , yeah you can simply set the `reward` field when you create the transaction object. If you don't set it yourself the library will make a call automatically to the /price endpoint and set the fee to the minimum acceptable based on the data size.

So like this...

```javascript
let transaction = arweave.createTransaction({
    data: '<html><head><meta charset="UTF-8"><title>Hello world!</title></head><body></body></html>'
    reward: '10'
}, jwk);
```

The amounts are always in winston and not AR, but there's helper methods to convert between the two

```javascript
let transaction = arweave.createTransaction({
    data: '<html><head><meta charset="UTF-8"><title>Hello world!</title></head><body></body></html>'
    reward: arweave.ar.arToWinston('0.5') // 0.5AR = 500000000000 winston
}, jwk);
```

What are the most important factors for a miner's hardware - is it latency and storage based for the most part ?


[11-May-19 09:41 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Currently because not much data on the weave it’s primarily cpu then latency


[11-May-19 09:42 AM] benji#5402
primarily CPU, so are miners still doing POW to compete for a block ?


[11-May-19 09:42 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep @benji


[11-May-19 09:43 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The basic optimisation route is:
Storage > CPU > Network connection


[11-May-19 09:43 AM] arweave-sam#9630
As @Vilenarios points out, there isn't too much on the weave yet, so the storage component is easy to 'max out'


[11-May-19 09:44 AM] benji#5402
right.


[11-May-19 09:44 AM] benji#5402
so is it the case where the fastest CPU will mine the most blocks at the moment, as in hash power uber alles


[11-May-19 09:45 AM] arweave-sam#9630
As long as you have a few hundred GB of storage, and are not connected via dial up, yes


[11-May-19 09:46 AM] benji#5402
oook, I set up a miner on a VPN machine, I think it's like 25gb storage.


[11-May-19 09:47 AM] benji#5402
I assume that's going to hurt my chances of mining blocks ?  


[11-May-19 09:49 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Afraid so!


[11-May-19 09:49 AM] benji#5402
55GB MB


[11-May-19 09:49 AM] benji#5402
my bad D;


[11-May-19 09:49 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You will only be able to hash on 25% of the blocks at that point


[12-May-19 02:10 PM] benji#5402
I notice the bounty value has gone up on gitcoin - does this apply to currently accepted proposals ?


[12-May-19 05:10 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We calculate the USD value while dispatching the tip


[12-May-19 05:10 PM] arweave-sam#9630
So I am afraid that you don't win from the ETH value increase  


[12-May-19 05:11 PM] benji#5402
Actually, what I was referring to is


[12-May-19 05:11 PM] benji#5402
bounty value was 216 a few days ago... seems to be ~460 now


[12-May-19 05:12 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Oh


[12-May-19 05:12 PM] arweave-sam#9630
That is just us topping up so that we can give out multiple rewards


[12-May-19 05:12 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It displays the whole pool, not each reward


[12-May-19 05:12 PM] benji#5402
ooo ok  


[12-May-19 05:13 PM] arweave-sam#9630
 


[12-May-19 05:14 PM] benji#5402
possible to complete the same bounty more then once ?


[12-May-19 05:14 PM] benji#5402
as in, if I have other ideas, is it worth applying them for the bounty ?


[12-May-19 05:15 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Sure!


[12-May-19 05:15 PM] arweave-sam#9630
The bounty is really just a kind of permanent hackathon  


[12-May-19 05:15 PM] benji#5402
That's awesome


[12-May-19 05:16 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We will be changing the rules a bit in the near future though, just making it available for projects where the code is open source


[12-May-19 05:16 PM] arweave-sam#9630
(Won't apply 'backwards', obviously, but might be relevant for your next thing   )


[12-May-19 05:17 PM] benji#5402
No worries - I actually thought this needed to be open source


[12-May-19 05:17 PM] benji#5402
I've been pushing all the code to my github  


[12-May-19 05:17 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Haha


[12-May-19 05:17 PM] arweave-sam#9630
The more open source the better  


[12-May-19 05:17 PM] benji#5402
I'm happy to share anyways, if my code can help someone build something useful, happy days


[12-May-19 05:18 PM] arweave-sam#9630
> (we ask that you keep the code open source — whatever OSS license you prefer).
Oh -- I did already specify this it seems


[12-May-19 05:18 PM] arweave-sam#9630
> if my code can help someone build something useful, happy days

Yeah, in the early days building up this library of open apps people can 'remix' will be very helpful


[12-May-19 05:19 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We are actually pretty excited about the possibility of open source web services running on the Arweave. Because the user pays for what they use (even though it is an infinitesimal amount to them), there is no cost for usage to the developer.


[12-May-19 05:21 PM] arweave-sam#9630
This seems to have been the primary blocker in building open source web services previously -- once they become successful, they become expensive to run. That means that the developers have to either:
1. Run the service 'out of pocket'.
2. Rapidly monetise the service, lowering user experience.
3. Gain VC funding -- which leads to heavy monetary extraction from the user base further down the line.


[12-May-19 05:22 PM] arweave-sam#9630
With permaweb apps, the developer avoids that problem completely, because the user is paying


[12-May-19 05:23 PM] benji#5402
right, the user pays to write to the database. it's very cool. I've been ranting to people about how awesome this platform is


[12-May-19 05:24 PM] benji#5402
hard to get non tech people to understand and get excited though


[12-May-19 05:27 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Haha, yeah. It is early days, though. Once we have the foundations of the ecosystem in place, we should slowly start to be able to _show_ people the benefits, rather than having to explain it


[12-May-19 05:28 PM] arweave-sam#9630
This is already starting to happen


[12-May-19 05:28 PM] arweave-sam#9630
When we started this ~2 years ago, we had to try and paint a 'vision' of what the ecosystem might look like


[12-May-19 05:29 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Nowadays we just show people weavemail.app , CRIAG ( http://onthe.arweave.org/8D5gWXXT_LDQceiUgIWg8b8kJ3XVIFOLh4n7Za8lbME ), Chronolock ( https://arweave.net/xqx3Ua8VBQLgdKqlI4gtZdVoXxLLF8csKn5in-joJqo )


[12-May-19 05:30 PM] arweave-sam#9630
And now @Lyner 's Quorweave  


[12-May-19 05:31 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Makes it much easier to get people interested when you can show them working apps


[12-May-19 05:31 PM] benji#5402
Yup


[12-May-19 05:33 PM] benji#5402
Kudos for getting it off the ground. Lots of projects which raised in 2017 still spinning their wheels.


[12-May-19 05:34 PM] benji#5402
Those are great apps - I'm particularly impressed with quorweave


[12-May-19 05:34 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep, it is really awesome  


[12-May-19 05:35 PM] benji#5402
serverless app with micropayments 🙃


[12-May-19 05:35 PM] benji#5402
totally amazing


[12-May-19 05:35 PM] benji#5402
is development ongoing for those ?


[12-May-19 05:36 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Mostly, yes


[12-May-19 05:36 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@arweave-lev and I actually set up a kind of experimental DAO system for governing weavemail.app development


[12-May-19 05:36 PM] arweave-sam#9630
So that it sits in totally decentralised ownership


[12-May-19 05:37 PM] benji#5402
sounds cool, does that live on arweave as well ?


[12-May-19 05:37 PM] arweave-sam#9630
No, Aragon for now  


[12-May-19 05:37 PM] benji#5402
that's groovy man


[12-May-19 05:37 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Arweave purely does data storage and querying


[12-May-19 05:37 PM] arweave-sam#9630
But you can integrate Ethereum/other smart contract chains really easily


[12-May-19 05:38 PM] arweave-sam#9630
As they all have frameworks for talking with the network through the browser


[12-May-19 05:39 PM] benji#5402
so Quorweave development is ongoing ? It seems like for an app to be competitive on the web they need alot of polish


[12-May-19 05:40 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep, that is fair


[12-May-19 05:40 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Lyner is the lead dev for it


[12-May-19 05:40 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Although I had a few things I wanted to contribute when I get a moment


[12-May-19 05:40 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I think Lyner is accepting open source contributions  


[12-May-19 05:41 PM] benji#5402
I sent him a tip ;D


[12-May-19 05:41 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Haha, awesome!


[12-May-19 05:42 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It is cool that with these apps, there is always a way to tip the author -- even if the author is anonymous


[12-May-19 05:42 PM] benji#5402
Yup. that's awesome


[12-May-19 05:43 PM] benji#5402
is it cool if I put a 'tip the author' button in the thing I'm making atm ?


[12-May-19 05:43 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Of course!!


[12-May-19 05:43 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It is your app  


[12-May-19 05:44 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It might be cool if we make a generic type of 'tip this author' button library at some point


[12-May-19 05:44 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Like how you can easily embed a 'Donate with PayPal' button on the centralised web


[12-May-19 05:46 PM] benji#5402
That would be very cool


[12-May-19 05:47 PM] arweave-sam#9630
One for the list  


[12-May-19 05:48 PM] benji#5402

[13-May-19 06:19 AM] benji#5402
Quick question regarding tags : Is it possible to do a arQl query on just tag-keys ?


[13-May-19 06:19 AM] benji#5402
for example, can I get a list of all the transactions that have a 'App-name' field ?


[13-May-19 06:34 AM] arweave-lev#3466
Hey @benji , no, I am afraid, it's not possible at the moment   As a workaround I would suggest to come up with an additional key-value tag pair that every app that wants to be indexed in your service would need to include.


[13-May-19 06:34 AM] benji#5402
so it's actually for content tagging / categorisation


[13-May-19 06:35 AM] benji#5402
I want to get a list of all the content tags which would be used by my app

[13-May-19 10:27 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I am pretty interested in the idea of having pieces of information that are 'timelock decrypted' on the weave


[13-May-19 12:22 PM] Vilenarios#8742
smart contracts on the weave


[13-May-19 12:41 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
With 1-60 minutes block time...


[13-May-19 12:41 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Too slow, slowest like BTC


[13-May-19 02:07 PM] tiamat#9131
Arweave avg is 2 minutes while BTC is 10 minutes


[13-May-19 02:09 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
BTC 10 min, AR 1-60 min. Very unstable blocktime


[13-May-19 02:10 PM] tiamat#9131
this is because of PoW not because of Arweave particularly


[13-May-19 02:11 PM] tiamat#9131
PoS is superior in this matter


[13-May-19 02:18 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Our block re-target time also too short, making it very fast to react to changes in hashing power, but also leading to slightly unstable block times.


[13-May-19 02:18 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We might increase the retarget time slightly in the upcoming RandomX release.


[13-May-19 02:19 PM] tiamat#9131
if  you look at Ethereum https://www.etherchain.org/blocks you may see 1 sec block times and 88 sec block times


[13-May-19 02:20 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@Vilenarios The problem with smart contracts for time release encryption is how you avoid putting the key itself in the smart contract source code?


[13-May-19 02:22 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I have spoken to a couple of people about this recently, haven't yet heard a better solution than requiring 'work' to brute force a random password, or encrypting for the public key of a pair whose private key will be released by a trusted party on a given day.


[13-May-19 02:22 PM] arweave-sam#9630
A slightly better version of the second option is to use some kind of split key, but it still isn't great


[13-May-19 02:22 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Ideas welcome  


[13-May-19 02:23 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@tiamat Yep, PoW is always a bit like this, but I know we can at least make ours slightly better.


[13-May-19 02:26 PM] tiamat#9131
generally PoW is a weakness for coins that are not top5 or so


[13-May-19 02:27 PM] tiamat#9131
Zilliqa managed to get an interesting approach with their PoW window


[13-May-19 02:29 PM] tiamat#9131
Just think that any mining pool/farm (asic for bitcoin, cpu for monero, gpu for eth) could easily attack smaller coins if they redirect hashing for a few minutes.


[13-May-19 02:32 PM] arweave-sam#9630
PoS is a no-go for us, because it generates 'nothing at stake' (ironically) problems when you put it underneath proof of access. Mining needs to cost something, otherwise if you don't have the recall block, there is no reason not to continue mining on the previous block.


[13-May-19 02:32 PM] arweave-sam#9630
RandomX will at least get us pretty close to `one CPU, one vote`, as Satoshi put it.


[13-May-19 02:35 PM] tiamat#9131
I don't understand. You need storage + stake, where is the problem?


[13-May-19 02:36 PM] tiamat#9131
Satoshi designed a currency that has the most hashing power. But smaller coins have limited hashing posibilities.


[13-May-19 02:36 PM] tiamat#9131
It is simple, someone rents 1000 CPUs from a cloud provider and attacks a small coin.


[13-May-19 02:37 PM] arweave-sam#9630
You can simply ignore the new block if you don't have the recall block and pretend it didn't happen. If you don't have value expenditure in your mining, there is no incentive not to do this.


[13-May-19 02:39 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We also prefer that work sets up a kind of three-check power structure: miners (vote with hardware), token holders (show assent/dissent by buying/selling the token), and users (show assent with usage). Somewhat similar to the spread of power in the US constitution.


[13-May-19 02:39 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Neither systems are perfect, however.


[13-May-19 02:39 PM] tiamat#9131
Something hybrid maybe? without staking chain is not secure.


[13-May-19 02:39 PM] tiamat#9131
Of course many projects are in the same situation  


[13-May-19 02:40 PM] tiamat#9131
But I remember in 2018 someone created a site where they were gathering hashing power and use it to prove how insecure small chains are.


[13-May-19 02:40 PM] tiamat#9131
Not sure if they started to attack someone yet, I didn't follow.


[13-May-19 02:41 PM] tiamat#9131
with 6 cents /hour for a 8 CPU server costs of attacks are minimal


[13-May-19 02:41 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We could maybe look at something hybrid after the initial RandomX fork


[13-May-19 02:41 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We liked the idea of hybrid RandomX+Proof of Capacity for a while


[13-May-19 02:42 PM] arweave-sam#9630
This would cause miners to have to prove that they have excess CPU power and hard drive space


[13-May-19 02:42 PM] tiamat#9131
80 000  CPUS are only 600$ for 1 hour   


[13-May-19 02:42 PM] tiamat#9131
Proof of Capacity could help


[13-May-19 02:42 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Both great things to have as an Arweave miner


[13-May-19 02:42 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Only somewhat


[13-May-19 02:42 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Maybe some kind of PoA + (PoC+RandomX+PoS)


[13-May-19 02:43 PM] tiamat#9131
but staking is the way to make an attack not profitable


[13-May-19 02:43 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep, it just needs to be in conjunction with a value expending mining method to avoid the 'nothing at stake' issue.


[13-May-19 02:44 PM] tiamat#9131
why would a miner ignore the block? if the majority accepts it

> However, this algorithm has one important flaw: there is "nothing at stake". In the event of a fork, whether the fork is accidental or a malicious attempt to rewrite history and reverse a transaction, the optimal strategy for any miner is to mine on every chain, so that the miner gets their reward no matter which fork wins.


[13-May-19 02:47 PM] arweave-sam#9630
This page puts it pretty well


[13-May-19 02:47 PM] arweave-sam#9630
But we have it slightly worse


[13-May-19 02:48 PM] arweave-sam#9630
As it could remove the incentives from the PoA game, too


[13-May-19 02:49 PM] arweave-sam#9630
You are right though that some form of stake is the way around the other problem


[13-May-19 02:49 PM] arweave-sam#9630
And hybrid is probably the best way to get around both issues.


[13-May-19 02:50 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Also, PoS requires that miners have their key locally, which isn't great


[13-May-19 02:51 PM] arweave-sam#9630
As they need to sign new blocks


[13-May-19 02:51 PM] arweave-sam#9630
And their IPs are all public, so it makes them big targets


[13-May-19 02:54 PM] tiamat#9131
yeah, but security of a single miner is his business after all, if the miner wants to get rewards he better secure his stuff, while the PoW is a vulnerability for the whole chain


[13-May-19 02:55 PM] arweave-sam#9630
If there was some kind of vulnerability in the mining client that exposed the key remotely, an attacker could steal _every key_ , which would very quickly become an issue for the whole network.


[13-May-19 02:56 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Particularly as the keys would allow the miner to control block production


[13-May-19 02:56 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Steal half the keys from half of the miners, then send some of the stolen funds to the miners that _didn't_ have their keys stolen, and you would cause absolute mayhem.


[13-May-19 02:57 PM] tiamat#9131
I remember Ethereum had a solution for this when they were talking their PoS implementation


[13-May-19 02:57 PM] tiamat#9131
but I think it involved SC


[13-May-19 02:57 PM] arweave-sam#9630
This is particularly a problem for chains (like ours) that only have one client


[13-May-19 03:03 PM] tiamat#9131
Proof of Capacity could help, on cloud providers storage seems to be more expensive


[13-May-19 03:03 PM] tiamat#9131
also helps with botnets


[13-May-19 03:04 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Indeed


[13-May-19 03:04 PM] tiamat#9131
a large percent of Monero is mined by malware bots


[13-May-19 03:05 PM] tiamat#9131
or memory-intensive algo, but then people would complain they can't run the miner on a cheap  vps or some old machine  


[13-May-19 03:07 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep, I think PoA + (RandomX + PoS [+ PoC]) will be the eventual solution, in one form or another


[13-May-19 03:07 PM] arweave-sam#9630
But we will do it in phases


[13-May-19 03:11 PM] tiamat#9131
1) PoA 2) Proof of Relay 3) PoC  (I have stored data, I serve data, I am willing to store more data) CPU is just waste of energy


[13-May-19 03:22 PM] rehash#3438
@arweave-sam >> one CPU, one vote, as Satoshi put it.     in 2008 you could not start 1000 AWS instances with a single click

[14-May-19 02:02 AM] rehash#3438
@arweave-sam you already have sort of "nothing at stake". Imagine that a certain block is mined only by 51% miners due to content policy. Then in the future whenever that block is recalled, some miners will not have it and they will just have to wait for the next one OR they try to remine current block. And have a high chance because majority math could have changed since then. Or to put it  simply, if only 10% of the miners have the recall block, for the rest of 90% it makes sense to remine current block instead of waiting. Not sure if this could turn into an ugly fork race, but for sure PoAcc + PoW are going to perform very poorly  for block time consistency once the network grows and not all miners have the recall block.


[14-May-19 03:25 AM] tiamat#9131
@Zeus Yes, PoC is very cool, some people here actually prepared in advanced last year for something like this with hdds/ssds and are very disappointed by the CPU mining. A community vote held on the weave for  PoW vs PoC would be very nice  


[14-May-19 04:56 AM] Lyner#9077

[14-May-19 07:55 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We really need an index for all of the other stuff on the weave


[14-May-19 07:56 AM] Zeus#2212
hehe thanks and you will be very surprised about my next one, this one is to get to know better the platform and the API, but next one is a bigger one that will take longer to build ^_^


[14-May-19 07:57 AM] Zeus#2212
was thinking of the name, what about ArApps?


[14-May-19 07:57 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We have jokingly called the manual index `Yarhoo` before


[14-May-19 07:58 AM] Zeus#2212
haha like that one  


[14-May-19 07:58 AM] arweave-sam#9630
But I am not sure Yahoo would like that, if it became very popular  


[14-May-19 07:58 AM] Zeus#2212
yeah lol


[14-May-19 07:59 AM] Zeus#2212
I built a desktop app some time ago to listen to music for free without any ads and limitations, I called it YouFree and you bet youtube wasn't happy about it


[14-May-19 07:59 AM] Zeus#2212
had to change the name, put things about we are not part of youtube, bla bla


[14-May-19 07:59 AM] Mazzz#1871
I dont think youtube is unhappy with it because of its name haha


[14-May-19 07:59 AM] Zeus#2212
wasn't funny when I got the first message from them, got so scared haha so now I tend to go far from company names that already exists haha 🤣


[14-May-19 08:00 AM] Zeus#2212
well yeah, was using yt-dl on the backend to just listent to the songs, breaking their ads, etc, so probably not just the name 🤣


[14-May-19 08:01 AM] Zeus#2212
guess that's what they found to get me, because there wasn't a server online for it, everyone was listening to the song directly so every IP they got was unique, just like when you go directly to their site, they still knew what I was doing for sure

anyway see you guys later, gonna start looking into the idea for Arweave

^ Is this the first spam on the weave?  


[14-May-19 08:48 AM] Zeus#2212
@arweave-sam yeah I saw it before but there's two things I find I don't like with this one:
1. It's showing every content in an iframe, which takes a lot of unnecessary bandwidth for a user and it's a bad practice to have that many iframes directly there, when I visited before there was even one with an alert, so it can get exploited to hurt the site. 
2. We get all sorts of strange things like this: http://prntscr.com/nofo8m 

It's still a neat idea that place and I liked it when I saw it, but my idea is more of a user managed one, the user need to publish his content, it will be a directory with links to the places instead of iframes and I would like to have a "vote" system in place where people can vote for the top apps.


[14-May-19 08:49 AM] Zeus#2212
With this vote idea I have the same issue as @Lyner was talking before, where someone could vote for himself so many times haha


[14-May-19 08:52 AM] Zeus#2212
my design will be built based on Material Design ^_^


[14-May-19 08:53 AM] Lyner#9077
content moderation is a challenge :P


[14-May-19 08:54 AM] Mazzz#1871
@Zeus Thanks for the feedback! I've thought about displaying the frames as screenshots of web pages, but I don't think such code would allow it to be stored fully on the weave. For 2. Maybe a community filter that filters junk? That would have to be voted by the community, but now it's starting to look like a library, it's all complex man haha


[14-May-19 08:55 AM] Zeus#2212
haha yeah @Mazzz I know, I though of that too and wanted to share the idea here and noticed there wouldn't be a way to have it with screenshots entirely as a weaveapp without any external interaction  


[14-May-19 08:58 AM] Zeus#2212
in fact no moderation @Lyner so let's hope not too much   or on it hahaha but will have a voting system. In newer versions I could add a moderation to manually "ban" the accounts that are sharing bad content. Let's see how much I can achieve in the expected time first   learning more about Arweave as I go so thanks everyone that chat everyday here, been learning a lot from you


[14-May-19 08:58 AM] Zeus#2212
@Lyner btw, did you found a way to prevent that vote spamming you talked about before?


[14-May-19 09:01 AM] Zeus#2212
the thing about manual moderation is that this removes a very important thing about the Arweave, I could chose what I want on it and what not, doesn't sound "fair"  


[14-May-19 09:02 AM] Lyner#9077
nothing implemented yet, but sam's solution seems effective enough for now: splitting the AR contribution like 80% to the content maker and 20% to another wallet (site creator / perhaps a universal donation fund wallet?)


[14-May-19 09:03 AM] Lyner#9077
> the thing about manual moderation is that this removes a very important thing about the Arweave, I could chose what I want on it and what not, doesn't sound "fair"


[14-May-19 09:04 AM] Lyner#9077
yeah, the solution I think is to separate public platform and more private platforms


[14-May-19 09:04 AM] Lyner#9077
same arweave metadata, but handling it differently according to the front web platform


[14-May-19 09:06 AM] Lyner#9077
or we do something like stackoverflow's, the more donations you received/give, the more features users can have (including moderation privilege)


[14-May-19 09:06 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yeah, we are actually expecting the system to evolve such that gateways (which run the ArQL indexes) will become akin to 'moderation communities'


[14-May-19 09:07 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The idea is that a community of likeminded people would form around a set of content policies that a gateway uses


[14-May-19 09:07 AM] Mazzz#1871
Isn't Loki silo working on the private side of things?


[14-May-19 09:07 AM] arweave-sam#9630
If a piece of content matches the content policy, it won't be indexed, so won't show up in ArQL queries

{Reactions}
😍 

[14-May-19 09:08 AM] arweave-sam#9630
This essentially allows you to have different 'lenses' on the content in the weave, without changing a single line in the apps themselves

{Reactions}
  (2) 

[14-May-19 09:09 AM] arweave-sam#9630
In fact, people across different gateways can still use and communicate with the same apps, but someone using a conservative gateway might not see messages that contain offensive words, for example


[14-May-19 09:09 AM] arweave-sam#9630
But those using permissive gateways would


[14-May-19 09:09 AM] arweave-sam#9630
This essentially removes the need for the app developer to decide on issues relating to censorship -- the users themselves decide what they want to see.


[14-May-19 09:11 AM] arweave-sam#9630
At scale, we think this could be pretty cool -- there always comes a point in the lifecycle of every social application where the developer (who just wants to build an awesome app) has to start deciding what people can and cannot say. If they censor too little, people are angry, if they censor too much, people are angry. It is a no-win situation for the dev.


[14-May-19 09:12 AM] arweave-sam#9630
With this mechanism, the users and the gateway operators decide and the app developer just focuses on building a great user experience.


[14-May-19 09:12 AM] arweave-sam#9630
And yep @Mazzz , SILO does totally private apps  


[14-May-19 09:13 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We haven't really spoken publicly about this system before, so I am super interested to hear any feedback about it  


[14-May-19 09:15 AM] Zeus#2212
well for me this sounds like an amazing idea, as you say, if we sensor too little people are angry, and too much is the same result haha I love that users + operators will be able to decide together.


[14-May-19 09:16 AM] Zeus#2212

I would say app developers should keep the gateways model in mind in a sense that apps should gracefully handle the possibly missing content.

I wonder if we could make a generalised interface for getting the latest name as part of the Arweave.js library, so that it is really easy to integrate into other apps


[14-May-19 03:12 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@Lyner : Weavemail with ArweaveID support baked in:

[14-May-19 03:15 PM] arweave-sam#9630
When you login with an address with an ArweaveID `name` attached, you should see your name at the top. Similarly, when you get a message from another user with an address, you should see it in the 'from' column  


[14-May-19 03:15 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It was super easy to integrate


[14-May-19 03:15 PM] arweave-sam#9630

[14-May-19 03:30 PM] Vilenarios#8742
So i have to drag and drop my json file w/ private keys - im assuming its all safely encrypted and what not, right?


[14-May-19 03:40 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
@Lyner @arweave-sam looking at fork-awesome, it looks like if you try building it locally the paths should make sense so deploy should be able to resolve the font files. It should base64 encode the fonts and inline them in the CSS, so I think that should work


[14-May-19 03:40 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
I think we’ll add the ability to specify per-resource inlining behaviour on deploy


[14-May-19 03:49 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@Vilenarios The current security model is 'make a new key, give it only as many tokens as you trust the app with'


[14-May-19 03:50 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We are working on a kind of `ArPal` service that runs in a gateway and allows you to put your trust instead the web extension or gateway provider


[14-May-19 03:57 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
Yeah so in principle it will work sort of like a decentralised PayPal, but your keys will be stored encrypted in a separate sandboxed LocalStorage away from the application, and they’ll never leave your machine.


[14-May-19 03:58 PM] Vilenarios#8742
i love the Ar* naming convention


[14-May-19 03:58 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
And we’re building the API so that any other services can be swapped out, so the web extension on desktop will also be able to sign transactions


[14-May-19 03:59 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Interesting... so applications could involve arweave on your behalf securely


[14-May-19 04:00 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
Yup! And with the browser based localstorage backed option it’s natively mobile friendly too, no extension required


[14-May-19 04:10 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@Vilenarios the ar* naming convention seems to be losing out to weave* at the moment

One ~15 line function (the same one I used for weavemail)

Easy integration will be really important for getting it adopted by the other apps

@benji maybe ArweaveID might be useful for your blogging platform, too?


[14-May-19 05:50 PM] Zeus#2212
Hey @arweave-sam Thanks, I'm gonna implement it on the permaweb I'm building for the bounty!   and thanks @Lyner for creating this   💯


[14-May-19 06:39 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Looks like you just created the first application-layer permaweb standard, @Lyner . Congrats ;).

That is awesome, @Zeus


[14-May-19 06:40 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Is this for the indexer or the `secret project`?  


[14-May-19 06:40 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We need an index more than ever, I am beginning to lose track of everything on the weave

I'm looking at the commit, can't figure out what the shape of the data that comes from `get_name_query` returns


[14-May-19 06:53 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I think it is a query result of some kind, But @arweave-kyle would know best


[14-May-19 06:54 PM] benji#5402
More generally, I'm using typescript, so I'd love to see types and interfaces for the arweave package


[14-May-19 06:54 PM] benji#5402
So nice for describing the API


[14-May-19 06:55 PM] benji#5402
Problem is, finding typescript a bit slow with react - there's JS styles in react for some UI packages which hobble the IDE


[14-May-19 06:55 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I will definitely leave that to Kyle

Hey guys, I've been trying for about an hour now to get my wallet ID with arweaveID and I'm getting this error: 
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400 ()    arweave.net/tx:1
```
I though it was maybe something down so I was waiting on this and was working on the index, I was also waiting for my app to finish publishing the link I sent, also an hour ago and didn't notice I got the same error before. Since I didn't get anything yet did another test and saw it. Having the same error on my app than on ArweaveID :/


[14-May-19 10:13 PM] Zeus#2212
just tested it on Querweave, same issue ```VM121:1 POST https://arweave.net/tx 400```


[14-May-19 10:14 PM] arweave-sam#9630
What kind of TX did you send to Querweave @Zeus ?


[14-May-19 10:14 PM] arweave-sam#9630
And which version did you use?


[14-May-19 10:14 PM] Zeus#2212
I did an answer with the text: "testing"


[14-May-19 10:14 PM] Zeus#2212

[14-May-19 10:15 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Hmmm


[14-May-19 10:15 PM] Zeus#2212
I can login, and even if I get the error, I get answer dispatched. same on my app, even with the error, I get permaweb link sent


[14-May-19 10:15 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I just submitted an answer and got a `200`


[14-May-19 10:16 PM] Zeus#2212
gonna try on another browser not sure why it's happening now I haven't installed any new extensions or anything like that recently


[14-May-19 10:16 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Are you submitting transactions very frequently from the same wallet?


[14-May-19 10:17 PM] arweave-sam#9630
The network expects the application to keep track of the `last_tx` value when submitting multiples transactions before they have settled


[14-May-19 10:17 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Maybe your transactions are being rejected because they are clobbering one another?


[14-May-19 10:18 PM] Zeus#2212
I did try to send two transactions at the same time this morning while testing arweave.js but since then I just did 2 transactions, one for my username which never worked and one for the index app I'm building


[14-May-19 10:18 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Hmmm, ok


[14-May-19 10:18 PM] Zeus#2212
ok so same issue on a browser without any extensions :/


[14-May-19 10:18 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Interesting


[14-May-19 10:19 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Do you have access to two wallets?


[14-May-19 10:19 PM] Zeus#2212
do you know how long I will be rejected from the network? :/


[14-May-19 10:19 PM] Zeus#2212
I have two but one has 0 balance only this one has a balance hehe


[14-May-19 10:19 PM] arweave-sam#9630
The most often cause of this kind of issue seems to be malformed tags. Have you cheanged those, perhaps?


[14-May-19 10:20 PM] Zeus#2212
on my app I have these ones: 
```js
        tx.addTag('App-Name', App.appName);
        tx.addTag('App-Version', App.appVersion);
        tx.addTag('Unix-Time', Math.round((new Date()).getTime() / 1000));
        tx.addTag('Type', 'publish');
        tx.addTag('Category', category);```


[14-May-19 10:21 PM] Zeus#2212
but didn't touched anything on the querweave or the arweaveID apps


[14-May-19 10:22 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Did you change any of those before the issue started to occur?


[14-May-19 10:23 PM] Zeus#2212
I don't think so, if I remember correctly the first transaction I tried to send was from ArweaveID today, and just after that I started working on the index doing a quick test to see if I got any errors which I did, I was missing my wallet on `createTransaction` solved that and it was sent with these tags in place


[14-May-19 10:24 PM] Zeus#2212
or that's what I though, I noticed now that nothing of this was sent


[14-May-19 10:24 PM] Zeus#2212
and I've been getting that error 400 since then


[14-May-19 10:25 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I see


[14-May-19 10:27 PM] arweave-sam#9630

I get `Request type not found .`


[14-May-19 10:29 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Also, please can you shoot me another address so that we can check if the issue is wallet related?

> Request type not found .
o.O


[14-May-19 10:30 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Interesting...


[14-May-19 10:30 PM] arweave-sam#9630
That is what you get when the server has no corresponding path for the address that you tried to hit.


[14-May-19 10:31 PM] Zeus#2212
oh, maybe cuz I just clicked it?


[14-May-19 10:31 PM] Zeus#2212
ah lol yeah, I was viewing the page, it's a post request, so not related


[14-May-19 10:31 PM] arweave-sam#9630
For example, if I try to go to `https://arweave.net/tx/not_an_endpoint`, I get that specific 400 response.


[14-May-19 10:31 PM] Zeus#2212
I just tried with my 0 balance address and I get the same thing


[14-May-19 10:32 PM] Zeus#2212
for me ```https://arweave.net/tx/not_an_endpoint = Not Found.``` If I go directly from the browser


[14-May-19 10:32 PM] Zeus#2212
gonna send you my json wallet, it has 0 balance anyway, see if you get the same error, is that ok?


[14-May-19 10:36 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Won't be too much help -- we need to see how your apps/code react  


[14-May-19 10:36 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Just the address would work


[14-May-19 10:37 PM] Zeus#2212
omgaaa so sorry... was using the wallet that have 0 balance -.-


[14-May-19 10:37 PM] Zeus#2212
that was the cause


[14-May-19 10:38 PM] arweave-sam#9630
 


[14-May-19 10:38 PM] Zeus#2212
I had 3 wallets not 2, was trying two of them but both were at 0 balance, the good one I moved it to do an easier publish and forgot about that 😖


[14-May-19 10:38 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Ok


[14-May-19 10:38 PM] arweave-sam#9630
So the wallet with a balance does not trigger a 400 response?


[14-May-19 10:38 PM] Zeus#2212
exactly, this one worked 🤣


[14-May-19 10:38 PM] Zeus#2212
well, good to know anyway hehe


[14-May-19 10:39 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Hahaha


[14-May-19 10:39 PM] arweave-sam#9630
All good  


[14-May-19 10:39 PM] Zeus#2212
maybe the arweave.js could throw an error when a 400 happens, so we can let the users know there was an error  


[14-May-19 10:39 PM] Zeus#2212
because it thinks it all worked fine but it didn't hehe


[14-May-19 10:39 PM] arweave-sam#9630

@Lyner Yep, the question is going to be whether we want to put all of these extra things inside the Arweave.js library or make extra 'util' libs


[15-May-19 07:38 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@arweave-kyle is going to complain about us bloating arweave.js  


[15-May-19 07:39 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We should also probably start writing simple data format specs for these kinds of apps, so that integration is simple


[15-May-19 07:40 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We need a kind of `ARFCeditor` for the weave  


[15-May-19 07:40 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Easy to just create smaller focussed libs, then just include what you need in each app


[15-May-19 07:44 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @benji  https://github.com/shenwilly/querweave/blob/master/js/get_username.js

In that example the code is simply getting the library's api object and posting an arql request, so it will return a promise which will resolve to the server response, here's the typescript source from the lib https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave-js/blob/master/src/common/lib/api.ts#L59

The arql endpoint returns an empty string if if doesn't have any matches `""`, or an array of results like `["yWDG5D_SITBfyD3V7nH8Unhf1FTVVZMiLiktO68FsOI","lPe4qJyfQ7SuYKm7AB-o3mn7iO_g24j0flbNbZV__-Q",]`

yeah prob better to make a specialized lib

The new version of weavemail now let's you specify a `?to=[address]` in the URL BTW, so that you can make programmatic links to send weave mails to people

@arweave-sam yeah, the style css requires external dependency and apparently the packaging didn’t parse it correctly?


[15-May-19 01:35 PM] Lyner#9077
followed kyle's suggestion and building it locally works tho


[15-May-19 01:45 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Very interesting, thanks

Thanks @arweave-sam the current version doesn't allow updates and this is something I put on the github repo:


[15-May-19 01:55 PM] Zeus#2212
What would be the best way to handle an app that already exists but we want to update the link? Should the first publisher be the only one able to edit this? Doesn't sound right.


[15-May-19 01:57 PM] Zeus#2212
was looking on a way to allow updating an already published app, without having everyone to put any link they want to, for now I prevent in JS for someone to release an app with the exact same name, so for an update it's to add for example WeaveMail v2 or something like that and it will allow it, but both apps will be there at the same time


[15-May-19 01:57 PM] Zeus#2212
ahhh thanks for the link, heard about it before on the phone but didn't know it was already available, amazing  


[15-May-19 02:16 PM] arweave-sam#9630
> Should the first publisher be the only one able to edit this? Doesn't sound right.

@Zeus That is kind of interesting. One of the cool things about open source permaweb apps is that they can be forked by other developers to add/change features. This is kind of like an 'update' in some ways, but the submitter will be from a different wallet. And to make things more complex, at some point we might be able to 'merge' permaweb apps (think about perhaps a social network that combines data from a blogging platform and a micro-blogging platform, perhaps).


[15-May-19 02:17 PM] arweave-sam#9630
So ideally the system would be able to track updates, forks, and merges  


[15-May-19 02:17 PM] arweave-sam#9630
But that is way too complex for now


[15-May-19 02:20 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Maybe we could name apps in a similar way to Github's repos?


[15-May-19 02:20 PM] arweave-sam#9630
`arweave-sam/weavemail` etc


[15-May-19 02:21 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Enabling the possibility to have a `zeus/weavemail`, etc


[15-May-19 02:39 PM] Zeus#2212
Ohhhh that's a nice idea @arweave-sam ! How about having the username from the ArweaveID /appnam ? In that case everyone could update their own published one.
I was thinking maybe just allow the wallet owner of an app to publish and update their links.


[15-May-19 04:34 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Nice -- that works!


[15-May-19 04:35 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Then if they fork it, they just rename it slightly


[15-May-19 04:35 PM] arweave-sam#9630
If others fork it, you end up with the GitHub-style naming system


[15-May-19 04:37 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I was thinking that short hashes for names (like git does) would be nice, too


[15-May-19 04:37 PM] arweave-sam#9630
But is there ever a situation where that might get in the way of app functionality?


[15-May-19 04:37 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Seems a bit dangerous to lose the info


[16-May-19 12:59 PM] arweave-sam#9630

We are revamping the open web hackathon page on Gitcoin


[16-May-19 01:00 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I want to link to the ArweaveApps index to give people an idea of the stuff they can build


[16-May-19 01:00 PM] Zeus#2212
ok, this version it's almost finished,


[16-May-19 01:00 PM] arweave-sam#9630
And maybe require that they upload there as part of the rules


[16-May-19 01:00 PM] arweave-sam#9630
But I can't get my app to submit?


[16-May-19 01:00 PM] Zeus#2212
need to finish the homepage to only show the latest app with an ID and it's done  


[16-May-19 01:01 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Awesome!  


[16-May-19 01:01 PM] Zeus#2212
oh nice idea  


[16-May-19 01:01 PM] Zeus#2212
yeah haha I commented the publish on the uploaded version by mistake, commented it locally to do tests on the links and uploaded it 🤣


[16-May-19 01:01 PM] Zeus#2212
same on github, that line is commented, noticed it this morning >.<


[16-May-19 01:03 PM] arweave-sam#9630
     


[16-May-19 01:03 PM] arweave-sam#9630
That is why I couldn't get it to work!


[16-May-19 01:03 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Haha


[16-May-19 01:03 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Ok, makes sense now


[16-May-19 01:04 PM] arweave-sam#9630
If you give me an @ when you have the next version ready and I will test it, and put it in the Gitcoin post


[16-May-19 01:04 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Also, I have been thinking about the browser idea


[16-May-19 01:05 PM] arweave-sam#9630
If it can hook into wildfire, sounds awesome


[16-May-19 01:05 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Happy to support it  


[16-May-19 01:06 PM] Zeus#2212
wildfire? this https://www.getwildfire.com/?


[16-May-19 01:06 PM] Zeus#2212
yes for sure I'll let you know when the newer version is ready  


[16-May-19 01:07 PM] Zeus#2212
is wildfire an expression? an app? hahah don't remember hearing about it if it's an app  


[16-May-19 01:07 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Nope  


[16-May-19 01:07 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It is our data distribution incentivisation system


[16-May-19 01:07 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It is kind of like Bittorrent's `optimistic tit-for-tat`


[16-May-19 01:08 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Except it uses rankings, not slots, and distributes new transactions and blocks based on past experiences with the node, too


[16-May-19 01:08 PM] Zeus#2212
omgaaa perfect, have any link where I could read about it? will let you know  


[16-May-19 01:09 PM] Zeus#2212
didn't know it was the name of the technique used, I read on the site how it worked, but didn't read the whitepaper yet


[16-May-19 01:09 PM] arweave-sam#9630
The lightpaper is pretty light, unfortunately


[16-May-19 01:09 PM] arweave-sam#9630
One of our big focuses is the yellow paper at the moment

A few months still, I think


[16-May-19 01:11 PM] arweave-sam#9630
The draft is currently ~35 pages


[16-May-19 01:11 PM] arweave-sam#9630
But we want to go for quality, not speed this time


[16-May-19 01:11 PM] Vilenarios#8742
i hear ya


[16-May-19 01:11 PM] Vilenarios#8742
let me know if you need any draft readers


[16-May-19 01:12 PM] Vilenarios#8742
i read/write a lot of lengthy technical docs all the time...


[16-May-19 01:12 PM] arweave-sam#9630
The Archain white paper and the Arweave light papers were both written under organisational time pressures


[16-May-19 01:12 PM] arweave-sam#9630
With the release of main net, etc


[16-May-19 01:13 PM] arweave-sam#9630
> let me know if you need any draft readers

@Vilenarios Yes please!


[16-May-19 01:13 PM] arweave-sam#9630
That would be great


[16-May-19 01:13 PM] arweave-sam#9630

@Zeus What do you think about having a `weavemail the author` button on ArweaveApps?


[16-May-19 01:30 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It might be a cool way to securely send bug reports


[16-May-19 01:34 PM] Zeus#2212
yes it's already in place ^_^ it's on the bottom right corner as an email icon, should it be better in text?

ArweaveID _everywhere_  


[16-May-19 03:26 PM] Zeus#2212
The app has been updated, but I'm having a problem doing the deploy, it's related to the --package option. https://github.com/GoldZeus/ArweaveApps


[16-May-19 03:26 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@Vilenarios It is a permission less system ;). But yeah, I know you have lots of time commitments


[16-May-19 03:26 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Maybe make one less miner and build a permaweb app?  


[16-May-19 03:26 PM] Zeus#2212
also tried to just do a package to create a local packaged version, same error: ```Unexpected token: punc (;)```


[16-May-19 03:26 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Thanks @Zeus


[16-May-19 03:26 PM] arweave-sam#9630
That is super strange


[16-May-19 03:27 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Must be something in the packaging library we use


[16-May-19 03:27 PM] Cilan#1165
I can't find much information on the Arweave token. The website says it's mined, so I'm assuming it's not an ERC20 token. Does it have smart contract capabilities or is it just used for the incentivization system?


[16-May-19 03:28 PM] Cilan#1165
Granted I've barely done my fair share of research before asking


[16-May-19 03:28 PM] Zeus#2212
does the packaging library uses UglifyJS? only place I see the same error is there, but it's related to es6 and I saw es6 on other apps


[16-May-19 03:28 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@Zeus Have you added any new dependencies in the latest version?


[16-May-19 03:29 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@arweave-kyle implemented the `--package` option, and it will be very late in his time zone right now I am afraid


[16-May-19 03:29 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@Cilan Arweave is its own network, totally separate from Ethereum etc. The token is used to pay for storage of data and reward miners for their efforts


[16-May-19 03:29 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Welcome to the community by the way  


[16-May-19 03:30 PM] Zeus#2212
new dependencies no but I changed a lot my source code, removed all typescript to es5 and replaced them with es6 js files


[16-May-19 03:30 PM] Cilan#1165
Alright, I can understand how static pages can be hosted in a decentralized system, but what about actual backend logic?


[16-May-19 03:30 PM] Zeus#2212
@Cilan welcome   yeah not using ERC20 nor any other smart contract like Ethereum  


[16-May-19 03:31 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Hmm


[16-May-19 03:31 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Have you tried running an ES6->ES5 transpiler on it first?


[16-May-19 03:31 PM] arweave-sam#9630
(BRB, call)


[16-May-19 03:31 PM] Zeus#2212
Arweave is more like storage than a full backend, you can host sites, use it as a perma database, things like that ^_^


[16-May-19 03:32 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
Hey @Zeus , do you get any more context around the error?


[16-May-19 03:32 PM] Cilan#1165
okay, so it's like swarm/ipfs


[16-May-19 03:33 PM] Zeus#2212
no @arweave-kyle but I do think is related to es6, will create a gulp task to convert them to es5 and see if that solves it  


[16-May-19 03:33 PM] Zeus#2212
http://prntscr.com/npjak6


[16-May-19 03:33 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Except fast, and with a database


[16-May-19 03:33 PM] Cilan#1165
in the github issue comment section i was told about the areweave wallet extension, so i thought maybe use that in my app instead of a custom token, but now it doesn't seem like that's possible


[16-May-19 03:33 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@Cilan


[16-May-19 03:33 PM] Cilan#1165
right


[16-May-19 03:33 PM] arweave-sam#9630
What is your app @Cilan ?


[16-May-19 03:34 PM] Cilan#1165
article posting basically


[16-May-19 03:34 PM] Cilan#1165
and you can give articles a token, which at the moment just does stuff through solidity


[16-May-19 03:35 PM] Cilan#1165
the authors get the token but it is updated in the article contract


[16-May-19 03:35 PM] Cilan#1165
so where arweave would fit in is hosting the article content


[16-May-19 03:35 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
@Zeus if you run deploy with `--debug` you might get some more info around what it's getting stuck at


[16-May-19 03:36 PM] Cilan#1165
since it's posted from the client side, the wallet extension would still be necessary i'm assuming for the fee of publishing it


[16-May-19 03:36 PM] arweave-kyle#4569

@Cilan data transactions can be signed and uploaded to the network in a browser with no extensions required, just need access to the jwk key file


[16-May-19 03:38 PM] Cilan#1165
okay


[16-May-19 03:38 PM] Zeus#2212
ohhh perfect thanks @arweave-kyle I've used inline-source before and I think I know now how to resolve it


[16-May-19 03:38 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
Ace!


[16-May-19 03:39 PM] Zeus#2212
the problem will be the javascript files I changed hehe

{Reactions}
  

[16-May-19 03:40 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
@Cilan for example https://weavemail.app (https://github.com/arweaveTeam/weavemail)  uses our JS library (https://github.com/arweaveTeam/arweave-js) to sign transactions and upload messages directly to the network all client side in the browser, so you could use it on mobile for example


[16-May-19 03:40 PM] Cilan#1165
i'm basically using ethereum to remove the need of a server for backend logic, and arweave to remove the need of a server for data storage


[16-May-19 03:42 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
Yeah that's totally doable -- we went to the ETH Paris hackathon and a bunch of people were using that model, arweave UI in a browser talking to an eth contract backend using web3 and metamask


[16-May-19 03:42 PM] Cilan#1165
great


[16-May-19 03:42 PM] Cilan#1165
i'm also using infura for people who don't have metamask


[16-May-19 03:42 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
The frontend arweave side was easy enough, the tricky part everyone had was with the eth side haha


[16-May-19 03:42 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
Ah cool!


[16-May-19 03:42 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
That makes it even easier


[16-May-19 03:42 PM] Cilan#1165
well i already kind of made everything on the eth side :p


[16-May-19 03:43 PM] Cilan#1165
but i was just prototyping with swarm because it's still alpha


[16-May-19 03:43 PM] Cilan#1165
nothing that could be mainnet


[16-May-19 03:45 PM] Cilan#1165
https://github.com/ExpandTeam/expand-app/tree/dev/truffle/contracts you can see the contracts here


[16-May-19 03:45 PM] Cilan#1165
i have to modify it to accept whatever the arweave version of a swarm hash is the rest should be the same


[16-May-19 03:48 PM] Cilan#1165
then i have to figure out all the key signing stuff you were talking about, then it should be good to go and actually useable on the mainnet


[16-May-19 03:52 PM] Cilan#1165
then how the arweave database stuff works. if i can learn how to index it, i can remove algolia and this would be completely decentralized


[16-May-19 03:53 PM] Cilan#1165
arweave isn't alpha, right? because this seems like a great opportunity to straight up just make my dApp mainnet ready as well. i'm a little concerned by the "get free tokens" thing


[16-May-19 03:55 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
Mainnet launched last summer  


[16-May-19 03:57 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
You can add arbitrary tags to data transactions when you upload them, and then anyone can search for them later using those tags

@Lyner made this question/answer platform using tags and ArQL for example

[16-May-19 03:58 PM] Cilan#1165
or keywords from it?


[16-May-19 03:58 PM] arweave-kyle#4569

[16-May-19 04:00 PM] Cilan#1165
all the questions asked there have the same tags?


[16-May-19 04:00 PM] Cilan#1165
so does he index them client side?


[16-May-19 04:00 PM] Cilan#1165
oh. there's no search feature


[16-May-19 04:01 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
It's all indexed on the node side, so there's no client side caching or indexing needed


[16-May-19 04:01 PM] Cilan#1165
i'll definitely take that as a best practice though for storing articles relevant to the dapp


[16-May-19 04:02 PM] Cilan#1165
right, but i'm talking about indexing the content of the question or its title for searching later


[16-May-19 04:02 PM] Cilan#1165
so, it's a database in the sense that you can use tags to get relevant data


[16-May-19 04:02 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
When the transactions get uploaded nodes index them using tags, then anyone (and any browser) can query the arql endpoint and ask the node for any transaction ids that match their search


[16-May-19 04:02 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
Yup!


[16-May-19 04:03 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
So you can serve the HTML/CSS.JS frontend from the network, and then you can also upload and search for other pieces of data too


[16-May-19 04:03 PM] Cilan#1165
cool


[16-May-19 04:04 PM] Cilan#1165
as long as the querying capabilities are advanced enough i will go ahead and just store the content of the articles, including their titles, into a tag alongside the other tags for app identification


[16-May-19 04:05 PM] Cilan#1165
would you say it's a good practice to host my own arql node


[16-May-19 04:05 PM] Cilan#1165
i don't want to bog down or get bogged down from one endpoint


[16-May-19 04:07 PM] Cilan#1165
i guess i'm asking moreso if i should worry about it lol


[16-May-19 04:09 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
ArQL is built directly into all nodes already, so you don't need to host your own node to use it


[16-May-19 04:10 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
You can ask any node in the network and they'll reply with all matching txs they know about,
```
curl -X POST \
  https://arweave.net/arql \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -d '{
    "op": "equals",
    "expr1": "App-Name",
    "expr2": "querweave"
}'
```

This will give you a list of questions from the app


[16-May-19 04:11 PM] Cilan#1165
okay, but i'm assuming not all nodes have all the txs right?


[16-May-19 04:11 PM] Cilan#1165
wait


[16-May-19 04:11 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
Then grab the first tx from the response
```
curl -X GET \
  https://arweave.net/tx/UkVdBAzVXs1KPESxG2f7kqeUDuESpM0ShkN-KbHcZbo \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -d '{
    "op": "equals",
    "expr1": "App-Name",
    "expr2": "querweave"
}'
```


[16-May-19 04:11 PM] Cilan#1165
they would if it functions like a blockchain


[16-May-19 04:12 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
Any node will reply with all the txs it knows about, so if the node has all blocks then it'll tell you every matching tx


[16-May-19 04:12 PM] Cilan#1165
interesting. this means every node attempts to retrieve all the data?


[16-May-19 04:13 PM] Cilan#1165
that wouldn't scale well i would think


[16-May-19 04:14 PM] Cilan#1165
oh, nevermind. i completely forgot how these sort of things work for a second


[16-May-19 04:14 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
If you replace arweave.net in the example above with any node IP address they'll tell you what they know about, not all nodes will have _all_ txs, but miners are incentivised to store as many blocks and txs as possible as they need those blocks and txs to mine, if a miner has 50% of blocks then they can only mine 50% of the time. The recall blocks required for mining are random so again miners are incentivised to store _everyones_ data


[16-May-19 04:16 PM] Cilan#1165
okay, then i guess for now at least i will use the arweave website's node and two others i find, but eventually it does seem like the best idea is to just host my own


[16-May-19 04:16 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
Miners all test each other too as part of their wildfire scores, nodes will prefer other nodes that have more txs, so nodes with more txs are prioritised for the distribution of new blocks which again helps mining


[16-May-19 04:18 PM] Cilan#1165
thank you for your help, kyle


[16-May-19 04:18 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
You can host your own, but best practice generally is to not hardcode a node IP or hostname directly into an arweave app, and instead simply use the window.location.host as the api base, then if the code is being served from arweave.net you'll get all the matching data that arweave.net knows about, but then you can go to the same app on a different node IP and they'll tel l you what they know about


[16-May-19 04:18 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
http://arweave.net/bNbA3TEQVL60xlgCcqdz4ZPHFZ711cZ3hmkpGttDt_U


[16-May-19 04:19 PM] Zeus#2212
wow you guys talked so much from where I started solving the issue hahaha


[16-May-19 04:19 PM] Cilan#1165
lol


[16-May-19 04:19 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
Same peer explorer app running on a different
 random node 45.32.158.231:1984/bNbA3TEQVL60xlgCcqdz4ZPHFZ711cZ3hmkpGttDt_U, etc etc  


[16-May-19 04:19 PM] Cilan#1165
okay, i'll do that instead. it does seem like a better idea. only, you said that the users don't need the wallet


[16-May-19 04:19 PM] Cilan#1165
and only their keys


[16-May-19 04:20 PM] Cilan#1165
i guess i can do what you said and additionally have hardcoded fallbacks


[16-May-19 04:20 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
Yeah that would work too


[16-May-19 04:21 PM] Cilan#1165
so, the arweave wallet extension injects window.location.host


[16-May-19 04:23 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
arweave.net is just a load balancer pointing to a couple of our nodes, the nodes don't touch the data they serve at all and don't inject anything in by default. It's not always web content being served, it's just arbitrary storage/data as far as the nodes are concerned


[16-May-19 04:24 PM] Cilan#1165
i'm asking about the wallet extension though, from what you said earlier


[16-May-19 04:24 PM] Cilan#1165
`instead simply use the window.location.host as the api base`


[16-May-19 04:25 PM] Cilan#1165
i would assume the wallet extension injects that variable and not something else


[16-May-19 04:26 PM] Cilan#1165
oh


[16-May-19 04:26 PM] Cilan#1165
you're saying that since the website is hosted through arweave, it will have the host*name* be the endpoint of the node it's on


[16-May-19 04:27 PM] Zeus#2212
that last part is accurate   every node has the hosted content


[16-May-19 04:28 PM] Zeus#2212
a website, image, etc  


[16-May-19 04:28 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
Yup! Just point back to the host thats serving the webpage itself  


[16-May-19 04:29 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
That way if a domain or IP changes the app still works  


[16-May-19 04:30 PM] Zeus#2212
^


[16-May-19 04:31 PM] Cilan#1165
i didn't even know that was a variable on the window location object


[16-May-19 04:33 PM] Cilan#1165
how do people generally create domain names for their arweave sites


[16-May-19 04:33 PM] Cilan#1165
for my purposes i was originally planning on simply hosting the website itself by myself because i already have a vps that hosts static sites


[16-May-19 04:34 PM] Cilan#1165
arweave is already immensely useful for the other data i'm going to store on it


[16-May-19 04:34 PM] Cilan#1165
in that case, i would have to hardcode


[16-May-19 04:37 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
We're working on shipping custom hostnames baked into the node software directly soon, so you'll simply be able to use a CNAME record on your domain to point your domain to a specific arweave gateway node, and then add a TXT record to tell the node which transaction id to serve and that's it -- you just need to buy a domain and you can upload your code using arweave deploy, no server required


[16-May-19 04:37 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
Similar principle for how things like github pages work with custom domains


[16-May-19 04:38 PM] Cilan#1165
in that case, i'll just have my domain point to txn on one of the endpoints


[16-May-19 04:38 PM] Cilan#1165
until that feature's released


[16-May-19 04:40 PM] Cilan#1165
that would definitely mess up window.location.host though i would think


[16-May-19 04:41 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
Yeah there's a few details to work out, but we're working on a bunch of stuff to make this as simple and 'just works' as possible


[16-May-19 04:41 PM] Cilan#1165
okay


[16-May-19 04:41 PM] Cilan#1165
actually, i'm not going to have a domain right now and just do what you mentioned earlier

Cool cool, we'll be sure to let everyone know when the feature is ready to go -- it's already in testing so not too long to wait  


[16-May-19 04:42 PM] arweave-sam#9630
You are relentless @arweave-kyle


[16-May-19 04:42 PM] arweave-sam#9630

Are you waiting up to see block 200,000?  


[16-May-19 04:44 PM] arweave-sam#9630
37 blocks now


[16-May-19 04:44 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@Zeus Did you work out the problem?


[16-May-19 04:44 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I tried to read up, but you guys exchanged 80+ messages while I was on the phone  


[16-May-19 04:45 PM] Cilan#1165
nothing important was said between me and kyle, he was basically just explaining to me some good practices based on what arweave does


[16-May-19 04:45 PM] Cilan#1165
i have everything i need to make the app now

Awesome!


[16-May-19 04:46 PM] arweave-kyle#4569
I'll head off now -- keep us updated @Cilan with how you get on


[16-May-19 04:48 PM] Cilan#1165
sure, i think in a few days i'll have something ready

Happ y hacking @Cilan !


[16-May-19 04:50 PM] Zeus#2212
@arweave-sam yes   just finishing up a few small details I noticed while testing everything on Arweave  


[16-May-19 04:50 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Awesome


[16-May-19 04:50 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I noticed some more uploads of the new vesion


[16-May-19 04:50 PM] arweave-sam#9630
*version


[16-May-19 04:50 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Looks very nice


[16-May-19 04:51 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Now I use @Mazzz 's `WeaveWatcher` as my homepage I keep getting distracted by all the new stuff on the weave when I open a new tab  


[16-May-19 04:51 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Really cool to see, not great for productivity  


[16-May-19 04:54 PM] Zeus#2212
hahaha yeah the first day I joined I stayed looking at that page for quite some time 🤣


[16-May-19 04:55 PM] Vilenarios#8742
what was weave watcher URL again?


[16-May-19 04:55 PM] Zeus#2212
@Mazzz created the first procrastination permaweb hahah  


[16-May-19 04:55 PM] Vilenarios#8742
stick that on Arweave Apps


[16-May-19 04:56 PM] Vilenarios#8742
I guess since @Mazzz owns it, perhaps he should set it up there


[16-May-19 04:56 PM] arweave-sam#9630

[16-May-19 04:57 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep, with the new version of ArweaveApps, @Mazzz will have to submit the app himself, right @Zeus ?

Nice


[16-May-19 05:01 PM] arweave-sam#9630

@Zeus I see you've made ArweaveApps right?


[16-May-19 05:03 PM] Mazzz#1871
How will you deal with double ups of apps?


[16-May-19 05:04 PM] Zeus#2212
hey there @Mazzz  


[16-May-19 05:04 PM] Cilan#1165
there's not really a way to deal with double ups


[16-May-19 05:04 PM] Cilan#1165
just let it be


[16-May-19 05:04 PM] Cilan#1165
imo


[16-May-19 05:04 PM] Zeus#2212
yes, we talked yesterday and came up with the idea that any "fork" from another user will be part of the site


[16-May-19 05:05 PM] Zeus#2212
but if the same owner uploads an app with the same title as a previous one, it will be "updated" to the newer version  


[16-May-19 05:06 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Kind of like Github fork naming @Mazzz


[16-May-19 05:06 PM] Zeus#2212

Wow so ArweaveID works across all permaweb apps right?


[16-May-19 05:11 PM] Zeus#2212
all apps can work accross all permaweb apps, and even non-permaweb apps if you interact with the blockchain  


[16-May-19 05:11 PM] Zeus#2212
yes ^_^


[16-May-19 05:11 PM] arweave-sam#9630

it is!


[16-May-19 05:12 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I think it is the first app that makes use of the 'unsilo'ed nature of data on the Arweave


[16-May-19 05:12 PM] Zeus#2212
ok, latest version is up to date and being uploaded now   will be available on the next block! https://arweave.net/52Sv0286YsidcbDwmxX-PqgDM2h25hQVZj8-nDJGeuE

@Mazzz if you can add your site link in there when ready will be awesome, also will help to see if everything is fine


[16-May-19 05:13 PM] Cilan#1165
ill put mine in there when it's done


[16-May-19 05:13 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I will also submit Message In a Bottle


[16-May-19 05:13 PM] Zeus#2212
you created that one @arweave-sam ?  


[16-May-19 05:13 PM] arweave-sam#9630
And make a bot that pings us here when someone publishes something new


[16-May-19 05:14 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Haha, just a Sunday afternoon project  


[16-May-19 05:14 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Bots everywhere!


[16-May-19 05:14 PM] Zeus#2212
it was so funny to see all those "probably" hahah


[16-May-19 05:14 PM] arweave-sam#9630
My problem is that even when not working on my core Arweave stuff ... I just want to build Arweave apps  


[16-May-19 05:14 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Can't help it lol


[16-May-19 05:15 PM] Zeus#2212
wait what? did my balance ended or what? lol I got this message for the first time:
```
D:\projects\ArweaveApps>arweave status 52Sv0286YsidcbDwmxX-PqgDM2h25hQVZj8-nDJGeuE

```


[16-May-19 05:15 PM] Zeus#2212
ok balance I still have enough


[16-May-19 05:15 PM] Zeus#2212
not sure what is that error haha


[16-May-19 05:16 PM] Zeus#2212
it's when I check the transaction status


[16-May-19 05:16 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Haha yeah @Zeus -- at first I didn't want to over promise on message delivery, but then I thought the 'probably's were actually pretty funny


[16-May-19 05:16 PM] arweave-sam#9630
`410 Gone` means 'I had the TX at some point, but for some reason I decided to drop it'


[16-May-19 05:16 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Normal causes:


[16-May-19 05:16 PM] Cilan#1165
right, i wanted to ask about that. why does the website offer free tokens when people can just use the test network? i hope it's not inflating the token or anything?


[16-May-19 05:16 PM] arweave-sam#9630
1. Data was mined into a block, but then the node fork recovered to a different block that didn't have the data


[16-May-19 05:17 PM] arweave-sam#9630
2. The TX got clobbered by another message to the mempool


[16-May-19 05:17 PM] Zeus#2212
ahh I get it   ok so I will deploy again  


[16-May-19 05:18 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@Cilan There is no test network at the moment, nor is there an exchange with which you can buy AR right now


[16-May-19 05:18 PM] Zeus#2212
@Mazzz the link is this one, older one decided to drop it   https://arweave.net/P7QTD0g_umbnW4fsOHKSm3vz2yuaTeHB05zyUENlUyk

[16-May-19 05:19 PM] Cilan#1165
i just want to make sure it's safe for me to make my app available on the eth mainnet


[16-May-19 05:19 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Understandable -- we are working on it. We have signed listing agreements with exchanges that the community will be happy with, the trouble is that integration is much more complex than with an ERC-20, or even another BTC/ETH/monero fork.


[16-May-19 05:19 PM] Zeus#2212
gosh, everytime we have to wait for a block, it doesn't matter if it comes in a minute or 30 seconds, it always feels like an eternity!  


[16-May-19 05:20 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yes, it is safe to do @Cilan


[16-May-19 05:20 PM] Zeus#2212
it is @Cilan this is the mainnet that will remain


[16-May-19 05:20 PM] Cilan#1165
okay, good


[16-May-19 05:20 PM] Zeus#2212
your apps are now permanent  


[16-May-19 05:20 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep, we need to spin up a testnet with 20 second block time or something


[16-May-19 05:20 PM] Zeus#2212
even those that you say I don't want anyone to see anymore hahaha


[16-May-19 05:21 PM] Zeus#2212
omg! I just got another idea!


[16-May-19 05:21 PM] Zeus#2212
will write this one before I forget it haha


[16-May-19 05:22 PM] Cilan#1165
i need to start doing that with all my ideas


[16-May-19 05:22 PM] arweave-sam#9630
 


[16-May-19 05:22 PM] arweave-sam#9630
What is it @Zeus ?


[16-May-19 05:22 PM] Zeus#2212
I have so many that I need to write them haha


[16-May-19 05:23 PM] Cilan#1165
my showerthoughts are all in the void


[16-May-19 05:23 PM] Zeus#2212
this one is simple, for fun  


[16-May-19 05:23 PM] Zeus#2212
a big search box, the person enters an address, and we can see all the sites that address has  


[16-May-19 05:23 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I have been wanting to build a 'thought lab' app on the weave for this reason @Cilan


[16-May-19 05:23 PM] arweave-sam#9630
A permanent store of good ideas, so you don't forget them


[16-May-19 05:24 PM] arweave-sam#9630
+++ @Zeus


[16-May-19 05:24 PM] Zeus#2212
showerthoughts, had some of my best ideas in there, and some important ones lost in the void too hahaha


[16-May-19 05:24 PM] Cilan#1165
reminds me of year in pixels


[16-May-19 05:24 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Very cool


[16-May-19 05:25 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I hadn't seen that before @Cilan -- interesting idea


[16-May-19 05:25 PM] Mazzz#1871
Yeah so many ideas that go unrealised haha.


[16-May-19 05:26 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Buckminster Fuller did something very similar, except he logged chunks of 15 minutes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dymaxion_Chronofile @Cilan

 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dymaxion_Chronofile
Dymaxion Chronofile
The Dymaxion Chronofile is Buckminster Fuller's attempt to document his life as completely as possible. He created a very large scrapbook in which he documented his life every 15 minutes from 1920 to 1983. The scrapbook contains copies of all correspondence, bills, notes, ske...


[16-May-19 05:26 PM] Mazzz#1871
I have an idea for a permaweb pixel image, like the thing Reddit did a few years back


[16-May-19 05:26 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Would be awesome to have something like that on the weave


[16-May-19 05:26 PM] Zeus#2212
15 minutes?? he did just that for all his life then o.O


[16-May-19 05:27 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yeah, that resolution is completely bizarre in my opinion


[16-May-19 05:27 PM] arweave-sam#9630
But the basic concept is kind of interesting


[16-May-19 05:27 PM] Cilan#1165
today it'd be easier to just wear a gopro 24/7


[16-May-19 05:27 PM] Zeus#2212
yey ArweaveApps is up   https://arweave.net/P7QTD0g_umbnW4fsOHKSm3vz2yuaTeHB05zyUENlUyk


[16-May-19 05:28 PM] Zeus#2212
hahaha true @Cilan


[16-May-19 05:28 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I imagine he would have been pretty upset if he lost those diaries... Arweave would have been better  


[16-May-19 05:28 PM] Zeus#2212
a reality show I think they are called now 🤣


[16-May-19 05:28 PM] Zeus#2212
well, reality shows are more fake than normal shows so a gopro life needs to have a new name  


[16-May-19 05:29 PM] arweave-sam#9630
      @Zeus  !


[16-May-19 05:29 PM] Vilenarios#8742
Will arweave ever come to a mobile wallet?


[16-May-19 05:29 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yes  


[16-May-19 05:29 PM] Vilenarios#8742
A mobile wallet that syncs your pics


[16-May-19 05:29 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I think Viewblock are actually building a mobile wallet


[16-May-19 05:29 PM] Vilenarios#8742
And can integrate with your arweaveID and weavemail


[16-May-19 05:30 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yeah, I was trying to convince them to make it nudge you when you get a weavemail


[16-May-19 05:30 PM] Vilenarios#8742
This is the kind of ecosystem that will set Arweave apart if u ask me


[16-May-19 05:30 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep


[16-May-19 05:31 PM] Cilan#1165
what's enough to set arweave apart is just that it works and is incentivized


[16-May-19 05:31 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Hahaha  


[16-May-19 05:31 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It helps :p


[16-May-19 05:31 PM] Cilan#1165
i mean that's the bar right now


[16-May-19 05:31 PM] Cilan#1165
obviously it'll raise when swarm gets out of alpha, etc


[16-May-19 05:31 PM] Cilan#1165
big chain db too


[16-May-19 05:32 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Ocean terminated BigChainDB unfortunately, if I understand correctly


[16-May-19 05:33 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@arweave-lev used to be on the BigChain team


[16-May-19 05:33 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It was a nice idea  


[16-May-19 05:33 PM] Cilan#1165
seemed promising


[16-May-19 05:33 PM] Zeus#2212
a few years back I was part of Qora, a coin that wanted to do just what Arweave realized, decentralized web, I was working with them for just 2 months for a javascript plugin, when I got in I saw they had nothing done, nothing worked as it was supposed


[16-May-19 05:33 PM] Zeus#2212
I was able to see a few sites, but even the deploy was broken if we had more than a simple `<p>hello world</p>` told the owner and he was so mad, he had spent so much time and money with his project


[16-May-19 05:34 PM] Zeus#2212
well, it ended real quick


[16-May-19 05:34 PM] Zeus#2212
so I'm so happy to see Arweave  


[16-May-19 05:34 PM] Zeus#2212
and that it works! haha


[16-May-19 05:34 PM] arweave-sam#9630
 


[16-May-19 05:34 PM] arweave-sam#9630
A decentralised web is actually a super old idea


[16-May-19 05:35 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I was reading the Cryptonomicon a while ago, and they had a whole section discussing it


[16-May-19 05:35 PM] arweave-sam#9630
And that was.... 1990 or so?


[16-May-19 05:35 PM] Cilan#1165
someone i know told me he was working with tim berners lee at apple or something when tim told him about his idea for the world wide web. apparently he thought it was a terrible idea and decided not to join him


[16-May-19 05:36 PM] Zeus#2212
omg haha ^


[16-May-19 05:36 PM] arweave-sam#9630
     


[16-May-19 05:36 PM] Cilan#1165
i would think it's terrible too


[16-May-19 05:36 PM] Cilan#1165
these days people are afraid of TeX


[16-May-19 05:37 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@Zeus when I press 'PUBLISH APP', where do I actually put the TXID please?  


[16-May-19 05:37 PM] Zeus#2212
as you said Cilan, having an ethereum idea + a permaweb is amazing too, this is one of the things I always talk to crypto friends. yes the backend is decentralized, but the frontend isn't


[16-May-19 05:37 PM] arweave-sam#9630
  Zeus, yep


[16-May-19 05:37 PM] Cilan#1165
well the limitation is ethereum smart contracts becoming very expensive given too much data


[16-May-19 05:37 PM] Cilan#1165
also it being generally a bad idea to store stuff like all user accounts in them


[16-May-19 05:38 PM] Zeus#2212
for sure ^


[16-May-19 05:38 PM] Cilan#1165
you need some sort of cache as well to group the contracts under your app then


[16-May-19 05:38 PM] Cilan#1165
unless you're brave and add them all to another contract made specifically for storing that


[16-May-19 05:38 PM] Zeus#2212
what you mean @arweave-sam ?


[16-May-19 05:38 PM] Cilan#1165
i just generally really love the ethereum foundation, i've been mining their coin since 2016


[16-May-19 05:39 PM] Zeus#2212
wow, I joined ETH in 2016 too, but never mined it


[16-May-19 05:39 PM] Zeus#2212
http://prntscr.com/npkn3z is this what you see @arweave-sam ? you should have all the apps you published there with the title taken from the <title> tag of your content


[16-May-19 05:39 PM] arweave-sam#9630
When I click the publish app button I am not sure where to put the TXID that the app is stored in


[16-May-19 05:39 PM] Cilan#1165
in 2012 i was solo mining ltc on my cpu and never got a single one


[16-May-19 05:40 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Ohhhhh


[16-May-19 05:40 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Whhhhhaaaaa


[16-May-19 05:40 PM] Cilan#1165
but some btc faucets around that time got me like 30 cents which is now like 3 dollars


[16-May-19 05:40 PM] arweave-sam#9630
That is _so much cooler than I expected_ !


[16-May-19 05:41 PM] Zeus#2212
hehehe well I wanted to finish the first version quick since I wanted to prove I can do it, but wasn't happy with it  


[16-May-19 05:41 PM] Cilan#1165
did you come from gitcoin


[16-May-19 05:41 PM] Cilan#1165
ready for your sweet cash


[16-May-19 05:41 PM] Zeus#2212
yep  


[16-May-19 05:41 PM] Cilan#1165
eth not cash


[16-May-19 05:41 PM] Cilan#1165
same


[16-May-19 05:41 PM] Zeus#2212
haha eth yeah  


[16-May-19 05:42 PM] Cilan#1165
i found out about gitcoin from a Brave ad


[16-May-19 05:42 PM] Cilan#1165
the brave ads give me much more than expected


[16-May-19 05:42 PM] Cilan#1165
i think i got like $5 for getting ads over one month


[16-May-19 05:42 PM] Zeus#2212
hahaha same @Cilan


[16-May-19 05:42 PM] Zeus#2212
but I didn't get anything, account is still at 0! -.-


[16-May-19 05:42 PM] Cilan#1165
:/


[16-May-19 05:42 PM] Zeus#2212
at least I got to know gitcoin and Arweave  


[16-May-19 05:42 PM] Cilan#1165
i got $2 worth of BAT in may


[16-May-19 05:43 PM] Cilan#1165
yeah. i got no traction from my dapp but i feel like this will help


[16-May-19 05:43 PM] Cilan#1165
i went to internapalooza and some guy from google wanted to discuss it with me but never responded on linkedin (he asked me to send him a message there)


[16-May-19 05:43 PM] Zeus#2212
have you tried to publish your site with them @Cilan ?


[16-May-19 05:44 PM] Zeus#2212
I tried and they put me in a waitlist -.- for one of my sites lol


[16-May-19 05:44 PM] Cilan#1165
nah


[16-May-19 05:44 PM] Cilan#1165
i only really wanted a small community because i was in alpha as long as swarm was


[16-May-19 05:46 PM] Zeus#2212
I don't even have a linkedin :V been an indie dev all my life hehe


[16-May-19 05:46 PM] Cilan#1165
i just want to have some savings before startuplandia


[16-May-19 05:47 PM] Zeus#2212
went to school to get a diploma to get a job (literally, I knew more than the teachers -.-) but never worked for a big company, working on my own or small teams hehe


[16-May-19 05:47 PM] Cilan#1165
it's hard to be an indie dev or freelancer rn


[16-May-19 05:47 PM] Cilan#1165
i hope that's not the case for me, i go to college next year


[16-May-19 05:48 PM] Cilan#1165
i really didn't want to go but i figured i'd get bored without my friends


[16-May-19 05:48 PM] Zeus#2212
yeah the crypto sphere has been so good to me, I made my name known thanks to showing what I can do, and a chance, because I'm not good with Resumes, LinkedIn, etc :/


[16-May-19 05:48 PM] Cilan#1165
yeah forget it


[16-May-19 05:49 PM] Cilan#1165
triplebyte maybe


[16-May-19 05:49 PM] Cilan#1165
nothing else really works unless you have friends on the inside


[16-May-19 05:49 PM] Zeus#2212
exactly, and I don't have lol


[16-May-19 05:49 PM] Cilan#1165
wait you said you have a college degree


[16-May-19 05:50 PM] Cilan#1165
where do you live lol


[16-May-19 05:50 PM] Zeus#2212
Montreal, Canada


[16-May-19 05:50 PM] Zeus#2212
@arweave-sam where you able to publish your link? ^_^


[16-May-19 05:50 PM] Cilan#1165
no jobs there? crazy


[16-May-19 05:50 PM] Zeus#2212
well no idea hehe been an indie dev


[16-May-19 05:51 PM] Cilan#1165
did you go to mcgill


[16-May-19 05:51 PM] Zeus#2212
but since last month I was trying to find some here and it was or really bad, or I never got a call


[16-May-19 05:51 PM] Zeus#2212
but I'm telling you, pretty sure my resume doesn't look so good lol I know they are software that your text need to be able to pass so a real human can read it

[16-May-19 05:52 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I am trying to make a map of the bit of the ecosystem that was built in the last week, and its interconnections


[16-May-19 05:52 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Does this look right?


[16-May-19 05:52 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I feel I am missing stuff  


[16-May-19 05:53 PM] Cilan#1165
whats arweaveid


[16-May-19 05:53 PM] Zeus#2212
ArweaveID is implemented in Querweave?


[16-May-19 05:53 PM] Zeus#2212
nice  


[16-May-19 05:53 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep!


[16-May-19 05:54 PM] Zeus#2212
https://arweave.net/fGUdNmXFmflBMGI2f9vD7KzsrAc1s1USQgQLgAVT0W0 this @Cilan


[16-May-19 05:54 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@Cilan It is a service for associating humans and contact details with wallets


[16-May-19 05:54 PM] Zeus#2212
it allow your wallet to have a name ^_^


[16-May-19 05:54 PM] Cilan#1165
good


[16-May-19 05:54 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Then you can easily embed it in your app


[16-May-19 05:54 PM] Zeus#2212
yes  


[16-May-19 05:54 PM] Cilan#1165
i can replace signing a message with eth public key then storing the given username in mongodb with that


[16-May-19 05:55 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I think it has space for ETH addresses too, @Lyner ?


[16-May-19 05:55 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Nice @Cilan !


[16-May-19 05:55 PM] Zeus#2212
http://recordit.co/t1KtuBhc8G here's a video of how it works


[16-May-19 05:55 PM] Zeus#2212
instead of showing the address, it shows my name


[16-May-19 05:55 PM] Cilan#1165
does it do eth addresses? that would be great


[16-May-19 05:56 PM] Zeus#2212
if it doesn't by default, a simple fork will do it  


[16-May-19 05:56 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I think there is a problem with ArweaveApps if you have uploaded too many TXs, @Zeus ?


[16-May-19 05:56 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I am getting:
```

[16-May-19 05:57 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I guess we need @Lyner to submit ArweaveID to ArweaveApps before it shows up now, too?  


[16-May-19 05:57 PM] Zeus#2212
argg I forgot a console.log there that wasn't supposed to be there -.-


[16-May-19 05:57 PM] arweave-sam#9630
D:


[16-May-19 05:57 PM] arweave-sam#9630
lol


[16-May-19 05:57 PM] Zeus#2212
showing useless info that was for my tests


[16-May-19 05:58 PM] Zeus#2212
anyway haha can you post what you saw before that error on the console pls?  


[16-May-19 05:58 PM] Zeus#2212
for me nothing is showing other than ArweaveApps that I submitted


[16-May-19 05:58 PM] Zeus#2212
did you submit yours @arweave-sam ?


[16-May-19 05:59 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I tried  


[16-May-19 06:00 PM] arweave-sam#9630

ok that one is the login


[16-May-19 06:00 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Login?


[16-May-19 06:00 PM] Zeus#2212
logged in user apps  


[16-May-19 06:01 PM] Zeus#2212
and right after that you get the error?


[16-May-19 06:01 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It is Chronolock: https://arweave.net/xqx3Ua8VBQLgdKqlI4gtZdVoXxLLF8csKn5in-joJqo


[16-May-19 06:01 PM] Zeus#2212
ohh I know what it is


[16-May-19 06:01 PM] Zeus#2212
is my regex


[16-May-19 06:01 PM] arweave-sam#9630
 


[16-May-19 06:02 PM] Zeus#2212
it gets me the <title> content of a page


[16-May-19 06:02 PM] Zeus#2212
but what if the page doesn't have a title tag lol


[16-May-19 06:02 PM] arweave-sam#9630
(Great idea btw)


[16-May-19 06:02 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Hahaha


[16-May-19 06:02 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Oops


[16-May-19 06:02 PM] Zeus#2212
probably something is broken there


[16-May-19 06:02 PM] Zeus#2212
haha thanks  


[16-May-19 06:03 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I need to put together a talk for the Loki snappathon tomorrow


[16-May-19 06:03 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We were going to demo SILO working end to end


[16-May-19 06:03 PM] arweave-sam#9630
But we haven't stuck together the two halves yet


[16-May-19 06:03 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Fingers crossed  


[16-May-19 06:04 PM] Zeus#2212
good luck!! hope it's done soon!  


[16-May-19 06:06 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Speak to you later!


[16-May-19 06:06 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Good luck wit the bug  


[16-May-19 06:06 PM] Zeus#2212
solved it, I knew what it was haha


[16-May-19 06:07 PM] Zeus#2212
will do more tests before uploading again  


[16-May-19 06:07 PM] Zeus#2212
later!  


[16-May-19 06:20 PM] arweave-sam#9630

nice icon too haha  


[16-May-19 06:58 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Hahaha


[16-May-19 06:58 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Thank you  


[16-May-19 06:58 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It looks so pretty!


[16-May-19 06:58 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Amazing job


[16-May-19 06:59 PM] Zeus#2212
I like I changed the colors, before that blue... didn't like it that much haha  


[16-May-19 06:59 PM] Zeus#2212
Thanks @arweave-sam  


[16-May-19 07:01 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I will add submitting your app to ArweaveApps as the final step in the hackathon instructions now


[16-May-19 07:02 PM] arweave-sam#9630
And because it respects 'consumer integrity', there is no need to fear that you will turn it into a rick roll  


[16-May-19 07:02 PM] arweave-sam#9630
(Not that you would, of course   )


[16-May-19 07:02 PM] arweave-sam#9630
But now if we refer to it by ID, you cannot change it at all


[16-May-19 07:04 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@Lyner Please can you add ArweaveID and Querweave?


[16-May-19 07:04 PM] arweave-sam#9630
And WeaveWatcher, @Mazzz ?


[16-May-19 07:04 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I am afraid that I cannot do it now  


[16-May-19 07:04 PM] arweave-sam#9630
(Only the person with the upload key can)


[16-May-19 07:04 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@Zeus Does every app still need an icon?


[16-May-19 07:05 PM] Zeus#2212
the icon yes


[16-May-19 07:05 PM] Zeus#2212
before I had a big banner but felt it was too much haha


[16-May-19 07:05 PM] Zeus#2212
would it be better without the icon?


[16-May-19 07:05 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I think the icons look really nice


[16-May-19 07:05 PM] Zeus#2212
I mean, optional?


[16-May-19 07:06 PM] Zeus#2212
yeah I like it because it's easier to find an app too


[16-May-19 07:06 PM] arweave-sam#9630
But I worry that some devs won't have the art skills for it  


[16-May-19 07:06 PM] arweave-sam#9630
(I certainly don't   )


[16-May-19 07:06 PM] Zeus#2212
instead of having to read everything haha


[16-May-19 07:06 PM] Zeus#2212
haha


[16-May-19 07:09 PM] Zeus#2212
we will need to have weavemail in there too  


[16-May-19 07:09 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep, I can't upload though because of the lack of icon


[16-May-19 07:11 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I was thinking that a W with an M right below it, in the font used on the weavemail homepage might be good


[16-May-19 07:11 PM] arweave-sam#9630
But I don't even have the design skills for that  


[16-May-19 07:12 PM] arweave-sam#9630
If this goes well, we could use ArweaveApps as the homepage for the https://arweave.net gateway


[16-May-19 07:12 PM] arweave-sam#9630
At the moment it is a bit... dry  


[16-May-19 07:12 PM] Zeus#2212
Yeah I went to see the css theme you use there Milligram, I like it  


[16-May-19 07:13 PM] Zeus#2212
was thinking of using it as the about:blank of the browser too hehe


[16-May-19 07:13 PM] arweave-sam#9630
 


[16-May-19 07:13 PM] arweave-sam#9630
That would be great


[16-May-19 07:13 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Although I still love weave watcher haha


[16-May-19 07:13 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Fun to see the new stuff


[16-May-19 07:14 PM] Zeus#2212
what is weave-watcher link? want to have it open haha


[16-May-19 07:14 PM] Zeus#2212
yeah exactly


[16-May-19 07:14 PM] Zeus#2212

It was something that was built ages ago


[16-May-19 07:15 PM] Zeus#2212
it's saying undefined in your username, while message in a bottle has the right one :V


[16-May-19 07:15 PM] arweave-sam#9630
'ages' being a relative term  


[16-May-19 07:15 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Not my wallet


[16-May-19 07:15 PM] Zeus#2212
ages in tech term haha


[16-May-19 07:15 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Not a bug  


[16-May-19 07:15 PM] Zeus#2212
not a bug? is that wallet called undefined?


[16-May-19 07:15 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Oh


[16-May-19 07:15 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Sorry


[16-May-19 07:16 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I just saw what you mean


[16-May-19 07:16 PM] arweave-sam#9630
No, that is definitely a bug  


[16-May-19 07:16 PM] Zeus#2212
locally it's showing an address


[16-May-19 07:16 PM] Zeus#2212
while there it's showing undefined hahaha


[16-May-19 07:16 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Hahaha


[16-May-19 07:16 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Weird


[16-May-19 07:16 PM] Zeus#2212
nice (or bad) name to have hahaha  


[16-May-19 07:16 PM] Zeus#2212
people will be omg what's going on now, and it's just the name the person put to his addy :V


[16-May-19 07:17 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I rue-loaded it from a wallet with no ArweaveID


[16-May-19 07:17 PM] Zeus#2212
when you login with that wallet, does it say undefined too at the top right corner?


[16-May-19 07:17 PM] Zeus#2212
or it's showing the address?


[16-May-19 07:24 PM] arweave-sam#9630

yeyyyy someone posted weavemail  


[16-May-19 07:27 PM] Zeus#2212
it will be so good to have all the links in one place


[16-May-19 07:35 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Definitely :D


[16-May-19 07:36 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It is amazing how far the ecosystem has come in a short period


[16-May-19 07:37 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Thanks helping out!


[16-May-19 07:39 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Did you make the logo for ArweaveApps @Zeus ?


[16-May-19 07:39 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It is very nice  


[16-May-19 07:40 PM] Zeus#2212
I didn't haha have a few that I got for free and even for commercial use so used that one


[16-May-19 07:41 PM] Zeus#2212
not that good creating logos/icons haha


[16-May-19 07:41 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Haha, I see


[16-May-19 07:42 PM] Zeus#2212
it's true that it can be hard to get good logos and without attributions etc, maybe it's a good idea to remove the icons?


[16-May-19 07:43 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Maybe we could just leave a blank space if the uploader does not provide an icon?


[16-May-19 07:44 PM] Zeus#2212
still look good without icons http://prntscr.com/nplkgt


[16-May-19 07:45 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It does, but it is not so 'colourful'


[16-May-19 07:45 PM] Zeus#2212
yes haha


[16-May-19 07:46 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Does it look ok with a mix?


[16-May-19 07:47 PM] Zeus#2212
mmm what do you think? http://prntscr.com/npll7n


[16-May-19 07:49 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Pretty good?


[16-May-19 07:49 PM] Zeus#2212
I think it's ok, I can do it this way and we can see how it looks after more apps are in


[16-May-19 07:49 PM] Zeus#2212
links


[16-May-19 07:50 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yeah, sounds good :)


[16-May-19 07:50 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I am afraid I must run though


[16-May-19 07:50 PM] arweave-sam#9630

Wow @benji !


[16-May-19 09:46 PM] arweave-sam#9630
That is amazing!


[16-May-19 09:49 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It looks _really_ smooth


[16-May-19 09:51 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I will start posting some of our blogs to it when I next have access to my keys  


[16-May-19 09:51 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Have you published it to @Zeus 's ArweaveApps index?


[16-May-19 09:52 PM] arweave-sam#9630
That will get it some exposure :)


[16-May-19 09:53 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We will also add 'view this blog on the permaweb' links to our Medium posts, which should help with distribution


[16-May-19 09:53 PM] arweave-sam#9630
As soon as it is well tested we will move to it as a primary publishing mechanism  


[16-May-19 09:56 PM] Zeus#2212
hey @benji nice addition! it's something I was thinking about and that for sure it's nice to have! a medium/steemit permaweb  


[16-May-19 09:56 PM] Zeus#2212
Latest release of ArweaveApps is https://arweave.net/35IFq9BcIgpSPti9YDYDiaQy4wMfMIKZ25t7hHZrhek which have optional icons on publish and some other small changes  


[16-May-19 10:01 PM] Zeus#2212
Good night guys  


[16-May-19 10:38 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep @Zeus


[16-May-19 10:38 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It is a really nice addition


[16-May-19 10:39 PM] arweave-sam#9630
People have been asking to start blogs on the Arweave for a while


[16-May-19 10:39 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@Zeus night!


[16-May-19 10:44 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Nice changes btw, I think the optional logos might make it more likely to become _the_ index in the long-term. Makes it a no-brainer for devs to submit  


[16-May-19 11:16 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Hey @benji -- I just tried out Scribe


[16-May-19 11:16 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It is so high quality!


[16-May-19 11:17 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Really is amazing  


[16-May-19 11:17 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I totally didn't expect the awesome WYSIWIG text editor


[16-May-19 11:18 PM] arweave-sam#9630
And I kept trying to comma separate my tags because I wasn't expecting the tag management system to be so sophisticated  


[16-May-19 11:18 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It is seriously well built


[16-May-19 11:18 PM] arweave-sam#9630

Mentioned your app on a relevant Hacker News post @benji   : https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19936413

[17-May-19 03:04 AM] benji#5402
Thanks @arweave-sam it was quite fun putting it together. There are a lot of rough edges which I would have liked to knock off, and also left out some must-haves which I just didn't have time to address (I'm pretty sure there's some serious security issues which would need to be addressed to make it production ready)


[17-May-19 03:08 AM] benji#5402
Also it would be quite straight forward to break the client, since it's not parsing the incoming data on the client to filter out invalid fields; any determined person could pretty easily break the layouts of it etc.


[17-May-19 03:23 AM] benji#5402
I will put together some feedback on the API as well when I have time :)


[17-May-19 06:54 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Thanks @benji !


[17-May-19 06:54 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Please can you DM the security issues that you know of?


[17-May-19 06:54 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Also, have you uploaded it to ArweaveApps?


[17-May-19 06:55 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@Zeus I am wondering if it would be better if everyone could submit an app, and then the owner could always 'override' the submission later?


[17-May-19 06:56 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I am thinking that asking each individual person to submit it might not work out so well

Could always have both models


[17-May-19 07:27 AM] Vilenarios#8742
one where the owner submits it - perhaps its "starred" or something


[17-May-19 07:27 AM] qqsergey#1638
Wts arweave (escrow only)


[17-May-19 07:27 AM] Vilenarios#8742
sam, great idea for the logical diagram that shows the layers being build on top of permanent storage


[17-May-19 07:42 AM] Zeus#2212
Good morning  


[17-May-19 07:43 AM] Zeus#2212
@arweave-sam but if we do this, we are back to not knowing how to deal with "updates" since anyone will be able to update the link of any site, and also I think it's best if the owner of the page publish it that way he knows about ArweaveApps and will update it there when they do an update of their apps too


[17-May-19 07:44 AM] Lyner#9077
that's so cool @benji very polished  


[17-May-19 07:45 AM] Zeus#2212
Hey good morning @Lyner  


[17-May-19 07:45 AM] Lyner#9077
morning, its evening here :P


[17-May-19 07:49 AM] Zeus#2212
  Evening then haha  


[17-May-19 07:50 AM] benji#5402
Thanks !  


[17-May-19 07:50 AM] benji#5402
I was thinking a bit about upgradeability


[17-May-19 07:51 AM] benji#5402
in my case, in terms of releasing updated versions of an article, or updating a profile with a info


[17-May-19 07:52 AM] Lyner#9077
I also need to implement those for Querweave  


[17-May-19 07:52 AM] benji#5402
ah yea


[17-May-19 07:52 AM] Lyner#9077
> updating a profile with a info


[17-May-19 07:53 AM] Lyner#9077
you could use ArweaveID if you want


[17-May-19 07:53 AM] benji#5402
do you have something created already that serves this purpose ?


[17-May-19 07:53 AM] Lyner#9077
 


[17-May-19 07:53 AM] Zeus#2212
for profile with info it's best you use ArweaveID since @Lyner implemented it and it will be cool that it's used everywhere  


[17-May-19 07:53 AM] Zeus#2212
I already implemented it in ArweaveApps

btw @Lyner don't forget to publish your app https://arweave.net/35IFq9BcIgpSPti9YDYDiaQy4wMfMIKZ25t7hHZrhek  


[17-May-19 07:54 AM] benji#5402
Nice, does it have support for a thumbnail image ?


[17-May-19 07:54 AM] Lyner#9077
there is no field for profile yet but it'd be easy to add


[17-May-19 07:54 AM] Lyner#9077
and thumbnail also


[17-May-19 07:54 AM] Zeus#2212
yeah will need an avatar in there Lyner  


[17-May-19 07:54 AM] Zeus#2212
some sites might need that part


[17-May-19 07:54 AM] benji#5402
Brilliant. I held off on addressing anything along those lines, as I heard you had made something of that nature


[17-May-19 07:54 AM] Lyner#9077
@Zeus will do after I finish major features  


[17-May-19 07:55 AM] Lyner#9077
also do you use any front end framework for your app @benji ?


[17-May-19 07:55 AM] benji#5402
It's React, Typescript and Material UI

{Reactions}
 

[17-May-19 08:07 AM] benji#5402
I might as well not have used typescript, the dev was taking way longer then I wanted so I started cutting corners and ignoring TS  


[17-May-19 08:07 AM] benji#5402
Scribe : any

{Reactions}
  

[17-May-19 08:07 AM] Zeus#2212
hahah happened the same to me benjo, my first version was built in Typescript but the second version I decided to go only es6


[17-May-19 08:08 AM] benji#5402
Yep, it's good for big projects, but I've found for prototyping it slows me down


[17-May-19 08:09 AM] Zeus#2212
I haven't done any es6 in a while, been using typescript forever now, but I mostly do work in NodeJS so it's not a big problem over there anymore


[17-May-19 08:09 AM] Zeus#2212
on the web it's slows down the work for sure


[17-May-19 08:11 AM] benji#5402
Yup, I like using it on the server as well - are you using a framework ?


[17-May-19 08:15 AM] Zeus#2212
for the site? no, built from scratch


[17-May-19 08:18 AM] benji#5402
sorry thought you were saying you used TS for backend


[17-May-19 08:18 AM] Zeus#2212
ah no, I mean on my normal jobs I work with NodeJS and Typescript all the time


[17-May-19 08:18 AM] Zeus#2212
but for this one it was just easier to go with es6  


[17-May-19 08:19 AM] benji#5402
Yup


[17-May-19 08:19 AM] Zeus#2212
and no backend other than using Arweave  


[17-May-19 08:19 AM] benji#5402

Hey @Yogurt - Do you want to drop me a PM and I can help you? Could be that you need to contact Upvest support directly.


[17-May-19 09:25 AM] benji#5402
The Arweave blockchain, is it based on BTC


[17-May-19 09:26 AM] Yogurt#0312
Thanks india. And sorry for same message in three channel.


[17-May-19 09:26 AM] arweave-india#5075
It's okay Yugg, happy to help  


[17-May-19 09:26 AM] Yogurt#0312
I will contact Upvest support first.


[17-May-19 09:26 AM] benji#5402
Is there any view of how Arweave will behave with interoperable platforms in the future ?


[17-May-19 09:28 AM] arweave-india#5075
@benji - Not as such, it's a novel 'blockweave' data structure rather than the BTC blockchain. I'm afraid I can't speak to interoperability, I'll leave that to one of our core node developers to address! Perhaps if @arweave-sam is available he may be able to explain :).


[17-May-19 09:32 AM] benji#5402
Thanks india, I will try to pick his brain when he's around

[17-May-19 09:50 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Thanks!


[17-May-19 09:50 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I want to demo `Scribe`, ArweaveApps, and ArweaveID


[17-May-19 09:50 AM] arweave-sam#9630
But ArweaveID, Querweave and Scribe are not on ArweaveApps


[17-May-19 09:51 AM] arweave-sam#9630
So I will have to use my offline index:


[17-May-19 09:52 AM] arweave-sam#9630
'index' lol  


[17-May-19 09:52 AM] Lyner#9077

Do you have the latest link for Querweave?

Awesome! Thank you  


[17-May-19 10:23 AM] arweave-sam#9630
When I tell people about Querweave they always look at me strangely when I first say the name  


[17-May-19 10:23 AM] benji#5402
I wonder if there's any way of making deeplinks happen for the react apps running on arweave


[17-May-19 10:23 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Is the idea that it sounds a bit like 'query'-weave?


[17-May-19 10:23 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@Lyner


[17-May-19 10:24 AM] Lyner#9077
I actually spell it like Qoor weave


[17-May-19 10:24 AM] Lyner#9077
but I guess it doesn't actually sound like that lol


[17-May-19 10:24 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Seems like it should be possible @Lyner ?


[17-May-19 10:24 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Haha, I see


[17-May-19 10:24 AM] arweave-sam#9630
So pronounced like 'Quorweave'?


[17-May-19 10:24 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I have been saying something more like 'Queerweave'


[17-May-19 10:26 AM] benji#5402
I'm trying to think ahead longer term for things like SEO


[17-May-19 10:26 AM] Lyner#9077
yeah queerweave is actually the proper english spelling, but I was going for Q-r-weave


[17-May-19 10:29 AM] Lyner#9077
@benji I'm also trying to find a solution actually


[17-May-19 10:30 AM] Lyner#9077
I guess I'm going to compromise for short term solution for now, like appending # to the url


[17-May-19 10:30 AM] Lyner#9077
@arweave-sam something like this? https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=auto&tl=en&text=Q'r%20weave


[17-May-19 10:32 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Yeah using hash fragment navigation is the way to go I think, and most/all popular routing libs should support it


[17-May-19 10:33 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
The other routing methods don't really work well in a portable way


[17-May-19 10:34 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Fair point though @benji about SEO, fragment urls won't really do so well


[17-May-19 10:36 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I used a simple `?to=[address]` with weavemail


[17-May-19 10:36 AM] arweave-sam#9630
But I don't know if React will work with that kind of approach


[17-May-19 10:42 AM] arweave-kyle#4569
Yeah query params are separate so any js lib should be able to handle them fine


[17-May-19 10:44 AM] benji#5402
great


[17-May-19 10:44 AM] benji#5402
I will look at integrating them  


[17-May-19 10:46 AM] arweave-sam#9630
 


[17-May-19 11:51 AM] tiamat#9131
Quorweave definitely needs a new name, like qweave, askweave,  smartweave,  topicweave, weavedebate, weavequiz, etc  


[17-May-19 11:52 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@Lyner Mentioned that he was open to a tip curated renaming contest?


[17-May-19 11:53 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We have a policy in the core team: because everything we build is open, so we have no ownership of the ideas/products, if you come up with the IP: You name it   .


[17-May-19 11:54 AM] arweave-sam#9630
This is how we ended up with such weird algorithm names  


[17-May-19 11:54 AM] arweave-sam#9630
`Wildfire` nearly ended up as `SharingIsCaring` for this reason

Thanks Sam, released it about an hour ago but had to leave before it was deployed haha

[17-May-19 06:49 PM] Zeus#2212
haven't uploaded it yet to github so the github and the links at the bottom doesn't work yet but wanted to see if everything was right on a packaged version  


[17-May-19 06:50 PM] Zeus#2212

We should probably attach a domain to ArweaveApps so we can find it easily now

Maybe @arweave-kyle knows the best way to do this right now?

The archive is very neat @Zeus


[17-May-19 11:24 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Gives a kind of 'shortcut' to find an older version of an app that you liked more than the new version


[18-May-19 01:41 AM] arweave-india#5075
@Zeus On the Decentralised Public Library videos? Yes indeed, that's me! 

Just want to say to everyone- all the new updates and new apps are looking so awesome, good job all! We have been wanting some of these apps to exist for ages and ages, so it's really excellent to see!

oh nice to meet you @arweave-india hehe

Thanks @arweave-sam  


[18-May-19 02:02 PM] benji#5402
@arweave-sam Nice, that's good to know - I won't spend any time on queries for it.
quick question tho - when I request a document from the server, does it always send the entire document to me, or is it possible to just request different fields ?

Ideally I'd like to be able to request the X most recent documents which match certain tags, and then only download x, y and z from the server.


[18-May-19 02:04 PM] benji#5402
Looking forward to V2  


[18-May-19 02:05 PM] benji#5402
Another Q - Where is AR on the subject of interoperability ? Are atomic swaps possible / will they be possible in the future ?


[18-May-19 04:08 PM] arweave-sam#9630
> Where is AR on the subject of interoperability ? 

Yep, have looked at a few different chains, and mechanisms of connecting them


[18-May-19 04:08 PM] arweave-sam#9630
There are a few people at the ETHNewYork hackathon, for example embedding Arweave TXIDs inside smart contracts


[18-May-19 04:08 PM] arweave-sam#9630
(in one way or another)


[18-May-19 04:10 PM] arweave-sam#9630
> and then only download x, y and z from the server.
Download fields of the TX, you mean @benji ?


[18-May-19 04:10 PM] arweave-sam#9630
If so, yes you can do that, but some nodes have it turned off by default


[18-May-19 04:11 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I will check if the arweave.net gateways enable it


[18-May-19 04:12 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@benji  Yep!

No worries!  


[18-May-19 05:06 PM] benji#5402
and is it possible to filter fields in a request based on their size


[18-May-19 05:35 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Ooooo


[18-May-19 05:36 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I don't think so at the moment, no


[18-May-19 05:37 PM] benji#5402
that could come in handy, there's a situation where, for instance, someone could upload a huge payload for the data of an article


[18-May-19 05:38 PM] benji#5402
Or, for instance, I use tags for data to do with the article, and on the client I limit the length of these at the input


[18-May-19 05:38 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep, makes a lot of sense

@arweave-sam to answer first question, download selected tags and or data from tx

I'm tempted to hold off for a while though, if v2 or the arql API is coming out


[19-May-19 12:39 PM] benji#5402
I would like to know more about the best practices / parameters of what's possible before going on.

Probably not advisable to wait on it

[19-May-19 01:26 PM] benji#5402
Would it be possible to get some more info on the existing arql API, I could add search by tag to scribe

or cypto in general


[19-May-19 09:59 PM] Mazzz#1871

maybe we should have a dedicated channel for the bots? also whale bot no longer working?

[20-May-19 12:49 PM] arweave-sam#9630
  This is EdLock, an app that @JustMaier helped build at ETHNewYork


[20-May-19 12:49 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It stores an encrypted document on the Arweave with a split threshold key, held by N random people.


[20-May-19 12:51 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It has a neat mechanism design that incentivises the key holders to come together at a specific point in the future and decrypt and release the document publicly


[20-May-19 12:51 PM] arweave-sam#9630
The key holders don't have to know each other either, they just have to know that they will get a large reward if they submit their part of the key after a certain time


[20-May-19 12:51 PM] arweave-sam#9630
The keys themselves are just QR codes, so they can be handed out to random people


[20-May-19 12:52 PM] arweave-sam#9630
It is basically like a much, much better version of 'MessageInABottle'


[20-May-19 12:52 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Vitalik also helped us whiteboard the mechanism design for 5 minutes

For sure

I am totally biased, but I was really surprised that it wasn't chosen as one of the finalists  


[20-May-19 12:56 PM] JustMaier#0425
At least the finalist were cool projects. I'm really interested in the Ultralight mesh-net. I really like that idea and if it's done right it could be a good fallback layer for a bunch of different protocols


[20-May-19 12:57 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yes


[20-May-19 12:57 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Garrett and I were actually chatting about building a kind of similar thing with plug computers this weekend


[20-May-19 12:58 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Arweave nodes you can just plug into the wall and they start to mirror + mine


[20-May-19 12:58 PM] arweave-sam#9630
With optional 4G fallback if the wifi goes down

What is the max file size? it says file is too large when I try a file


[20-May-19 01:42 PM] JustMaier#0425
1.8MB


[20-May-19 01:43 PM] JustMaier#0425
If I understand correctly, a TX can't be large than 2MB at the moment


[20-May-19 01:44 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yeah, we will increase the max TX size with `faster-write`


[20-May-19 01:44 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Old apps should automatically support it


[20-May-19 01:51 PM] Zeus#2212
oh ok good to know, didn't knew about that limit  


[20-May-19 01:53 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Yeah, the way around it for now is just to chain the transactions via links to other hashes in the tags

The language is actually extremely simple
Might just be best to look at the parser itself: https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/blob/55e7347417ef5b388790aa180b39facf0b6306e7/src/ar_parser.erl#L14

Or even just this comment:
%% @Doc Evaluate a logical expression. Expressions can take three forms
%% {and, EXPR1, EXPR2} - the intersection of the sets returned by 'EXRP1' and 'EXPR2'
%% {or, EXPR1, EXPR2} - the union of the sets returned by 'EXPR1' and 'EXPR2'
%% {equals, KEY, VAL} - the set of txs for which key 'KEY' equals val 'VAL'

@tiamat You sure that the first answer in question 3 has 2 digits?


[23-May-19 07:38 AM] tiamat#9131
yes

[23-May-19 03:07 PM] aurora#3501
whats the answer for death ?


[23-May-19 03:14 PM] pogo#7729
`5 7 10:01 18 90 Dead Sea Bd6 Apple 039` were the answers


[23-May-19 03:20 PM] aurora#3501
nice one


[23-May-19 03:22 PM] HDGreg#5322
That feeling when I got all the answers more than hour ago. Except the 4. Dead Sea


[23-May-19 03:22 PM] HDGreg#5322
I had Dead End...


[23-May-19 03:22 PM] HDGreg#5322
Maybe next time try making a puzzle with only 1 correct asnwer


[23-May-19 03:22 PM] HDGreg#5322
Spent over an hour spamming all my timer numbers from 80 to 110.. Was ready to say it was rigged, as it was


[23-May-19 03:23 PM] HDGreg#5322
And make it harder, this was a joke of a puzzle in my opinion


[23-May-19 03:25 PM] tiamat#9131
@HDGreg I totally understand your frustration if you had 6/7 but 9 hours  until it got solved is decent


[23-May-19 03:25 PM] HDGreg#5322
It was sent to me 2 hours ago tho


[23-May-19 03:26 PM] tiamat#9131
there were 200+ challengers


[23-May-19 03:27 PM] HDGreg#5322
Sure. But I still firmly believe that Dead End is dead but never was alive


[23-May-19 03:28 PM] pogo#7729
to be honest "end" isn't an object that exists in real life...


[23-May-19 03:28 PM] pogo#7729
it's an expression, so it's not really dead


[23-May-19 03:29 PM] HDGreg#5322
Maybe you are correct. English isnt my first language and I see no difference in that


[23-May-19 03:30 PM] tiamat#9131
Stay tuned for the next one  


[23-May-19 03:30 PM] pogo#7729
but I agree, the difficulty could be increased a bit ^^


[23-May-19 03:31 PM] tiamat#9131
the best system is probably to start with a smaller amount and reward gets increased every day


[23-May-19 03:32 PM] HDGreg#5322
I will be staying tuned for the next one for sure

Thanks! Unrelated but for some reason outside emojis (including animated ones) arent allowed here... Is that something you enforce or its a just a bad setting?


[23-May-19 03:54 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Sounds like a bad setting?

Under @ everyone role you need to enable "use external emojis"


[24-May-19 03:16 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Hey @Scale @pogo, were you trying to add custom emojis from a different server? I just enabled it now, but I think that was the problem. So far, others have been able to use standard emojis in this server   :arweave:

Thanks  @arweave-sam, I have some more cosmetic things to push, and. Working on the profile today, hopefully get that and thumbnails integrated this week


[24-May-19 06:12 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Awesome!


[24-May-19 06:12 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Will the profiles thing be a separate app, kind of like ArweaveID?


[24-May-19 07:00 AM] benji#5402
So it'll be a standalone app, but I'll integrate it into scribe in some measure.


[24-May-19 07:01 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Ah, that is really cool  


[24-May-19 07:02 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I wonder if we can keep the same standard as ArweaveID underneath?


[24-May-19 07:05 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Seems like over time the standards for data storage are going to become almost as important as the apps themselves

@arweave-martin _just_ launched the Arweave RandomX testate this morning


[24-May-19 07:45 AM] Vilenarios#8742
So if I understand it you guys are getting 150k in funding to do this?


[24-May-19 07:45 AM] arweave-sam#9630
No, we are splitting the funding of the audits


[24-May-19 07:45 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I think in total there will be 4 or so


[24-May-19 07:45 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We are covering the first one


[24-May-19 07:45 AM] arweave-sam#9630
(Already underway)


[24-May-19 07:46 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We will be able to publicly publish the audit results (on the permaweb, of course   ) for this one


[24-May-19 07:46 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Which is nice


[24-May-19 07:46 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Some auditors get very embarrassed about having their writing out in public


[24-May-19 07:47 AM] arweave-sam#9630
(Lest there be spelling mistakes, etc)


[24-May-19 07:49 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Publishing auditing results on permaweb.... you should contact EVERY accounting firm with that proposition  


[24-May-19 07:49 AM] Vilenarios#8742
although i think they tend to only keep such records for a few years


[24-May-19 07:50 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yes, that is a very good use case


[24-May-19 07:50 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Some of those audit results, by law, have to be kept for many years


[24-May-19 07:51 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Same thing with certain legally required docs for companies. In the UK you need to keep evidence of employers liability insurance for 40 years.


[24-May-19 07:52 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Given how difficult it is to set a system like that up (all of the cloud storage offerings will have changed numerous times in 40 years), I bet most companies are not doing this properly.


[24-May-19 07:53 AM] Vilenarios#8742
Oh yeah, you cant even begin to imagine the non-technical complexities with handling information management policies and data retention


[24-May-19 07:54 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Haha, yep

[24-May-19 08:17 AM] benji#5402
also


[24-May-19 08:17 AM] benji#5402
it's not quite out of alpha yet


[24-May-19 08:19 AM] benji#5402
@arweave-sam I will have a look at shape of the data (I think this is what you mean by standard) which ArweaveId uses.


[24-May-19 08:41 AM] benji#5402
Or, do you mean the `arweave-id App-Name` namespace


[24-May-19 08:41 AM] benji#5402
I was intending to give it it's own namespace


[24-May-19 08:49 AM] benji#5402
I wasn't intending on overlapping the values, I'm planning for the profile to have the following fields : `thumbnail`, `pseudonym`, `title`, `about`, `location`, `bannerImg`


[24-May-19 08:50 AM] benji#5402
and maybe one or two others, but honestly I would like to keep it as anonymous as possible, so not necessarily linking to any real world data about a person's identity

{Reactions}

[24-May-19 08:51 AM] benji#5402
Very much modelling the realness of identity on twitter - people will have the option to say as much or as little as they like about themselves...


[24-May-19 09:03 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
Sure @benji, i'll update those now, i'll DM you before I share anything in future - just to make sure you're happy with everything!


[24-May-19 09:03 AM] benji#5402
thanks - yes the platform needs a bit of work still

{Reactions}
  

[24-May-19 09:07 AM] Lyner#9077
@benji @arweave-sam perhaps we can come up with a new universal tag for public identity data? So each app can plug in without worrying about overlapping "specialized" fields with the "general" fields, while we can have a universal app where users can monitor all their public informations on the weave in one place


[24-May-19 09:09 AM] Lyner#9077
also about Querweave's deadline, good point. Monday sounds good?


[24-May-19 09:11 AM] benji#5402
sounds good Lyner


[24-May-19 09:12 AM] benji#5402
Would you be able to clarify - I'm understanding that


[24-May-19 09:13 AM] benji#5402
it would be possible to query something like                
             `expr1:
                    {
                        op: 'equals',
                        expr1: 'data-type',
                        expr2: 'public-id-data'
                    },
                expr2:
                    {
                        op: 'equals',
                        expr1: 'from',
                        expr2: address,
                    }`


[24-May-19 09:14 AM] Lyner#9077
yeah I was thinking something like that


[24-May-19 09:15 AM] benji#5402
That sounds good - I would be happy to follow along with whatever you guys suggest - I'm still not 100% on best practices for querying / storing data etc


[24-May-19 09:16 AM] benji#5402
Actually, Lyner, maybe you could help me with something - I'm thinking about versioning for the profile


[24-May-19 09:16 AM] JustMaier#0425
@Lyner I agree, it'd be good to start some kind of registry for network-level datapoints


[24-May-19 09:16 AM] JustMaier#0425
So that apps could use common data


[24-May-19 09:16 AM] benji#5402
at the moment I'm thinking to include a tag `ipseity-profile-version` which starts at 1


[24-May-19 09:16 AM] JustMaier#0425
Perhaps eventually bake it into the client libraries


[24-May-19 09:17 AM] benji#5402
and each time it's updated the number is incremented


[24-May-19 09:18 AM] benji#5402
does that sound like an OK way to do this, or would you think there's more appropriate method ?


[24-May-19 09:18 AM] Lyner#9077
@JustMaier yup!


[24-May-19 09:18 AM] Lyner#9077
@benji ah, we want to get the latest one right?


[24-May-19 09:18 AM] benji#5402
yup


[24-May-19 09:19 AM] Lyner#9077
The approach I used with ArweaveID is to just resubmit the data with unix timestamp


[24-May-19 09:21 AM] Lyner#9077
and then just sort them on the front end


[24-May-19 09:21 AM] Lyner#9077
basically the same, but less tags


[24-May-19 09:21 AM] benji#5402
right, timestamp is better


[24-May-19 09:22 AM] Lyner#9077
I was hoping ArQL's future version would have more sophisticated queries to solve this  more efficiently  


[24-May-19 09:22 AM] benji#5402
Yep


[24-May-19 09:22 AM] benji#5402
it would be great to be able to just get the most recent


[24-May-19 09:22 AM] benji#5402
I'd also love to be able to filter out data at the node level


[24-May-19 09:23 AM] benji#5402
have you thought at all about app-breaking values that could be submitted to the api


[24-May-19 09:24 AM] benji#5402
data being the wrong shape


[24-May-19 09:24 AM] benji#5402
that sort of thing


[24-May-19 09:28 AM] Lyner#9077
haven't experimented a lot, but I didn't think much about it and just serializes all the datas to json format  


[24-May-19 09:29 AM] Lyner#9077
which should be pretty safe


[24-May-19 09:30 AM] Lyner#9077
also should consider using a more efficient format in the future


[24-May-19 09:53 AM] Lasse Clausen#6198
I like the term "Forever Blog"


[24-May-19 09:54 AM] Lasse Clausen#6198
making deep links to individual blog posts easily discoverable would be great!

Nice idea @Lasse Clausen   I think @benji is already working towards some updates, as mentioned in the 0.0.1 notes here: https://arweave.net/VOKAC_SYiUzbJrEaIY5SEBh1pf0bGQOd8c7G68nzet4#/view/OtXNHPfKidXdtce190sPyhlk4WwWrq6iMPTbUziZPNo

Not sure whether deep-linking to individual blog posts is in the pipeline yet. You can use http://permanently.online/ TXid - but it's still pretty long

[24-May-19 11:22 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Correct me if I am wrong, @benji , but I think links to specific blog posts are already possible? @Lasse Clausen


[24-May-19 11:22 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Also, yes @benji @Lyner , ArQLv2 offers support for typical SQL style `LIMIT 1` results  


[24-May-19 11:25 AM] arweave-sam#9630
And sounds good re:name at @Lyner  


[24-May-19 11:25 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I think it might be wise if we start putting together simple docs that describe how we store stuff like ID info, blog posts


[24-May-19 11:26 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We need a permaweb app that provides an interface for editing and displaying those 'standards'


[24-May-19 11:26 AM] arweave-sophie#4476
I thought @Lasse Clausen meant custom deep-linking, but maybe I misread. It is indeed possible to link directly to specific blog posts, it’s mentioned in the 0.0.1 release notes  


[24-May-19 11:27 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Then when you submit a TX, you can tag the transaction to show 'this TX abides by the standard found in [TXID]'


[24-May-19 11:27 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Anyone up for building that, if we put up a bounty?


[24-May-19 11:28 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We should probably start this standardising effort fairly soon, as once the tags are written, we can't rewrite them  


[24-May-19 11:28 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@JustMaier and I just spoke about the results of the community call form, too

_Any_ WebAssembly code is pretty powerful too


[24-May-19 11:59 AM] JustMaier#0425
Awesome!


[24-May-19 11:59 AM] arweave-sam#9630
LLVM can export WebAssembly, right?


[24-May-19 11:59 AM] arweave-sam#9630
So does that mean... we can generically run any code, in basically any language, in this l2 solution?


[24-May-19 11:59 AM] JustMaier#0425
Yeah, there are several languages that can export WebAssembly. very interesting.


[24-May-19 12:00 PM] JustMaier#0425
I'd love to talk with them more


[24-May-19 12:00 PM] arweave-sam#9630

1700 Berlin time work?


[24-May-19 12:19 PM] arweave-sam#9630
@JustMaier


[24-May-19 12:20 PM] JustMaier#0425
If that's the only time available, I can make that work. If after the call works, that'd be even better for me


[24-May-19 12:21 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Afraid not


[24-May-19 12:21 PM] arweave-sam#9630
They are east of me  


[24-May-19 12:21 PM] JustMaier#0425

Hi @Lasse Clausen , sam's correct, you can link to articles through the url there.


[24-May-19 02:43 PM] benji#5402
@arweave-sam that's awesome, a typescript starter with interfaces & validators for the standards would be good


[24-May-19 02:45 PM] arweave-sam#9630
That's a very neat idea @benji


[24-May-19 02:46 PM] Lasse Clausen#6198
@benji how do I get the deep link


[24-May-19 02:46 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Maybe it makes sense to make the 'standards' computer readable in some way


[24-May-19 02:46 PM] arweave-sam#9630
So parsers can be auto-generated


[24-May-19 02:48 PM] benji#5402
a class generator... that'd be nice


[24-May-19 02:51 PM] benji#5402
@Lasse Clausen make sure you're using the latest version, can be found at http://permanently.online


[24-May-19 02:53 PM] benji#5402
if you click on an article


[24-May-19 02:54 PM] benji#5402
the address there in the address bar is a deep link


[24-May-19 03:56 PM] Lasse Clausen#6198

@tiamat  what was the answer to the puzzle?


[24-May-19 07:23 PM] benji#5402
@arweave-sam is there any plans to develop `timed hash lock contracts` for arweave ?


[25-May-19 04:39 AM] arweave-sam#9630
EdLock does this already


[25-May-19 04:39 AM] arweave-sam#9630
@benji


[25-May-19 04:39 AM] arweave-sam#9630
But best to get @JustMaier to guide you through setting it up


[25-May-19 04:39 AM] benji#5402
Ahhh so it exists :)


[25-May-19 04:39 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I don't think there are actually any instructions on the page


[25-May-19 04:42 AM] benji#5402
Nice... I am involved with community of another blockchain proj focussed on interoperability, if I had some docs I could show the dev them there


[25-May-19 04:45 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Interesting!


[25-May-19 04:45 AM] benji#5402
Atomic swaps etc, OTC desk min order Val is a bit steep


[25-May-19 04:45 AM] benji#5402
For weave


[25-May-19 04:45 AM] arweave-sam#9630
EdLock is a purely layer two thing


[25-May-19 04:47 AM] arweave-sam#9630
It stores the timelocked payload on the weave, generates a threshold encrypted key with SSSS, then uses an ETH smart contract to incentivise people:
1. Not to submit their keys too early.
2. Submit their keys after/at a certain time.


[25-May-19 04:47 AM] arweave-sam#9630
It isn't very user friendly right now, unfortunately


[25-May-19 04:48 AM] benji#5402
API is there though I guess


[25-May-19 04:48 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The API on this one is partially humans


[25-May-19 04:49 AM] arweave-sam#9630
 


[25-May-19 04:49 AM] arweave-sam#9630
You have to generate a bunch of QR codes, then physically distribute them to people


[25-May-19 04:50 AM] arweave-sam#9630
All the data is still on the weave of course, but the program for generating the QR codes etc is not programmatically accessible


[25-May-19 04:50 AM] arweave-sam#9630
(correct me if I am wrong @JustMaier )


[25-May-19 04:51 AM] benji#5402
Very interesting, I was talking to Stu from Lamden last night about arweave on the subject of interoperability, he mentioned that as long as there's hash locked time contracts, it's simple enough to add new protocols


[25-May-19 04:55 AM] benji#5402
Would love to collect a bit of info about this stuff


[25-May-19 04:57 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Ahhh, I think we were talking at cross purposes


[25-May-19 04:58 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I thought you meant time locking data on the weave for decryption later -- which is what EdLock does @benji


[25-May-19 04:58 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Unfortunately, the Arweave does not currently support contracts of _any_ kind


[25-May-19 04:58 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The transactions simply carry data


[25-May-19 05:00 AM] arweave-sam#9630
This is mostly a result of the need to memoize the state of the whole blockweave into each single block, so that new miners can join the network without downloading large amounts of data


[25-May-19 05:00 AM] arweave-sam#9630
(And are rewarded proportionately for the extra data that they do store)


[25-May-19 05:01 AM] benji#5402
Right, and the timed hash locked contracts, they wouldn't be supported by  the existing transactions


[25-May-19 05:01 AM] benji#5402
As far as I know, atomic swaps reply on multi sig functionality and the ability for the multisig contract to expire


[25-May-19 05:02 AM] benji#5402
Idk exactly how they work (not a blockchain engineer)


[25-May-19 05:02 AM] benji#5402
But that's beyond the capabilities of arweave at this moment ?


[25-May-19 05:05 AM] arweave-sam#9630
It wouldn't work with the current system, unfortunately


[25-May-19 05:06 AM] arweave-sam#9630
The problem is essentially that of state size


[25-May-19 05:07 AM] arweave-sam#9630
If you have pending transactions between blocks, when you join the network you need to download all of the information about them so that you can correctly process new transactions


[25-May-19 05:10 AM] benji#5402
No worries. On another matter, I have been looking into writing a script for defining standards


[25-May-19 05:11 AM] benji#5402
Probably a ts-node application, basic idea at the moment would be to define data schema and rules in Json / typescript


[25-May-19 05:13 AM] benji#5402
And it would create JavaScript validators and typescript interfaces and types from this data


[25-May-19 05:15 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Interesting!


[25-May-19 05:15 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I can imagine that the language that we use to define the 'languages' (standards) might be fairly contentious  


[25-May-19 05:15 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Will you be on the call on Monday @benji ?


[25-May-19 05:16 AM] benji#5402
Yup


[25-May-19 05:16 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Nice  


[25-May-19 05:17 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I think the main thing is going to be making it easy for apps in the future (say 10 years) to 'understand' the old standards and integrate the data easily into new apps


[25-May-19 05:17 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Kind of like 'auto-backwards compatibility' perhaps?


[25-May-19 05:32 AM] benji#5402
Yup


[25-May-19 05:47 AM] benji#5402
I was thinking some sort of xml or json definitions of the shape of the data for a given application


[25-May-19 05:48 AM] benji#5402
Then a script which allows you to spit that out into ts / js whichever

Could be a permaweb app


[25-May-19 06:43 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep :)


[25-May-19 06:45 AM] arweave-sam#9630
If we make the standard simple enough to parse, it should be possible to generate 'adaptors' to port old TXs into new standards with whatever programming languages we are using in 20 years


[25-May-19 06:45 AM] arweave-sam#9630
But we should definitely make sure we 'get it right' from the start  


[25-May-19 06:45 AM] arweave-sam#9630
I will see if @arweave-ivan can come along to our call on Monday


[25-May-19 06:46 AM] arweave-sam#9630
He has a PhD related to linguistics


[25-May-19 06:46 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Perhaps he can help us not screw it up :p


[25-May-19 06:59 AM] benji#5402
Fabulous


[25-May-19 07:08 AM] Mazzz#1871
@arweave-sam Any chance the call could be recorded? Very interested in what everyone has to say but it's too late in my timezone


[25-May-19 07:08 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep! We can do that


[25-May-19 07:09 AM] arweave-sam#9630
We might also cycle timezones a bit at the start to try and find the best time for everyone

Hello everyone! The app that I'm building for the community Arweave Browser has it's first version https://github.com/GoldZeus/arweave-browser/releases you can see the list of apps directly from the about:blank screen

@Zeus nice one  


[25-May-19 09:48 AM] Zeus#2212
wow so nice for arweave to appear on that article  


[25-May-19 09:50 AM] Vilenarios#8742
reddit is just for shills though.  i think the days of pumping stuff on reddit left us when the 2017 bull market ended.


[25-May-19 09:50 AM] Vilenarios#8742
but - outreach to any community is important... i guess any one of us could be posting this stuff there


[25-May-19 11:06 AM] Kevin |#2500
any news for exchange? no IDEX yet?

Yeah, looks like the story might be picked up by some other outlets @rehash

Please feel free to post this stuff around Reddit if you feel the urge

Hey all, here's the agenda for the call on Monday: https://hackmd.io/c/BJs0azPpN/%2FCwrmk3oZT12Vb2_J5QLY9g

With only 30 minutes, the call is fairly brief. This call will be focused on meeting community members, setting the purpose of the call, and determining next steps. Since it is brief, we invite community members to break-out into core interest groups after the call. We look forward to talking with everyone!

Hey @JustMaier please can we add an itinerary item for discussing the standards/data definitions we have been talking about

{Reactions}
  

[25-May-19 03:31 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We need to get that system up and running ASAP, so we don't store too many transactions with non-standard data definitions, that cannot later be integrated into new apps


[25-May-19 03:54 PM] JustMaier#0425
Here's the rough idea for Arweave Serverless Functions that would validate data and act as a sort of back-end to validate data before storing it:

how do I submit a link to arweave apps?

Hey @Paste Connoisseur your app needs to be uploaded with your same wallet file you login on the site


[26-May-19 08:07 PM] Zeus#2212
and then you will have a dropdown showing your different apps, you select the right one and done  


[26-May-19 08:07 PM] Zeus#2212
if you want to do an update for a link in the future, just need to set the same name as one of your previously published app with the new link

I am wondering how hard it would be to do 'updates'


[27-May-19 02:37 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Seems it is just a case of picking the first ArQL response?


[27-May-19 02:46 PM] JustMaier#0425
It picks the last, the newest TX is always the last in the result array atm


[27-May-19 02:55 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Awesome!


[27-May-19 02:56 PM] arweave-sam#9630
So as long as it is within the same 'domain' you can redeploy and basically get something that looks like a 'file system'?

[15-Sep-17 06:04 PM] Jacwil#4297
Is there any way to support the project other than investing (already done).


[15-Sep-17 06:06 PM] jon-archain#4445
At the moment, I don't think so - besides spreading the word to anyone who you think might be interested. If there is sufficient interest we could think about merchandise, I suppose.


[15-Sep-17 06:06 PM] Jacwil#4297
No problem, can do.

Hah

A dream within a dream


[15-Sep-17 06:42 PM] arweave-sam#9630
We thought about having sub-nets for a while


[15-Sep-17 06:43 PM] arweave-sam#9630
There are a lot of reasons that would be nice


[15-Sep-17 06:43 PM] arweave-sam#9630
But it would essentially break our security model, as it stands


[15-Sep-17 06:44 PM] arweave-sam#9630
One thing you can do, though, is embed the hash of the latest block in a block in another Archain network


[15-Sep-17 06:44 PM] arweave-sam#9630
That way you make the two co-verifiable


[15-Sep-17 06:45 PM] Dandy#8330
  mhmm yes


[15-Sep-17 06:46 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Haha


[15-Sep-17 06:46 PM] arweave-sam#9630
So what is the idea with Hatnote?


[15-Sep-17 06:46 PM] arweave-sam#9630
I like the ambient sounds


[15-Sep-17 06:47 PM] arweave-sam#9630
But... how are they being generated?


[15-Sep-17 06:48 PM] mec1988#6670
I would really appreciate being able to visit a similar page relating the archain submissions via tones.


[15-Sep-17 06:48 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Interesting


[15-Sep-17 06:48 PM] mec1988#6670
Feel like they're be more meaningful.


[15-Sep-17 06:49 PM] arweave-sam#9630
If I understood what Hatnote was doing, I am sure it would be trivial to implement with the Archain ADT  


[15-Sep-17 06:49 PM] mec1988#6670
Trivial maybe to someone with skills


[15-Sep-17 06:50 PM] arweave-sam#9630
Ah


[15-Sep-17 06:50 PM] arweave-sam#9630

Hello, I remember seeing an email awhile back about converting something to AR cash. I participated in the pre-sale and still have all my wallet info. Do I need to do anything due to the AR cash change? Also, is there a wallet available?


[25-Jan-18 06:10 AM] arweave-india#5075
Hi @bettercallsaul - Nope, you don't need to do anything about the crypto token name change (it was indeed purely a name change only). In case it would be useful, here's the link to our Medium blog post where we discuss the token name change itself - https://medium.com/@archain/arc-ar-cash-f1647c3f456f. 

As for the wallet question - we actually just published a timeline covering the next few months, which includes the date of main network launch (and therefore wallet availability). Check out the timeline blog post here - https://medium.com/@archain/archain-timeline-winter-spring-2018-935a44a43318

[25-Jan-18 05:48 PM] lungov#3562
Hi everyone! With so many cases of ransom being demanded in cryptocurrencies for its anonymity, sometimes combined with the use of violence, I’ve been putting a lot of thought on what could be done to make crypto holders safer. I’m an economist and a big fan of cryptocurrencies, blockchain and now of course blockweave for what they can achieve, but unfortunately I have limited knowledge regarding the technology side of things.

I came up with something that, as far as I understand it, could be a app for the Archain, but I can’t quite be sure. So I’d like to share it with you, hopefully somebody tell me whether it can be done, if something similar exists already, help improve the idea, or maybe even somebody would like to take on and develop the app.

The basic idea is that every time one sends bitcoin or any other crypto as ransom payment, they can later mark that transfer in the blockweave as ransom payment. So there would be a record in the blockweave saying the transfer to address XX was not done voluntarily, it was done under some kind of coercion. The victim could write a message explaining what happened, maybe links to some news about it, etc.

Hopefully, the main wallet softwares (blockchain.info, Trezor, My Ehter Wallet, etc) would add a functionality to their programs that would consult such a listing every time a transfer is received, and it would tell the user that those currencies were obtained, if so, through violent means along with the message. And, of course, they would need to consult the whole history of those coins to check if the ransom payment wasn’t done way back, or else it would be too easy to launder it.


[25-Jan-18 05:49 PM] lungov#3562
Thanks to services like Ellipitic (https://www.elliptic.co/), most of the main “nodes” are known, such as localbitcoins and the main exchanges. So when the currency gets to one of those nodes, it is easy to contact it know who sent it. I’m sure they would cooperate in providing such information, as doing so would enhance overall security for all of the community. That would help the victim contact the local police and hopefully go after the person who had those coins last.

So we have a situation in which, if you receive coins that are marked as being obtained coercively, it is best you don’t accept them (and maybe even contact the police yourself). If you do accept them, you will have a hard time finding somebody who would take them as payment, and you risk being considered somebody who is helping the criminals. That is why everyone would want their wallet software to flag those coins.

If there is general acceptance, this would make the whole thing profitless and the community safer. Of course there are other details that need to be taken care of. The victim must pay a fee to mark the transaction, or else people could just flood the system with false accusations. There must be a way for the victim to unmark the transaction as a fraud once they receive the payment back, or else they themselves won’t be able to spend that money later. And so on.

But as a general sketch, what do you all think? Thanks for reading all the way down to here! Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.


[26-Jan-18 02:14 AM] arweave-india#5075
Heya @lungov !

Interesting idea - I'd like to hear what others here think for sure.

I suspect that this sort of process might run into problems with mixing services, and also with verification of a ransom or coercion situation (as the ability to mark a transfer like this as coerced is probably open to abuse in a few ways)?


[26-Jan-18 02:51 AM] lungov#3562
Thanks @arweave-india! To keep it decentralized, there would be no kind of ransom or coercion verification. So it is up to the victim to describe the situation clearly so that every one who received their coins down the line will read their description and ponder whether they should accept the payment or not. If I received a payment that came from Pavel Lerner's kidnapping, I would surely refuse it, contact authorities and tell them who sent it to me. Not just because it's the right thing to do, but also because I am not sure other people would accept those coins and I could be stuck with them.

If, on the other hand, I received a payment with a message saying something like “I bought a shirt online, it doesn’t fit well, and they don’t want to give me my money back,” I wouldn’t worry about it because that wasn’t coercion (and it is a different situation in so many different ways) and I’m sure I can easily pass that money down.

So it all comes down to how the victim will describe the situation and bring evidence to support it. I’m sure somebody who lost millions of dollars will take the time to describe the situation well. And the community will decentralizedly decide what is money that was took by force and what is just people who made bad deals – or other kind of abuse.

The fee would also act as a barrier to abusing the system. Setting the right amount and/or percentage would be a big challange in the project. It needs to be high enough to discourage abuse, and low enough to make it worthwhile paying it for a chance to get the money back.

I’m not sure I understand what you mean by mixing services. Do you mean using the Archain blockweave to store that kind of information? I may have a wrong reading on what is the kind of information we can store there.


[26-Jan-18 02:59 AM] lungov#3562
Like I said, it's just an idea I had and it is still in the egg. If people think we could discuss it and make it work, I'm happy to take it elsewhere if this is not the proper place. And of course we may come to the conclusion that it will not work as intended and nobody will want to take it forward. It happens! ; )


[26-Jan-18 04:52 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Hey @lungov -- interesting idea! I think India meant coin mixing services that make tracing the lineage of tokens difficult to trace. If you could get every mixer service to adopt the system it would work, but that might be tricky, unfortunately.

{Reactions}
  

[26-Jan-18 04:54 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Definitely neat though, and an honourable objective. Would certainly help the wider blockchain community, too.


[26-Jan-18 07:45 AM] arweave-india#5075
Definitely agree with @arweave-sam in that it's an interesting problem, and if solved would genuinely help people!

For me there is potentially a problem with authenticating the victim's account of events (I.E. someone could lie and say they were kidnapped if they regretted an expensive purchase, for example, which could be an issue with dissatisfied customers for online marketplaces) - as you say they would have to provide evidence of some sort to make verification possible. I agree that a fee for these tags makes sense, to avoid abuse of the system by people just spamming these tags, but for example, doesn't help with the 'dissatisfied customer' situation. If someone made a crypto purchase worth, say, $1000USD, and they absolutely regretted it and wanted to abuse this system, they would be willing to incur a small fee for sure if it let them get almost all of that original $1000 back.

I'll definitely have a think about this problem  - perhaps there's an obvious solution to the sort of situation I'm thinking of above?


[26-Jan-18 08:20 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Some sort of decentralised voting system for story validity?


[26-Jan-18 08:25 AM] lungov#3562
I believe that the forced transactions that we are trying to prevent are mainly two: ransomware and kidnapping for ransom. In nearly all countries, those events easily make the news. So the victim can always paste links to news that will serve reliable proof that they actually happened. Maybe also scan police reports, and stuff like that. That is how I believe the community would be able to tell apart actual victims of what we are trying to prevent from regretted shoppers.


[26-Jan-18 08:27 AM] lungov#3562
In the countries that those events sadly happen all the time, and that the police would not even provide trustworthy reports, as sad as it may be, I dont think this system would be any help.


[26-Jan-18 08:36 AM] lungov#3562
I like the discussion! Im heading to the airport where I'll have time to read about the mixing services. Ive been thinking, and I really cant think how they can help the criminals as long as all the transactions are in the blockchain. The person who sent marked tokens would need to explain how he got those tokens, and if he is one of the criminals he will have no one to point to, even if millions of transactions happened between the ransom payment and the one he was caught sending. But Ill try to understand it better.


[26-Jan-18 08:37 AM] lungov#3562
If we find solutions for these issues, there are a few more potential flaws we need to discuss. But let's see if we get past these first!


[26-Jan-18 08:55 AM] Dameon1#4928
The block does keep records,. but smarts would say to use BOT systems to transfer (1000 times over),. IE changelly, shapeshift, that doesnt verify who uses the system. DATACOIN inherently has this built in. But again exchanges dont have a KYC in place for transactions. @lungov


[26-Jan-18 08:58 AM] lungov#3562
But dont the tokens in the end return to whoever decided to do the mixing?


[26-Jan-18 09:10 AM] Dameon1#4928
Think of it like a DDoS attack,. except using exchanges to swap out. Coinbase for one doesnt actually have anything in a wallet,. They hold all coins and then "credit" your account,. So after a million exchanges (which seems impossible for humans but bots can do it seeemlessly) it gets thrown into a pool. The cross block algorithm you would need to follow every transaction from transfer (ransom) to possession(crime) is nearly impossible. If it was one or two you could track down the "who" withdrew where, but after so many transfers and the "cryptographic" nature. Heres a good link that discusses further.

Thank you for the link and for all explanation, @Dameon1 ! Ill certainly have a look and hopefully understand this better.


[26-Jan-18 10:24 AM] lungov#3562
I just read about the mixing services. Im not sure how an app like the one I described would affect and be affected by such services. Of course there is a lot of stolen tokens being mixed, so one would certainly get some of these tokens back. So the big question is, if somebody tries to spend marked tokens and is reported, and then they tell the authorities that they received those tokens from a mixing service, but that they committed no kind of crime. They just wanted their privacy. Would they be charged?

It surely depends on the country. But it is difficult to foresee the outcome of an app like that given how mixing services operate.


[26-Jan-18 10:30 AM] lungov#3562
Given that every one would receive marked money back, mixing would become increasingly pointless I think. So I guess the app would turn out to be a heavy blow on those services.


[26-Jan-18 10:31 AM] Dameon1#4928
Whats wrong with that?


[26-Jan-18 10:32 AM] Dameon1#4928
KYC/AML is OK in my book,.


[26-Jan-18 10:38 AM] lungov#3562
What's wrong with hitting on mixing services? Im not saying there is anything wrong, Im just trying to assess how useful such an app would be to prevent ransom attacks. There would be a clash between the app and such services for sure, I cant tell which one would prevail.


[26-Jan-18 10:39 AM] lungov#3562
I guess it depends on how legal systems worldwide see non criminal mixers.


[26-Jan-18 10:39 AM] Dameon1#4928
It's being discussed.. IMF is looking into all of this.


[26-Jan-18 10:46 AM] lungov#3562
Because the app would help authorities find mixers, criminals or not. And the mix services would help criminal mixers disguise as non criminals. So if governments perceive non criminal mixers as criminals, people would stop mixing and using cryptos to demand ransom. If they do not, the app will be useless. So it all depends on that, in my opinion.

Indeed, Erik has been here for a while. I haven't had time to check it out yet, but will have a look later.

Are you going to Code BEAM SF @enilsen16 ? I have a few free tickets if you (or anyone else) are interested.


[09-Mar-18 01:57 AM] enilsen16#0335
I am. See you there!

How's this time change working for you? It's almost 9AM. Silicon Valley is moving huh? Dev central over there. Take a look at housing prices if you get a chance. Almost 1 mil a home. @arweave-sam ,btw your handle on here is A-weave not arweave..


[16-Mar-18 11:01 AM] arweave-sam#9630
So it is! Thanks for pointing that out.

The time change hasn't been too bad actually. SF is bustling as ever! It is amazing how quiet Berlin is by comparison.

[02-Jun-18 04:25 AM] DrEd23 (3,3)#4993
Idk I’m guess they saw USA, even though I’m an accredited investor. And really love the project.


[02-Jun-18 04:29 AM] Shugah Valentine#3278
Wow! Accredited and still  rejected? That's a hard pill to swallow. I'm in the US to but not accredited though. I love the project as well that is the only reason I'm in the chat. Would love to see how it grows in the coming months.

Hey guys - sorry to hear you're having issues with KYC! 

Feel free to drop us an email. My colleague Kyle is the one managing most KYC technical hitches, his email is: kyle@arweave.org


[02-Jun-18 01:28 PM] arweave-india#5075
@DeanRey Hi there - please drop us an email we'd love to help.  My colleague Kyle would be the one to contact: kyle@arweave.org


[02-Jun-18 03:32 PM] DeanRey#5479
@arweave-india Thanks will do


[02-Jun-18 04:15 PM] DeanRey#5479
@arweave-india Good luck with the ICO but i don't think i'll be able to take part as tried several time to submit KYC without success. Keeps sending me up to the selfie section  


[02-Jun-18 07:06 PM] arweave-india#5075
@DeanRey Let us help you out, don't worry   Do you want to PM me here so we can chat about the details of your submission? Thanks!


[02-Jun-18 08:13 PM] Roman#2713
Hi, @arweave-india ! 
Not sure this is the right place for this question.
Why did you decide to set such a high personal cap for the second round (6th of June)? 
With a limit of 50 ETH, only 1-2 people will be able to participate in it at best .
I believe it's in the interests of the project that as many community members as possible could get into the second round. And for this, the best solution is to cut a personal cap to 1 ETH may be less. In this there is no any risk for ico. Anyway, you will sold out with in seconds.
But in this case, happy participants can be 50 times more.
And don't forget to set the Gwei limit.
What do you think about it?

Thank you for your kindness!


[02-Jun-18 08:14 PM] arweave-india#5075
Oh Roman don't worry I think there is some confusion here  


[02-Jun-18 08:15 PM] arweave-india#5075
The range of allocations offered in the upcoming sale is 0.2 ETH to 2 ETH only, because we wanted to include as many people as possible, not just sell to a few people as you say. Those allocation offers are completely protected (from being bought by other people) for 72 hours.


[02-Jun-18 08:15 PM] arweave-india#5075
Basically, we entirely agree with you and we structured the sale in a way to reflect this  


[02-Jun-18 08:32 PM] Roman#2713
I understand that most likely all will be sold out in the first 72 hours.
But you can believe me that everyone who got into Whitelist hopes that the Second round will be and he will certainly try to participate in it
If the Second round will happen, then better to set fair conditions for him too.


[02-Jun-18 08:33 PM] arweave-india#5075
I understand - we're releasing full information about what will happen in that 24 hours to everyone who received an allocation (e.g. will there be gas limits, etc.)


[02-Jun-18 08:33 PM] arweave-india#5075
And it will only be open to people who have passed KYC and already offered an allocation in that sale, just to confirm


[02-Jun-18 08:35 PM] Roman#2713
Ok, thanks and good luck!


[02-Jun-18 08:35 PM] arweave-india#5075
Thank you!


[03-Jun-18 06:08 AM] DeanRey#5479
@arweave-india Thanks all sorted. The form didn't like my ID photo so i retook and all good now. Hope i'm not too late.


[03-Jun-18 06:40 AM] juliosaa#2706
How many AR tokens will be issue in total ?


[04-Jun-18 10:47 AM] arweave-india#5075
@DeanRey Excellent - if you need to resubmit for some reason we'll contact you   But you'll get an outcome either way via email from team@arweave.org


[04-Jun-18 10:47 AM] arweave-india#5075
@juliosaa 66 million tokens overall, that's 55 mil in the genesis block and 11 mil for mining rewards across all time


[04-Jun-18 06:09 PM] juliosaa#2706
Thanks.. i just resubmit my KYC  form. Once is approve you will transfer the tokens and if im not mistaking these tokens are not erc20, will you provide also a wallet?


[04-Jun-18 06:13 PM] juliosaa#2706
Oh and btw i invested in Archain back in 2017


[05-Jun-18 10:03 AM] arweave-india#5075
@juliosaa Okay that's great - feel free to drop me an email if you have KYC support needs (india@arweave.org). Yes, we will be providing a multi-token wallet at launch, plus our own Arweave wallet (you can choose) - this info will be distributed to all token holders for mainnet launch on the 8th


[05-Jun-18 10:05 AM] Roman#2713
Hi  @arweave-india !
Have you already decided on the conditions for the second round?
Need any help in order to determine the optimal size of a personal cap?


[05-Jun-18 10:06 AM] arweave-india#5075
@Roman Hi! This info will be emailed out to all eligible participants before the second round commences (gas/gwei limit, personal cap, etc.)


[05-Jun-18 10:11 AM] Roman#2713
Yes thank you! I saw already the same message in Telegrams
I thought maybe you are interested in the community's opinion on this matter:)


[05-Jun-18 10:15 AM] arweave-india#5075
Sure, happy for you to PM me if you like   Telegram is a bit quicker for me at the moment


[05-Jun-18 10:30 AM] Roman#2713
@arweave-india I think it makes no sense to start a correspondence in a new place.
This is a very quick question.
The optimal personal cap should be such that at least 20% of the participants in the first round would be able to participate.
This is Pareto principle.
I hope you should also like the scientific approach in this matter  


[07-Jul-18 12:03 PM] codybartfast#9308
In 24 hrs I've heard about two projects that (to my ingnorant mind) aim to address similar needs as Arweave, a blockchain based solution for public digital archives (Archangel: http://blockchain.surrey.ac.uk/projects/archangel.html) and Microsoft's new immutable storage (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-immutable-blob-storage-now-in-public-preview/).

Ceratainly seems Arweave is on-trend!

There is this youtube influencer ivanontech, some of you probably have heard of him, he keeps talking about functional programming being safer than imperative prog, maybe you guys should approach him to review Arweave? it would get a lot of attention. He recently spoke about Erlang, he was not aware of blockchain projects built upon it.

We would like to at some point @breeze , but there are other development priorities right now


[27-May-19 03:12 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Which hardware wallet would you prefer, out of interest?


[27-May-19 03:13 AM] breeze#9762
Cool, understood Sam! Either Trezor or Ledger, either would be great


[27-May-19 03:13 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Got it


[27-May-19 03:14 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Yep, I am interested to see which of Ledger or Trezor wins the hardware wallet race


[27-May-19 03:14 AM] arweave-sam#9630
Seems Ledger has more aggressive marketing at the moment


[27-May-19 03:42 AM] shiggidy#4554
ledger has better response times with alts for integration, and alts can do a lot of the legwork themselves


[27-May-19 03:42 AM] shiggidy#4554
although raven has been waiting for about 6 months for ledger to "accept" and finalize integration


[27-May-19 03:43 AM] shiggidy#4554
and raven is a direct fork of btc


[27-May-19 03:43 AM] shiggidy#4554
so you're held up by their timeline


[27-May-19 03:43 AM] shiggidy#4554
trezor on the other hand, their integration time is completely up to them


[27-May-19 03:43 AM] shiggidy#4554
and when they want to do it


[27-May-19 03:44 AM] shiggidy#4554
i have both yet the community in raven has done more developing for ledger than trezor at this point mostly bc of the ease of developer resources

Hi all!

As we head towards the holidays we wanted to let you know that the Archain team will soon be on leave for the festive period, meaning that we'll be less active on Discord, and we'll take a little longer than usual to answer messages and emails. We'll be back in the office as usual again from the 4th of January, and look forward to speaking with you all then!

Thank you all for contributing so much to the Archain community and being so active here on Discord – this has been a great platform for us to hear different thoughts and perspectives on both the wider goals of the project and intricate technicalities of the software. 

We hope that you all have a happy holiday season, and a positive and productive new year too! 

All the best

From today onwards, Archain will be known as Arweave. This will further differentiate us from similarly named cryptocurrency projects, while putting the focus on our novel and innovative blockweave technology. Rest assured that we remain totally committed to our mission of building a universal platform for information permanence, and there is no change or impact on the tokens held by our backers. Same team, same vision, same technology – just a new name.

You can read more about the name change on our Medium blog post here: https://medium.com/@arweave/archain-now-known-as-arweave-432f0708eed0 , and check out our brand new website at www.arweave.org. 

If you have any questions, comments, or feedback feel free to share them here on Discord, or email us directly at our new team email address (team@arweave.org).

Thanks as always for your time and support everyone!

Hello all!

We have just sent out an important email to all presale backers from the 2017 token sale (back when we were called Archain). Please keep an eye on your email inbox and your junk/spam folders for this message.

As many of you already know, as of the 8th of June, the Arweave mainnet is up and running!


[26-Jun-18 09:16 AM] arweave-india#5075
   Arweave tokens are now transferable, meaning they can be sent to and from wallets on the Arweave network.    

The Arweave web extension has also now been published, and offers the dual functionality of a basic native Arweave wallet, and the ability to use your AR tokens to archive webpages. This signifies the completion of our very first use case on the Arweave mainnet - permanently archiving web pages! 

Here is the link to download the Arweave extension from the Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/arweave-client/iplppiggblloelhoglpmkmbinggcaaoc?hl=en-US. Once you have installed the extension, right-click on the icon and select ‘Options’ to get started.

Please note that for  the Upvest wallet, users may need to clear their cache and cookies in order to see the ‘send’ button.  You can continue to use the Upvest wallet if you choose.

The Arweave wallet can also be used as a cold wallet. If you would like these instructions please email the team at team@arweave.org requesting these instructions.

[26-Jun-18 09:18 AM] arweave-india#5075
Instructions for creating your Arweave wallet:

1. Install the Arweave web extension from the Google Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/arweave-client/iplppiggblloelhoglpmkmbinggcaaoc?hl=en-US 

2. Right-click the extension icon (the Arweave logo) on your browser and go to ‘Options’, this brings up the Arweave wallet interface

3. Go to ‘Wallet Options’ in the bottom left and select ‘Generate Wallet’

4. Download the key file, storing it somewhere you will remember, and naming it something memorable

5. Go to ‘Wallet Options’ again, click ‘Load Wallet’

6. Drag and drop the key file into the box provided

7. Set a password for your wallet (optional but recommended) - please type this very carefully. You are responsible for remembering your password and recording it accurately, Arweave cannot recover your wallet if you lose your password.

[27-Jun-18 01:22 PM] arweave-india#5075
Remember:

- Arweave tokens are not ERC-20 tokens, so cannot be used with Ethereum network wallets. AR tokens are native tokens to the Arweave network.

- If you send tokens to an address that does not exist on the Arweave network, you will not be able to recover your tokens. So, do not ever send your AR tokens to an Ethereum wallet address.

- We strongly recommend performing a test transaction with a small quantity of AR tokens, especially when sending to a new address or when using the Arweave or Upvest wallets for the first time.

Hi all,

Here is a mini-update of what we have been up to:

- Arweave version 1.5 is nearing release. This version builds considerably on the initial main network release, changing approximately 20% of the codebase and delivering faster data access and a more reliable mining experience. This has been the focus on our dev team’s work for a while now, so we’re really excited to get this shipped soon. 

- The second version of the Arweave web extension, with significantly improved user experience (thanks to your community feedback!) is also nearer release. Among the user interface changes, this update will also add features like multiple wallet support.

- Progress continues on the ArchiveIt! permanent file backup system, improving its user interface and general ease of use.

- Exciting work continues bringing new businesses and customers to the network — we will release names at an appropriate moment  .

- We have hired 3 new members of staff, and are in the process of filling three further positions.

- Less exciting, but still necessary operations update: we now have a new office that will be able to accommodate our growing team!

Regarding exchanges: I am sure that you all understand the situation by now - we are in high level talks with a number of exchanges, and we are continuing to make progress, though we cannot discuss any further details publicly at this stage. We would love to tell you all about our progress, but doing so would put that progress itself in jeopardy. We thank you sincerely for your understanding.

Today we're happy to announce the release of 1.6.1.0 of the Arweave Node. This includes a lot of changes since the last release 1.6.1.0 in late November. Here is the digest:

* Rewrite/remake of the custom port feature. When all nodes have upgraded, you will be able to run the miner on other ports than 1984.
* Less verbose output when starting `arweave-server`.
* Added transaction status endpoint (/tx/[transaction_id]/status). See http_iface_docs.md
* Added endpoint for listing all transactions for an wallet (/wallet/[wallet_address]/txs/[earliest_tx]). See http_iface_docs.md
* Let the node create wallets and sign transactions for you. See http_post_unsigned_tx_docs.md
* Mixed improvements to make the node run more reliably.
* Faster block propagation.

Upgrade instructions:
1. Shut down arweave-server.
2. `git fetch --all --tags && git checkout master && git reset --hard N.1.6.1.0`
3. Start arweave-server again with the same arguments as before.

If you're looking for peers to start arweave-server with, you are welcome to use the recently updated peer list found in the mining guide. These peers are all operated by the Arweave organization. https://docs.arweave.org/info/mining/mining-guide

@here Today we are happy to announce the release 1.6.2.0 of the Arweave Node!

We have
- Significantly increased the efficiency of block and transaction propagation.
- Sped up the fork recovery process.
- Added a `GET /wallet/[Addr]/deposits` endpoint for fetching incoming transfers for a wallet. For more details, see https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/blob/N.1.6.2.0/http_iface_docs.md.
- Fixed a bug in the `POST /unsigned_tx` endpoint where it required irrelevant data. The updated endpoint documentation is at https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/blob/N.1.6.2.0/http_post_unsigned_tx_docs.md.
- Made various reliability improvements.

Upgrade instructions:

1. Shut down `arweave-server`.
2. `git fetch --all --tags && git checkout master && git reset --hard N.1.6.2.0`
3. Start `arweave-server` again with the same arguments as before.

For more details on how to run the node, please see our mining guide -
https://docs.arweave.org/info/mining/mining-guide.

Pay attention to the recommended list of peers. It has not been updated since the last release. These peers are all operated by the Arweave organization.

And a little bonus for those willing to contribute - we have prepared a simple guide for external contributors - https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md, check it out!

@here Today we are happy to announce the release 1.6.3 of the Arweave Node!

In it:

1. The `block/hash/[hash]` and `block/height/[height]` HTTP endpoints do not return a hash list by default anymore. Viewing blocks in a browser/other HTTP client is now much faster!
2. Reliability improvements of the time measurement for difficulty adjustments.
3. Various reliability improvements for the mining worker processes.
4. New mining benchmark tool, using real candidate block production to measure mining performance much more accurately. You can run it with `./arweave-server benchmark`.Note: As the new benchmarking tool tests real block production speed, not just pure hashing power, it may appear that the effective hashing rate has decreased. This is false. As it happens, the changes mentioned in point 3 lead to improved mining performance.

Upgrade instructions:

1. Shut down arweave-server. To make sure the shutdown was successful, run `ps aux | grep beam`. The output should only have a single line with `grep beam` at the end.
2. git fetch --all --tags && git checkout master && git reset --hard N.1.6.3.1
3. Start arweave-server again with the same arguments as before.

For more details on how to run the node, please see our mining guide -                                                 
https://docs.arweave.org/info/mining/mining-guide.

Pay attention to the recommended list of peers. It has not been updated since the last release. These peers are all operated by the Arweave organization, so use them if you trust them - alternatively join on the IP address of another trusted node.


[04-Apr-19 09:28 AM] arweave-lev#3466
If any of you has already updated to N.1.6.3.0, consider updating to N.1.6.3.1. It contains a fix for the bug when startup would fail if one of the trusted peers is unavailable (thanks @Vilenarios for reporting the issue!). I've also updated the release announcement above to mention N.16.3.1. Under "/info" you should see `"release:" 23`.
