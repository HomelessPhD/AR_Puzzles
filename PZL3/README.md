# Arweave Puzzle #3 - "...You'd be surprised how easy #3 is..."

Here i am going to publish ideas i consider about and dummy instruments related to Arweave puzzle #3.

This puzzle is one from the series of Arweave Puzzles made by @Tiamat (official Arweave project discord member, apps developer, miner, early investor). Originally, puzzle posted in official @Tiamat twitter [[1]](https://twitter.com/ArweaveP/status/1132936723162378240): with hints and link to the blockchain [[2]](https://kszeqgxezf5quhzld4nhpasyilhxphclq2peqi5mrn7utxmqhwga.arweave.net/VLJIGuTJewofKx8ad4JYQs93nEuGnkgjrIt_Sd2QPYw
)

Puzzle consists of the HTML page (sources also attached in this git - but could be found on Arweave "blockchain") page with an AES encrypted message (the Arweave wallet with **1000 AR** coins on it, that is around of **41 k$** right now). The decryption mechanism is already built in page so the solver should only type the correct 4-symbols "words" (4-symbol combinations) to the 8 placeholders as show on picture below. The key to the puzzle solving is an image with 8 separated pictures:

# The official hints given by the puzzle creator are listed below:


    
```
    From Twitter:
    
1] Did anybody count the dots?

2] With N.1.7.0.0 release, third pic became obsolete ðŸ˜‰
```    

	
```
	From discord:
3] You'd be surprised how easy #3 is

4] It is not hard actually, someone which followed the project during last six months 
should solve 7 images easily and for 1 some luck needed 

5] It's not my fault that people see a tree with - - - -  and they actually type TREE and
expect to unlock.

6] (Some dev about other dev guessing the answer for pic 4) Haha interesting, when we first 
looked at it, I think @arweave-india got number 4 ðŸ˜† -> (PZL creator) I'm 99% she was thinking 
about the right answer, which  by the way, in the sketch was different, but this one was so 
obvious, I just adjusted to it:)  -> (that other dev that guessing) Hehe, I think I might be 
in the right area now for a few more of the clues for puzzle 3 ðŸ¤” Good job though, I am 
impressed at how tricky it is! -> (pzl creator) exactly, once you get on the right track, 
one by one they seem much easier
```

Some ideas came to my mind, others were captured from Twitter or\and the telegram group [[3]](@arweavep) - you definitely should visit it for ideas sharing.
(at first few months i have forcefully avoided visiting any forums or groups when i saw the puzzle at first because i thought that ideas of others could freeze my own thinking process - it is when you start to think primarly in the way proposed by some other solver and, got stuck on it, but later trying my own ideas with my own dummy brute forcing method i skipped that rule. I am actively posting any ideas came to my mind in that group, hoping someone of us will be able to solve the puzzle sharing some part of revenue and GLORY)

There are pretty "classic" ideas of what each image could code, but also there apretty exotic ideas. The last will be discussed at the end of this paper. Lets consider each picture one by one at first:

## 1-st key
![1-st key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL3/pics/1.png )

Thats pretty hard one. One may assume that it images 4 letters: "A", "N", "N" or "H", "D" or "O". That forms 4-symbol "word" just as requested: ANNO, ANHO, ANWO,... BUT, i doubt one of theese letter combinations is the answer. 
ANNO could be interpreted as "since" meaning the year (like the "ANNO 1901" that could be found on top of some European buildings that means that it was constructed in year 1901, and that was the first i thought it should be - the year of Arweave birthday or ICO or any other related date - may be even DD/MM combination).
ANHO could be assumed to denote the investor who supported the Arweave project by a descent investment - "ANdreessen HOrowitz" or "a16z" that is a logo of his company and so it could be the key.
More trivial answers here would be 4-letter words somehow related to Arweave or the image.

Finally, i consider the next keys: `2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, anno, year, a16z, ANHO, hack, logo, tags, apps, dapp, text, icon, name, page, anon, html, link, http, main, mail, type, json, file, luck, free, drop, UNCE, curl, data, from, ....`

## 2-nd key
![2-nd key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL3/pics/2.png )

This a tricky piece. 

The first thing the solvers usually do here is googling this number "21863" that results in coordinates: 21863 is ZIP code (index) of Snow Hill, MD in USA [[4]](https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/21863/). That instantly gives: "snow", "hill", "city", "town", "code", "mail" keys. Recalling the fact that the picture contains this number in romb with arrows - someone could go further and see that roads around the city forms the romb AND the road MD12 goes through the city (through the romb) exactly or very likely as drawn on the picture by two arrows. So another option here is "md12", "road", "path". Going even further with thi idea - i have found that there is a mine not far by the md12 road [[5]](https://thediggings.com/places/md0472391417/map) - somewhere close to the bolder arrow on the picture.

![Snow HIll MD12 - ZIP 21863](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL3/pics/MD12.png)

Another interesting idea about this picture - "21863" missing the "0". In other words - it is a date: 2018\06\03 that could be interpreted as Arweave ICO date for example, that also give "date", "2018", "fund", "zero", "null", "0.73" (the price at ico) keys. Here the missed "0" could also point to the 0 block (ZERO block - the initial block in AR chain).

P.S. There is Snow Hill streat (?) very close to the ARweave HeadQuarters in London - so it could point us to this location or the SnowHill itself ("head", "main", "home" or maybe "sh" for "bash" etc.)

Finally, i'd consider the next keys here: `md12, mine, mail, path, road, main, link, text, code, hash, fund, date, towm city, hill, snow, data, mark, luck, sale, bash, head, main, zero, null, year, 2018, 0.73, 5etg, romb ...`

Someone could also look for the block number 21863 - but there is nothing interesting about it. (sure, many complex manipulations could be done with block data - but that is a dead end).

## 3-rd key
![3-rd key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL3/pics/3.png )

This picture was directly hinted by the @Tiamat. "With N.1.7.0.0 release, third pic became obsolete". It is very likely related to Arweave sources [[6']](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/releases), especially N.1.7.0.0 release [[6]](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/releases/tag/N.1.7.0.0). The most interesting part of this release comments (readme) are the following:

```
We're very happy to announce the N.1.7.0.0 release of the Arweave node!
...
New features
   1. RandomX proof-of-work algorithm
   
      RandomX is a PoW algorithm that is optimized for general-purpose
      CPUs. RandomX uses random code execution together with several
      memory-hard techniques to maximize the efficiency of
      general-purpose CPUs and therefore make GPU accelerated miners
      and ASIC based miners less likely to be advantageous.
      ....
      The mining benchmark is updated with a new argument for choosing
      RandomX hashing or the previous SHA-384 hashing. E.g.
      `./arweave-server benchmark randomx max_miners 4`. A bug was
      also fixed which halved all the performance numbers.
      ...

   2. Two-way integration with IPFS
   
      Arweave is launching an IPFS incentivisation layer, providing
      permanent storage for the IPFS network. Read more about it here:
      ...

   5. Config file
      All startup arguments can be put in a JSON based config file and
      be loaded with the new startup argument `config_file`.
      ...

Reliability and operations improvements
   1. Cowboy
      The HTTP server Elli is replaced with Cowboy.
...
```

Recalling that picture likely to image the mining process and contains two letters "SH", the next ideas instantly come to mind:
"ASIC" (the mining algorithm has been changed from sha384 to RandomX that should have helped ordinary miners in their battle with ASICS), "a384" or "-384"  that stands form SHA 384 that is an old mining algorithm the was replaced by RandomX in this release. Also, HTTP server Ellis were replaced with Cowboy. And some IPFS arrangements as well.
 
Finally, i'd consider the next keys here: `ASIC, a384, -384, a256, -256, hash, mine, farm, earn, gpus, Elli, IPFS, luck, algo, ...`

## 4-th key
![4-th key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL3/pics/4.png )

This pic was mentioned in a small talk in discord between @Tiamat and one of the developers. That talk is not very helpful (given above).
Anyway, the first thing came to mind is AR transaction or AR coin transaction or swap procedure or selling or just pointing to the price or cost. Also, should be noted that transaction in AR bring\store the data.

Some could propose LOKI or SILO here (arweave product) [[7]](https://arweave.medium.com/building-silo-a-truly-private-internet-556c860222ca) - just look at picture in article

![LOKI - SILO](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL3/pics/LOKI_SILO.png)

Finally, i'd consider the next keys here: `artx, LOKI, SILO, coin, cash, icon, logo, arex, data, cost, rate, AR/$, swap, sell, list, view, arql, luck, fees, when, send, sent, 0.73 ...`

## 5-th key
![5-th key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL3/pics/5.png )

One may notice here the map of SCANdinavia or more like Denmark, Norway, Sweden (DNS). And first things could be reasoned here: it is SCAN or PORT that is used in Arweave node that is 1984. Some others propose here LOKI from Scandinavian mythology that is also a name of " a decentralised network" that collaborated with Arweave in "the creation of SILO" (one of arweave product) [[7]](https://arweave.medium.com/building-silo-a-truly-private-internet-556c860222ca).

The programing language ERLang came from Sweden (? that fact was mentioned by the AR developer in discord). Sweden is the part of Scandinavian countries - one of those drawn on the pic5. So erlang or .erl could be the answer to pic5.

Finally, i'd consider the next keys here: `scan, port, 1984, silo, loki, nord, " dns", luck, free, lang, .erl, from, ...`

## 6-th key
![6-th key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL3/pics/6.png )

Thats the tree. Interesting fact - it seems to have 4 roots, 4 branches, 32 leafs. @Tiamat mentioned this: " It's not my fault that people see a tree with - - - -  and they actually type TREE and expect to unlock.".

Well, not gonna judge his statement, but he said #3 should be very easy, so the option TREE was on my list before i've found that discord statement made by him. Tree could symbolize the graph or tree-like data structure. So it could be data, root, node or their alliases like "beam" (the is the name of the node program or daemon - correct me if i wrong). Also it could be Arweave-Sparse Merkle Tree (ASMT). Look this page stored in arweave for example [[8]](https://5ykygzjsftdm7ri7dutxuj45jiabjs7mvidaw5gaqbvcwkwm7wlq.arweave.net/7hWDZTIsxs_FHx0neiedSgAUy-yqBgt0wIBqKyrM_Zc
).

Tree have 32 leafs ( 9 leafs, 7 leafs, 8 leafs, 8 leafs) - that is approximately the number of coins emitted by miner on each block in 01-2019 - 06-2019 so pic 6 could be 32AR or some else reward synonimous. 

Finally, i'd consider the next keys here: `tree, hash, root, leaf, date, data, ASMT, node, byte, data, beam, luck, SILO, 32AR, 9788, list, peer, size, ...`

## 7-th key
![7-th key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL3/pics/7.png )

Many solvers got stuck on this picture, but i clearly see the easy answer here: it are letters U, p, L, L, that could form PULL (that can also be represented by its sound like pool).

Some think that it could be a point to UpVest that invested in arweave some funds [[9]](https://support.upvest.co/support/solutions/folders/47000738293)

Finally, i'd consider the next keys here: `pull,  pool, vest, west, node, fork, luck,...`

## 8-th key
![8-th key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL3/pics/8.png )

The last one is tricky, but seems to be mentioned by @Tiamat in his official twitter hints: " Did anybody count the dots?". Considering he pointed the picture 8 only and all black object on it, it results in 58 "dots". The base58 encoding is a typical in cryptosphere, so BASE could be mean here.

Finally, i'd consider the next keys here: `base, data, apps, dapp, star, cost, code, luck, dots, peer ...`


# "Exotic" ideas
0)   I assume each picture could contain at least two parts: the one that determine some complex term or concept 
   (process of block mining pictured on 3rd picture - the algorithm before N 1.7.0.0 was SHA384) and the second
   part slice or shape this term or concept into 4-letter result (SH)A384 - "SH" already pictured on the image 
   leaving 4-letter result "A384.
   
   Moving this way, i could propose the next simple ideas for all 8 keys that still seems not strong enough to be
   assumed as final solution but could point us in the right direction:
   ```
   [1] It is the first picture in puzzle and so i could assume its order could mean something - most ppl would get know
   about the ARWEAVE at its announcement and so its "(ANNO)UNCE". It pictures the 4 letters "ANNO" leaving "UNCE"
   for solution. (its pretty weak i should say)  
       Another idea that is actually pretty close to previous - it is the first picture meaning the START of the
   project. And it has 4 letters "ANNO" that mean "SINCE" meaning in some languages (in Europe one could meat the
   string on the building "ANNO 1902" meaning that building was build in 1902 and currently stay since that year). 
   So i could assume here the "(SINCE )2014", "(SINCE )2015",..., "(SINCE )2018" or "(SINCE )2019" with slicing
   it to the year only 4-digit answer. (this looks better than previous option, but still weak)
       
   [2] The second picture could show the sale date 2018\06\03 that forms the concept for answer AND showing the BLOCK
   as shaping hint. Some token sale site giving this string on googling the sale: "Important: 1.1% of genesis block
   supply (55 mln tokens) is available in the public sale, for which there is a hardcap of $400k USD."
   And "1.1%( of genesis block)" could be the answer here. As well, as "(token)sale"
   The crazy option about "SNOW HILL" (as concept) + THE ROAD (the hint) that leads to "MD12" answer also fits the
   general idea, but weakly.
       
   [3] The third picture, as it was mentioned, shows the mining process (the concept for the answer) - before N 1.7.0.0
   the SHA384 algorithm for minining were used. AND answer-shaping hint "SH" (two letter pictured on the image) shape
   the answer to "(SH)A384".
   
   [4] The fourth picture (the lower its part) could image the "AR CASH" concept (the native token of the network that
   is actually were called as AR.CASH".  While the ARWEAVE LOGO on the upper part of the picture could shape the answer
   slicing it to 4-letter: "(AR.)CASH" 
   
   [5] The fifth picture is a MAP of THREE COUNTRIES: Denmark Norway Sweden (DNS).
   Its pretty weak and generally hard to - workaround using the proposed concept-hint rule, but the answer here could be
   "(DNS)PORT" or "(DNS)1984" or "(PORT)1984" or "(MAP)SCAN". Propose your options in terms of concept-hint idea guys.
   
   [6] The sixth picture shows the TREE that have 4 roots, 4 branches and 32 leafs. I could assume that MERKLE TREE
   pictured here, that is the concept. And TREE is a answer-shaping hint here. The MERKLE tree is actually a HASH tree
   so i could assume "HASH(TREE)" solution.
   
   [7] This picture could be interpreted as "UP" and "CACTUS". Weak idea here to think it pointing to the UPVEST investor.
   The letters Up shaped on the picture as some weird cactus (needles around letters) and one could assume "WEST" here that
   very close to VEST - thats why UPVEST seemed to be a concept here. The hint - those two letters "UP" that shape the answer
   to "(UP)VEST"
   
   [8] Here, again, a weak solution - there are 58 circular objects on the picture that will be assumed as a hint. The concept
   part could be taken from the fact that it is the final picture. Some crypto operations end with BASE58 encodings. BASE58
   could be the concept while "58" is a answer-shaping hint.  The solution - "BASE(58)"
   
   ```

1) I suppose, all the puzzle could be related to Arweave project [[10]](https://arweave.news/what-is-arweave-ar/),[[10']](https://arwiki.wiki/#/en/main) or even more convrete - the mining. Fresh article about Arweave mining could be found here [[10'']](https://arwiki.wiki/#/en/arweave-mining)

  I have read most of Discord messages for the period mentioned in Tiamat hint (1 January of 2019 - 31 May of 2019). I have found few facts:
  ```
   - Just a lil time has passed since the mining begun to actually reward miners with BLOCK rewards. Some ppl mentioned that
     the block rewards was 7 coins per block, and later was changed to 32-33 coins per block. The given time interval related
     to the most profitable time to mine AR. The block rewards is at peak value above its short history, the size of the blockchain
     (weavechain) is reasonably small (30-60 GBs), not many miners participate. Some ppl stated they mined coins with approximate
     cost around 0.02$ per coin assuming their spendings (on renting VPS or paying for electricity + equipment)

   -   Some investors complained about such mining "profitability" \ rewarding cause the ICO investors payed around 0.73$ per AR coin.
     Some of them asking for possible compensation but the team and community is against it. Soon the block reward will start to
     decrease and the difficulty of mining would increase due to new miners anyway.

   -   People in discords and else places complained about the fact, that there is no place to buy or sell AR coins. The only official
     possible way  to buy or sell coins is OTC through "Base58" that has a minimal purchase threshold (10 000$). Other way to buy or
     sell tokens some risky OTC trades outside of discord.

   -   Many people ask and demand on creating the INDEXER for the content that was uploaded to Arweave Blockchain cause its mostly
     impossible to search some interesting data on the AR. The developers of AR aggrees, saying they be very thankfull for such an
     instrument or service (it could be a service on a dedicated server etc.) calling it ARoogle. 
     Few enthusiastic users - developers of applications for AR aplying their forces to build some helpfull apps. <will add here the
     link to helpfull app>  Also, some functionality of this kind is given by ARQL (available in those days too)

   -   One memeber created pretty simple and yet very usefull and important app - the ArweaveID. This app links the wallet address
    with a label (name) to be used in other apps.  For example, send ARmails using this ID etc...

   -   Just like now, there were a possibility to get a free coins for experiments: 5 AR. Developers stated they had taken contermeasures
    againgst abusers of this "faucet" or "drop".

   -   Also, some users mentioned UpVest asking the developers about some problems in managing their ICO tokens (withdrawing) from
    UpVest - seems like there were just a few problems and they have been solved, but UpVest hav been mentioned.

   -   Some miners worrying that the data uploaded to Arweave blockchain - the data the miner should store to actually get rewards, could
    contain illegal information. Developers stated that they are working on that problem. One of possible and already implemented on
    that time solution is to filter the stored data (by key words or hash).

   -   There were mentions of SILO that is a promising AR project made in colloboration with LOKI. Seems like the AR team has made their
    part of the work (at least first versions) on this time interval and waited for LOKI to do their part of the work.
  ```
  
  So i guessed here for ideas, that the solution related to: mining process, the way to get coins, the companies involved in ar life etc.
  For example:
  ```
  UpVest and Base58 mentioned in discord and related to the only official way to buy coins could suit the 7th and 8th keys respectively.
  
  LOKI and SILO mentioned in discord and articles of that time could suite the 5th and 6th keys ( the tree has 32 leafs - some valuable step in SILO
  provide a hashing with 32 bytes result that is mentioned on advertising materials) - a weak relation, but possible.
  
  mine (hash), swap\sell\sale\sent\send(rate,cost) could suite the 3rd and 4th keys with respect to what was discussed in discord in that time interval and the main idea considered in this specific "crazy idea"
  
  luck(free,drop), sale\sold\sent(luck) could assumed for the 1th and 2nd keys with respect to this "crazy idea"
  ```

2) I have posted in twitter [[11]](https://twitter.com/miningpredict) an exotic idea - all 8 "keys" should form one sentence. Moreover, some words or symbols typed in __ __ __ __ placeholders could decay to pieces forming several words with its neighbors. Just look at an example below:

![idea?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL3/pics/idea.png)

3) Some telegram member assumed, that each picture could somehow be related to symbols on the PC keyboard: `1 - "!", 2 - "@", 3 - "#", 4 - "$", 5 - "%", 6 - "^", 7 - "&", 8 - "*"`
Should say, that this idea seems very funny and same time interesting. `"!"` - could be related to company anouncement (may be year or date),  `"@"` could be related to emails or just mail, `"#"` is for hashing, `"$"` - even presented on the picture itself and could be related to cash or cost or sell and swap or rate ..., `"%"` - rate (no great ideas here, maybe its from controlling symbols), `"^"` - top of the tree or fork or root etc., `"&"` - could be related to pools where miner & miner & miner ... do the work (lol), `"*"` - points even drawn on that picture but could be related to star or "luck" (anything). 

4) What if all the 8-keys related to the process the data undergo in AR network?
DATA -> sign\hash -> hash\mine -> sent (broadcasted) -> scan (mapping?) -> ... (list? node?) -> pool (mempool?) or pull -> base or code (encode).....

5) Back to the idea of mining. Here what i've found in Discord:
```
curl  http://127.0.0.1:1984/peers
```

```
Try running just:  curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/master/install.sh | bash && cd arweave
```

```
From github:
Ubuntu/Debian Linux Quickstart

You can download the Arweave codebase, all dependencies and start mining straight away by
opening a terminal and running:

curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/master/install.sh | bash && cd arweave && ./arweave-server mine peer xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx peer yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy

Donâ€™t forget to change xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy, etc to the IP addresses you want to peer with.
```

```
You can ask any node in the network and they'll reply with all matching txs they know about,
curl -X POST \
  https://arweave.net/arql \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -d '{
    "op": "equals",
    "expr1": "App-Name",
    "expr2": "querweave"
}'
```

So, i guess, the puzzle could be somehow related to the mine process - commands that user should run.

For example, ***CURL*** could sound similar to CURVE or CURve Line and be the answer to pic 1. ***BASH*** files extensions are .SH and so it actually could be the asnwer to pic 2 - pic 2 shows the zip code of Snow Hill (SH). The ***MINE*** is what the pic 3 is about. Maybe the 4th pic is COIN or CASH (like AR.CASH or AR coin) etc. This idea could and should be speculated more. Tree have 32 leafs ( 9 leafs, 7 leafs, 8 leafs, 8 leafs) - that is approximately the number of coins emitted by miner on each block in 01-2019 - 06-2019 so pic 6 could be 32AR or some else reward synonimous. The 7th pic is about pool (mining pool or reward pool or storage pool - there are options...).

First, the bruteforce of the inputs is slown down by 11512 SHA512 + AES decryption. On a typical CPU you could expect around 0.5 sec for one thread (or CPU core) to compute this decrypting in browser (javascript that is in the original page) 

The Second problem - javascript library CryptoJS used here for computing AES decrypting: seems like it has a bug\feature that makes its results unique for some cases. Thus, using 512-bit key the CryptoJS AES gives the result that the typical AES library - not [[13]](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js/issues/293) and so to build some efficient brute force instrument, the coder will need at least to adjust the AES library he use to follow CryptoJS ruined logic. At least, that is how i see it now.

In general, the list of answers to try on this puzzle could be all possible combinations of all allowed symbols that will result in a huge list (assume all numbers {0-9}, letters{a-z}, special chars {,.\|+=...} ~ 50 different symbols or so) == `50^32 ~ 10^54` but that unreal to be brutted even if some efficient code will brute this task on all bitcoin ASICS on the plannet with their typical hashing speed.

Usually, the solver who wants to try to apply brute force here will compose a dictionary of possible "keys" - inputs. All "keys" or inputs mentioned in this README and probably all 4-letter words and abbreviations or terms mentioned on Arweave materials (including twitter, telegram, discord, promo materials, ..., Britain enyclopedia, whatever) - see extramaterials attached in this git. Typically, such a dictionary will be still huge for bruteforce on reasonable resource with the code we have - some of a core telegram members stated to try trillions of combinations on their PCs using some effective code (cant confirm the code efficience and\or correctness). And so, words for brute should be filtered. 

The ideal bruteforce program, i guess, will consist of two parts: the first will compose a list of inputs and - precompute the 11512 SHA512 hashing of the inputs; the second will compute AES with the resulted 512 bit keys and compare the result with "kty":"RSA" substring. The work could be done in chunks: portion of the dictionary transformed into 512-key and transfered for AES evaluation - to resolve problem of memory and probably to paralelize the work in a more efficient manner. SHA512 is easy part while AES is a problem due to mentioned "bug\feature" of CryptoJS lib.

I have composed a simple JavaScript code to do a bruteforce just in browser - thus i could avoid of re-coding CryptoJS features and yet this solution is a snail (very slow - 0.5 sec per core on 1 input). Later i have speed up this approach precomputing sha512 key on the c-program (CPU) and it increased the speed but yet not enough to call this a WIN. JavaScript just killing all mood here. 

***UPDATE*** Check the [BRUTE section](https://github.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/tree/main/PZL3/BRUTE), i have added more efficient JavaScript+Python brutter. It goes with around 5-6 combos per second on 1 thread and manage the history of brutted combinations. On my 8 thread CPU i have more than 40 combos per sec with this approach.

***UPDATE !!!*** Check the [BRUTE section](https://github.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/tree/main/PZL3/BRUTE), i have added more efficient GO+Python brutter. It goes with around 40-60 combos per second on 1 thread and manage the history of brutted combinations. On my 8 thread CPU i have more than 450 combos per sec with this approach.



`TO BE WRITTEN VERY SOON (day or two i will fill this section)`


## P.S.

Thank you for spending time on my notes, i hope it was not totally useless and you've found something interesting. 

Any ideas\questions or propositions you may send to generalizatorSUB@gmail.com - also look at my twitter @MiningPredict.

I have read all Tiamat posts in discord. ENGLISH is not my native, i am tired af, its so boring\sleepy to read all those. I mean, it would be "hard" to read in Russian\Ukraine but in english magnified x2,x3. Now i have mostly the same ideas as before actually. Constructing new "brute" list. Will re-read all posts for those 6 months Tiamat talking about. Have already viewed all twitter posts\youtube videos\articles for that period of time. Discord and telegram on the way cause previously i have not viewed those.
