# Arweave Puzzle #10 - "...execture the order 66..."

Here i am going to publish ideas i consider about and dummy instruments related to Arweave puzzle #10.

This puzzle is one from the series of Arweave Puzzles made by @Tiamat (official Arweave project discord member, apps developer, miner, early investor). Originally, puzzle posted in official @Tiamat twitter [[1]](
https://twitter.com/ArweaveP/status/1250025710133092353): with hints and link to the blockchain [[2]](https://2xzm6mh75smp5ivf2img3biam3iu7qhodsw5mk7cimkx7g4trl4a.arweave.net/1fLPMP_smP6ipdIYbYUAZtFPwO4crdYr4kMVf5uTivg)

Puzzle consists of the HTML page (sources also attached in this git - but could be found on Arweave "blockchain") page with an AES encrypted message (the Arweave wallet with **500 AR** coins on it, that is around of **3.5 k$** right now). The decryption mechanism is already built in page so the solver should only type the correct symbols to the long placeholder as show on picture below. The key to the puzzle solving is an image of some shread picture that likely to show separated pictures\objects:

# The official hints given by the puzzle creator are listed below:

    
```
    From Twitter:
    
    *] 1,2,4,8 = solved
       3,5,7,9 = not solved yet
       it seems like odds are harder?

```    

Some ideas came to my mind, others were captured from Twitter or\and the telegram group [[3]](@arweavep) - you definitely should visit it for ideas sharing.
(at first few months i have forcefully avoided visiting any forums or groups when i saw the puzzle at first because i thought that ideas of others could freeze my own thinking process - it is when you start to think primarly in the way proposed by some other solver and, got stuck on it, but later trying my own ideas with my own dummy brute forcing method i skipped that rule. I am actively posting any ideas came to my mind in that group, hoping someone of us will be able to solve the puzzle sharing some part of revenue and GLORY)

There are pretty "classic" ideas of what each image could code, but also there apretty exotic ideas. The last will be discussed at the end of this paper. Lets consider each picture "objects" one by one at first:

## 1-st key

![AR puzzle #10 key #1](https://github.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/blob/42008e05471a8821fdf8d1277455f597c14ab6f5/PZL10/pics/pzl10_key_1.jpg)

It is a stock image of ***dice*** [[4]](https://www.nicepng.com/ourpic/u2e6r5w7w7a9q8a9_open-dice-svg/) with ***"win" numbers "1" and "4"*** AND ***all shown numbers here are: "2,1,4" and "2,4"***.

## 2-nd key

![AR puzzle #10 key #2](https://github.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/blob/42008e05471a8821fdf8d1277455f597c14ab6f5/PZL10/pics/pzl10_key_2.jpg)

It is an image of  three numbers: ***6, 3, 18***. They could mean the ***Arweave ICO date***: 2018\06\03 that could be interpreted as Arweave ICO date. Known facts about that [[5]](https://icodrops.com/arweave/):

```
...
Important: 1.1% of genesis block supply (55 mln tokens) is available in the public sale,
for which there is a hardcap of $400k USD.
...
 TOKEN SALE: 3 JUN – 6 JUN (2018)
Ticker: AR Token 
type: ERC20 
ICO Token Price: 1 AR = 0.73 USD
Fundraising Goal: ETH
Total Tokens: 66,000,000

```

## 3-rd key

![AR puzzle #10 key #3](https://github.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/blob/42008e05471a8821fdf8d1277455f597c14ab6f5/PZL10/pics/pzl10_key_3.jpg)

Most hunters sees here the Palpatine (Darth Sidious) [[6']](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Sidious) face and letter a (***arweave reference***) upon it. Here is the Wiki picture of ***(Darth Sidious) Palpatine*** (from cosplay photo) that is likely being used here (may be some else is used - just an example):

![AR puzzle #10 key #3 Palpatine?](https://github.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/blob/2735324397077aa9444a4ba19f524deeda83c6e9/PZL10/pics/PZL_10_Palpatine.jpg)

Some remind here the Palpatine (Darth Sidious) quote: "The time has come. Execture ***order 66***..." [[6]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNjWpZmxDgg). Same time, the number 66 could be related to Arweave - the max coins(native token - AR) supply of arweave is ***66 000 000***.

## 4-th key

![AR puzzle #10 key #4](https://github.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/blob/42008e05471a8821fdf8d1277455f597c14ab6f5/PZL10/pics/pzl10_key_4.jpg)

It simply contain the string "[0-19]". 
One may assume here several ideas, it either code one integer from 0 to 19 interval, it slice the asnwers to the
previous keys to only 20 characters (all chras with indexes from 0 to 19 from the formed on previous step string)
or specify that it should be 20 char length, it should be simply 20 integer numbers 0,1,2,3,....,19 ("0123.....19") 

## 5-th key

![AR puzzle #10 key #1](https://github.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/blob/42008e05471a8821fdf8d1277455f597c14ab6f5/PZL10/pics/pzl10_key_5.jpg)

The "fifth key" is special - it is separated from the main picture and so oculd be assumed not as a key to the solution BUT hint (meaning its not about adding extra characters to the answer in extra to the previous keys but rather describe the whole solution along with previous keys).

It contains the corrupted (unfinished) string: "...nesis #28", AND a key attached to this string with help of clip. There are some hieroglyphs on the key. Some one describe them as "Earth" (try google translator - it will result in Chinese as "地 球"). Symbols on the key could actually be important or simply be part of the stock key used here (it could be a brand Earth or Globe or similar). (Also possible valuable fact - the hole on the paper where clip attached forming ***MAPLE LEAF*** picture)

The "...nesis #28" could be referece the Genesis block of Arweave, where the first investors have put short messages. I have composed a simple python script to get all messages in one file to analize them (could be found in "genesis_block" folder here in github). The 30 messages (transactions data) shown below (others could be founbd in the same folder "genesis_block"):
```
1] Karthik's Birthday
2] order is nothing more than a characteristic of the human inability to accept chaos.
3] hebikvandaagalgezegthoeveelikvanjehou. RR-MK-K-E en Roetie
4] RG08

28] We'll see what happens
29] To my sons future
30] This is very exciting and I wholeheartedly support this project :)

```
***We'll see what happens*** - this phrase is the #28 transaction data in the Arweave genesis block (or "To my sons future" if index the first message with 0)

Some people could remind here the Trump with this quote [[7]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mTv8unqFbQ)

***Strange thing that seems to be true is that transactions in arveaweve explorer listed in reversed to the index order. At least the genesis block transactions are listed reversed to the presented by the same explorer tx index order (see screenshot below). And so, the tx #28 from the block 0 (genesis block) could be not the "We'll see what happens", but "test".***

Still unsure about that... "We'll see what happens" looks better option for the puzzle than test....

# Brute-Force - "that's impossible (?!)" [8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ixvpLCdqkA)
![Its necessary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL3/pics/Cooper_necessary.gif)
![brute it TARS!!!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL3/pics/interstellar-cooper.gif)

Tiamat (the puzzle creator) has defended the puzzle from blind bruteforce. The wallet JSON string (that contains the private key) AES-encrypted by 512 bit pass-key. The 512 bit pass-key is a result of 11512 sequential SHA512 evaluations of the "keys" typed by the user - better look page sources or code snippet below.

```
....
function decodewallet(t,e)
{
    for(var i = CryptoJS.SHA512(e), n = 0; n < 11512; n++)
        i = CryptoJS.SHA512(i);
		
    CryptoJS.algo.AES.keySize = 32,CryptoJS.algo.EvpKDF.cfg.iterations=1e4,CryptoJS.algo.EvpKDF.cfg.keySize=32;
    var r = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(t,i.toString());
    
	return out = hex2a(r),out
}
....

var msg="U2FsdGVkX18Q23DTuKvD6i+mZJD....<LOTS OF SYMBOLS - SEE THE SOURCES>"

function proceed() 
{
    var code = document.getElementById('code').value;
    a = decodewallet(msg,code);
    if (a.search('"kty":"RSA"')>-1) 
    {
        document.getElementById('dstatus').innerHTML="SUCCESS";
        download("arweave_keyfile_bkjJGw3NLxs8OAyRxgTL-QFpiB3lBJqZ76kDhWdB-Rs.json",a);
    }
    else 
        document.getElementById('dstatus').innerHTML ="FAILED";
}

```
First, the bruteforce of the inputs is slown down by 11512 SHA512 + AES decryption. On a typical CPU you could expect around 0.5 sec for one thread (or CPU core) to compute this decrypting in browser (javascript that is in the original page) 

The Second problem - javascript library CryptoJS used here for computing AES decrypting: seems like it has a bug\feature that makes its results unique for some cases. Thus, using 512-bit key the CryptoJS AES gives the result that the typical AES library - not [[9]](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js/issues/293) and so to build some efficient brute force instrument, the coder will need at least to adjust the AES library he use to follow CryptoJS ruined logic. At least, that is how i see it now.

In general, the list of answers to try on this puzzle could be all possible combinations of all allowed symbols that will result in a huge list (assume all numbers {0-9}, letters{a-z}, special chars {,.\|+=...} ~ 50 different symbols or so) == `50^32 ~ 10^54` but that unreal to be brutted even if some efficient code will brute this task on all bitcoin ASICS on the plannet with their typical hashing speed.

Usually, the solver who wants to try to apply brute force here will compose a dictionary of possible "keys" - inputs. All "keys" or inputs mentioned in this README and probably all 4-letter words and abbreviations or terms mentioned on Arweave materials (including twitter, telegram, discord, promo materials, ..., Britain enyclopedia, whatever) - see extramaterials attached in this git. Typically, such a dictionary will be still huge for bruteforce on reasonable resource with the code we have - some of a core telegram members stated to try trillions of combinations on their PCs using some effective code (cant confirm the code efficience and\or correctness). And so, words for brute should be filtered. 

The ideal bruteforce program, i guess, will consist of two parts: the first will compose a list of inputs and - precompute the 11512 SHA512 hashing of the inputs; the second will compute AES with the resulted 512 bit keys and compare the result with "kty":"RSA" substring. The work could be done in chunks: portion of the dictionary transformed into 512-key and transfered for AES evaluation - to resolve problem of memory and probably to paralelize the work in a more efficient manner. SHA512 is easy part while AES is a problem due to mentioned "bug\feature" of CryptoJS lib.

I have composed a simple JavaScript code to do a bruteforce just in browser - thus i could avoid of re-coding CryptoJS features and yet this solution is a snail (very slow - 0.5 sec per core on 1 input). Later i have speed up this approach precomputing sha512 key on the c-program (CPU) and it increased the speed but yet not enough to call this a WIN. JavaScript just killing all mood here. 

Anyway, with my JS approach i bruted a million inputs per day - and no success.
