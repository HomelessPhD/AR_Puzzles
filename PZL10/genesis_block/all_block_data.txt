The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed

	The bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress

	From perfect grief there need not be

	Wisdom or even memory:

	One thing then learnt remains to me,-

	The woodspurge has a cup of three.

	Ad maiora. Ad infinitum.
For a future where our kids will remember you forever.

MONEY'S WORTH
,

	When your God comes a calling

	and you face up to him.

	Will you then confess

	to man's greatest sin?

	The confession of mankind

	to God you now must tell,

	Lets hope that he's forgiving

	for we may all burn in hell.

	

	Bless me lord for I have sinned

	I lost the meaning of life,

	and everywhere I travelled

	I held a bloody knife.

	Who's is the knife? Who's is the blood? Don't know but they're not mine,

	you have not got the bottle

	but you paid and that's your crime.

	

	The beauty of the silverback

	with its great big ashtray hands. 

	Crush a rhino's horn

	for medicine in far off lands.

	The biggest of all the cats

	you've a tiger for a rug,

	and for it's ivory tusks

	king elephant you will mug. 

	

	They're only bloody animals! Who cares about the beasts?

	When they're all dead and gone

	we'll move on to bigger feasts.

	Take all the goodness from his land

	and yes you will endeavour.

	To keep a fellow man enslaved

	and diamonds are forever.

	

	Man's mean machine keeps rolling

	now which land will it spoil?

	He's got to feed his industry

	his land it has no oil.

	So he sets a brother against his brother

	they say that's what they need.

	The starving winners promised food

	whilst oil feeds corporate greed.

	

	When a human being is born

	it's vulnerable and nude.

	Just like any other animal

	It only thinks of food,

	but as a human grows

	and this I don't find funny,

	it's taught to worship

	honour

	love and kill for money.

	Live progressive

	stay minimal. Afm

	Luck and love to all! 

	be good

	do good

Lord

	make me an instrument of Thy peace;

	where there is hatred

	let me show love;

	where there is injury

	pardon;

	where there is doubt

	faith;

	where there is despair

	hope;

	where there is darkness

	light;

	and where there is sadness

	joy.

	O Divine Master,

	grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console;

	to be understood

	as to understand;

	to be loved

	as to love;

	for it is in giving that we receive,

	it is in pardoning that we are pardoned,

	and it is in dying that we are born to Eternal Life.
