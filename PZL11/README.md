# Arweave Puzzle #11 - "#Stegonagraphy ...format does not matter..."

Here i am going to publish ideas i consider about and dummy instruments related to Arweave puzzle #11.

This puzzle is one from the series of Arweave Puzzles made by @Tiamat (official Arweave project discord member, apps developer, miner, early investor). Originally, puzzle posted in official @Tiamat twitter [[1]](https://twitter.com/arweavep/status/1252961944807641090): with hints and link to the blockchain [[2]](https://bmzbghtrbcleimhve3nf7f7owqwmllfjgwu67toc6wtsagmp3h3a.arweave.net/CzITHnEIlkQw9SbaX5futCzFrKk1qe_NwvWnIBmP2fY)

***Meanwhile, THE ORIGINAL Tiamat TWEET was DELETED***, but comments (including his own comments as well as mine) are still there.

Puzzle consists of the single PNG file (picture) (sources also attached in this git - but could be found on Arweave "blockchain"). In contrast to most AR puzzles, this one has no encrypted message and so there is no page with decryption code. The author stated that Private Key (to the 1 ETH wallet [[3]](https://etherscan.io/address/0xFF2142E98E09b5344994F9bEB9C56C95506B9F17) somehow "hidden" in this image and the way to claim the prize is to extract the private key from it.

# The official hints given by the puzzle creator are listed below:

    
```
    From Twitter:
    
    1] "0xFF2142E98E09b5344994F9bEB9C56C95506B9F17 it is also included somewhere in the image üßê"

    2] One guy asked: "What's the photo format. It'smnot JPG !?"
       And Tiamat answered: "format does not matter"

    3] Someone asked for more hints: "Can we get another hint?"
       But Tiamat replied: "Next set of hints when AR reaches $100 :)"

```    

Some ideas came to my mind, others were captured from Twitter or\and the telegram group [[4]](@arweavep) - you definitely should visit it for ideas sharing.
(at first few months i have forcefully avoided visiting any forums or groups when i saw the puzzle at first because i thought that ideas of others could freeze my own thinking process - it is when you start to think primarly in the way proposed by some other solver and, got stuck on it, but later trying my own ideas with my own dummy brute forcing method i skipped that rule. I am actively posting any ideas came to my mind in that group, hoping someone of us will be able to solve the puzzle sharing some part of revenue and GLORY)
