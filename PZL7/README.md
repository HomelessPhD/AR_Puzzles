# Arweave Puzzle #7 - "...Puzzle #7 with 3 ETH reward is live!..."

Here i am going to publish ideas i consider about and dummy instruments related to Arweave puzzle #7.

This puzzle is one from the series of Arweave Puzzles made by @Tiamat (official Arweave project discord member, apps developer, miner, early investor). Originally, puzzle posted in official @Tiamat twitter [[1]](
https://twitter.com/arweavep/status/1139528547612209152): with hints and link to the blockchain [[2]](https://eplpvctnryuimypdq6gbfk4rx3bbfepzoxz5pldkqdjczy5udpla.arweave.net/I9b6im2OKIZh44eMEquRvsISkfl189esaoDSLOO0G9Y
)

Puzzle consists of the HTML page (sources also attached in this git - but could be found on Arweave "blockchain") page with an AES encrypted message (the private key to the Ethereum wallet with **3 ETH** coins on it, that is around of **6 k$** right now). The decryption mechanism is already built in page so the solver should only type the correct symbols to the placeholder as show on picture below. The key to the puzzle solving is an 8 separated pictures\objects:

# The official hints given by the puzzle creator  in twitter and in AR blockchain [[3]](https://tye7crjtfnvaikwshreyhiutlmqtpzk2h5xsggyg7ujnwr57mikq.arweave.net/ngnxRTMragQq0jxJg6KTWyE35Vo_byMbBv0S20e_YhU) are listed below:

    
```
    From Twitter:
    
1] Hint: perimeter üßê

2] It's a series of words and numbers, the total length is 57 characters and there is no spacing required.

3] case sensitive, no special chars in #7 good luck!

4] Yes, I will release a clue soon if it does not get solved.

5] üí°"manner" is a tricky anagram, look very carefully on the visual context and also on the overall
     environment of the puzzle!

6] The hint for the cat is "literature"! üìö

7] Somewhere, valuable clues have been dropped ü§ê

8] No time limit, you submit in the form on the middle of the page. Good luck! üèÜ

9] The list of unsolved #Arweave puzzles ordered by difficulty probably looks like: 3, 9, 8, 5 ,7
```    

```
    Message FROM TIAMAT (the puzzle creator) in AR blockchain:

10] These have been circulating among some group of solvers, of course they are not the straight
    answers, but they will lead you there:
    Seasons, Life of Pi, Behemoth.
    
```

```
    From Discord:

11] When you reach a question/part and you have more answers for it, most likely none of them
is the right one üôÇ

12] Some guy asked: "Tiamat any chance of giving another hint about the "manner" in puzzle 7?".
    Tiamat answered: "consider both visual and technical context".


```

* There are some extra hints coded in page - some picture\objects shows the small textual hint when the mouse cursor points them at (shown in details below).


Some ideas came to my mind, others were captured from Twitter or\and the telegram group [[4]](@arweavep) - you definitely should visit it for ideas sharing.
(at first few months i have forcefully avoided visiting any forums or groups when i saw the puzzle at first because i thought that ideas of others could freeze my own thinking process - it is when you start to think primarly in the way proposed by some other solver and, got stuck on it, but later trying my own ideas with my own dummy brute forcing method i skipped that rule. I am actively posting any ideas came to my mind in that group, hoping someone of us will be able to solve the puzzle sharing some part of revenue and GLORY)

There are pretty "classic" ideas of what each image could code, but also there apretty exotic ideas. The last will be discussed at the end of this paper. Lets consider each picture one by one at first:

## 1-st key
![1-st key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL7/pics/1.png )

The first object (key) is an image of a tree with four types of leaves: winter type (no leaves), springt type (flower or young leaves), summer type (green leaves), autumn type (yellow leaves). The hint ecnoded in page (as shown here) contains two symbols: "V*". That could mean that the answer to this part of the puzzle is some series of symbols that starts with "V". The first thing that came here to mind is `"four seasons"` - the `group of four violin concertos by Italian composer Antonio Vivaldi, each of which gives musical expression to a season of the year` [[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Four_Seasons_(Vivaldi)). The hint maid by @Tiamat (puzzle developer) in his message on AR blockchain kind of supports this way of thinking. So, the probable answer here is `"Vivaldi"` itself, right?

Some also have noticed another option here - Vertumnus (Latin pronunciation: [w…õr't ämn äs]; also Vortumnus or Vertimnus) is the god of seasons, change and plant growth, as well as gardens and fruit trees. Starts with "V", related to seasons and plants. 

Finally, i consider the next keys: `"Vivaldi"`, `"vivaldi"`, `"AntonioLucioVivaldi"`, `"AntonioVivaldi"`, `"Antonio"`, `"music"`, `"violin"`, `"Valid"`, `"valid"`, `"Vertumnus"`,`"Vortumnus"`,`"Vertimnus"`, `....`

## 2-nd key
![2-nd key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL7/pics/2.png )

This a bit tough and not so straight. There are 3 symbols on this picture: `Pi` (looks very similar to Greek letter pi), `tail\fin` (looks like a fin or half of a tail of some fish), 'wave' (looks like a wave or sea surface).

Some try to compose here a word like in child riddles: `"Pi"`+ `"ta"` (half of a "tail" = "ta"+"il") + "C" (like sea by sound), resulting in some "Pitac", but i have not recovered anything reasonable this way.

Other noticing here the key objects form the `"Life of Pi"` novel\film [[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Pi_(film)): "...The storyline revolves around two survivors of a shipwreck who are on a lifeboat stranded `in the Pacific Ocean` for 227 days. One is a sixteen-year-old Indian boy named `Pi` Patel (Suraj Sharma) and the other is a ferocious Bengal tiger named Richard Parker... One night, a humpback `whale` destroys the raft and its supplies....". And the hint given by @Tiamat in his AR blockchain message seems like support this way of thinking. It somehow related to "Life of Pi". Another thing here to think about: we have no html-encoded hint here but there are 3 sub-parts in this image and probably `3` could be considered here is a hint (jsut a crazy idea to think about) - it could be 3 words for example (Life + of + Pi). So, i'd consider here some life of Pi related words or names. For example, the name of the author (Yann Martel) or real name of the tiger "Thirsty" (he was accidentally named as Richard Parker).

Finally, i'd consider the next keys here: `"LifeOfPi"`, `"lifeofpi"`, `"227"`,`"Pi"`,`"pi"`, `"PiscineMolitorPatel"`, `"PiscinePatel"`, `"Piscine"`, `"RichardParker"`, `"richardparker"`,`"SurajSharma"`,`"surajsharma"`, `"YannMartel"`, `"yannmartel"`, `"Martel"`, `"martel"`, `"Yann"`, `"yann"`, `"Thirsty"`, `"thirsty"`, `"film"`, `"book"`, `"story"`, `...`


## 3-rd key
![3-rd key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL7/pics/3.png )

The image of a plastic bottle with a label "manner". The HTML encoded hint is "{9}" that most likely should be treated as a size of the answer - 9 letters. Some guessed it could be a synonym to label AND manner at the same time: `"etiquette"` - this word relates to manners and in some languages the label on the bottle (and other production) called as "etiquette". Seems like a nice option. But after reading a @Tiamat hint given in twitter: "üí°"manner" is a tricky anagram, look very carefully on the visual context and also on the overall environment of the puzzle!", i realized that there is a perfect word that fits this situation. It is 9-letters word: "permanent". The bottle itself represented here as PET [[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate) and adding here manner treating it as anagram the only word of 9 letter you could assemble would be "permanent". Beside, the word combination permanent manner frequently occur in Arweave documentation.

(Another idea came to my mind was the name of PET bottles inventor - `"Nathaniel"` [[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Wyeth_(inventor)))

Finally, i'd consider the next keys here: `"Permanent"`, `"permanent"`, `"Etiquette"`, `"etiquette"`, `"etiquette"`, `"Nathaniel"`, `"nathaniel"`, `...`

## 4-th key
![4-th key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL7/pics/4.png )

This was found to be an anagram for "The domain of Edgar Allan Poe" and yet the HTML-encoded hint shows "7". 
In general, one could notice that the DOMAIN of Edgar Allan Poe is literature. If be more specific - "FICTION", "MYSTERY", "MADNESS", "MACABRE".

There is also a short story composed by Edgar Allan Poe named "THE DOMAIN OF ARNHEIM" [[9]](https://www.bauerverlag.eu/downloads/domain_.pdf). `"Arnheim"` is a 7 letter word that fits the requested length and the anagram context. Another word that can be used too could be the names from this story. For example, `"Ellison"`.

Finally, i'd consider the next keys here: `"Arnheim"`, `"arnheim"`, `"Ellison"`, `"ellison"`, `"Fiction"`, `"fiction"`, `"Mystery"`,`"mystery"`, `"Madness"`,`"madness"`, `"Macabre"`, `"macabre"`, `...`

## 5-th key
![5-th key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL7/pics/5.png )

This is an image of a black cat and a flower of daisies that in Russian is also called "margarita". The flower has a face on it hinting us that its "alive". The HTML-encoded hint says "{8}". Some familiar with Russian literature see here a link to Bulgakovs' book "Master and Margarita" [[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_and_Margarita). Beside of Margarita, there is a cat `Behemoth`: "...An enormous demonic black cat (said to be as big as a hog) who speaks, walks on two legs, and can transform into human shape for brief periods of time. He has a penchant for chess, vodka, pistols, and obnoxious sarcasm. He is evidently the least-respected member of Woland's team ‚Äì Margarita boldly takes to slapping Behemoth on the head after one of his many ill-timed jokes, without fear of retaliation. In the last chapters, it appears that Behemoth is a demon pageboy, the best clown in the world. His name (–ë–µ–≥–µ–º–æ—Ç) refers to both the Biblical monster and the Russian word for hippopotamus...". The @Tiamat hints made on Twitter: `The hint for the cat is "literature"! üìö`, and one made on AR blockchain message: "These have been circulating among some group of solvers, of course they are not the straight answers, but they will lead you there: Seasons, Life of Pi, Behemoth." justifying this ideas and the way of thinking. The answer likely related to Bulgakovs' Master and Margarita.

Finally, i'd consider the next keys here: `"Behemoth"`, `"behemoth"`, `"Bulgakov"`, `"bulgakov"`, `"Azazello"`, `"azazello"`, `"Koroviev"`, `"koroviev"`,  `...`

## 6-th key
![6-th key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL7/pics/6.png )

That one is tough but easy. Most assume that answer is the fourth number in the series, but it also could be a name of the series as whole object or series of numbers just pointing to the correct answer. There is no HTML-encoded hints same as Twitter hints for this. I assume the answer more likely the 4-digit number, probably a year (most of controversial pictures\keys in this puzzle have some hints about their length\size, but not this one - i expect this caused by predictable from its nature length: 4 digits like previous 3 numbers).

Googling these numbers, one may find an interesting coincidence: all numbers treated as years will result in eclipses (solar or lunar or even both). Probably the fourth number is also a year of some special Lunar or Solar eclipse. [[11]](https://in-the-sky.org/eclipses.php) (for example: 1984 and 1958 are years of total solar eclipse, 2047 is a year of total lunar eclipse....).

Also, this series of years related to some special sub-series of "strong" Eclipses (with some special attribute or feature) with a specific name that is the right answer. Some tethrada.

One active telegram member proposed another "1984" relation for this key: "Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past." This is the quote from George Orwell's 1984 novel and so the answer could be "1984", "1958" ( "present" or "past") or even the name of the novel author.

Finally, i'd consider the next keys here: `"Solar"`, `"Lunar"`, `"solar"`, `"lunar"`, `"Solareclipse"`, `"SolarEclipse"`, `"solareclipse"`, `"Lunareclipse"`, `"LunarEclipse"`, `"lunareclipse"`, `"1157"`, `"eclipses"`, `"Eclipses"`,`"eclipse"`, `"Eclipse"`, ... `<some years from 1900 to 2100>`, `Orwell`,`GeorgeOrwell`, `...`

## 7-th key
![7-th key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL7/pics/7.png )

The first idea is to search the information about fruit found in 2014 and somehow filter their names or story correspond to visual context of this key (squirel) and HTML-coded hint that says: "{7}". Some fruit names are: ANABP01, Achacha, ...

But another idea seems more promising. Searching for crypto related facts related to 2014 one may find out that Vitaly "Vitalik" Buterin (with ETHereum) actually won World Technology Network Award in 2014 [[12]](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/11/19/ethereums-vitalik-buterin-wins-world-technology-network-award/). The squirel could be easily related to Vitalik itself and new fruit is.... ETHereum. Assuming the hint saying it should be 7 letter word, the answer could be: Buterin or Vitalik.

![Vitalik](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL7/pics/VB.jpg )

Another interesting idea is about NFTs - usually when some one trying to find the origin of NFTs he could stop by ["Quantum"](https://nftnow.com/art/quantum-the-first-piece-of-nft-art-ever-created/) as the first NFT minter. Quantum is also a 7 letter word and it was relevant in 2014 year. So its a nice option to be the solution here.

Finally, i'd consider the next keys here: `"Buterin"`, `"buterin"`,`"Vitalik"`,`"vitalik"`, `"Quantum"`,`"Network"`,`"network"`, `"ANABP01"`, `"anabp01"`, `"Achacha"`, `"achacha"`, `...`

## 8-th key
![7-th key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL7/pics/8.png )

Here, i assume, hint "perimeter üßê" should be applied. Some tried to find rules here for numbers - one of such is that all numbers are 11 multipliers. I have tried simply apply the "perimeter" hint here to actually find the perimeter of all rectangles including the general rectangle that contains all smaller ones. Assuming the number written in smaller rectangles denoting their perimeters, the system of equations for the big rectangle perimeter is simple as follow:

![7-th key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL7/pics/perimeter.png )

```
P = 2*(a1+a2+a3+b1+b2+b3)
(a1+b2)*2=154
(a2+b1)*2=99
(a2+b2)*2=110
(a2+b3)*2=132
(a3+b2)=187
```
[[WolframAlpha solving]](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Solve%5B%7B+%28a1%2Bb2%29*2%3D%3D154%2C+%28a2%2Bb1%29*2%3D%3D99%2C+%28a2%2Bb2%29*2%3D%3D110%2C+%28a2%2Bb3%29*2%3D%3D132%2C+%28a3%2Bb2%29*2%3D%3D187%2C+x%3D%3D2*%28a1%2Ba2%2Ba3%2Bb1%2Bb2%2Bb3%29%7D%2C+x%5D)

Where finally, the perimeter equals to P = 462. The same system may be used to find the perimeters of smaller unknown rectangles: `(a1+b1)*2 = 143`, `(a3+b1)*2=176`, `(a1+b3)*2=176`, `(a3+b3)*2 = 209 `. Interesting fact - all perimeters are 11 multipliers including the perimeter of big (outer) rectangle.

Finally, i'd consider the next keys here: `"462"`, `"11"`, `"143176176209"`,`"14399176154110187176132209"`, `...`

# Brute-Force - "that's impossible (?!)" [14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ixvpLCdqkA)
![Its necessary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL3/pics/Cooper_necessary.gif)
![brute it TARS!!!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL3/pics/interstellar-cooper.gif)

Tiamat (the puzzle creator) has defended the puzzle from blind bruteforce. The wallet JSON string (that contains the private key) AES-encrypted by 512 bit pass-key. The 512 bit pass-key is a result of 11512 sequential SHA512 evaluations of the "keys" typed by the user - better look page sources or code snippet below.

```
....
decodewallet(t,e)
{
    for(var i = CryptoJS.SHA512(e), n = 0; n < 11512; n++)
        i=CryptoJS.SHA512(i);

    CryptoJS.algo.AES.keySize = 32, CryptoJS.algo.EvpKDF.cfg.iterations = 1e4, CryptoJS.algo.EvpKDF.cfg.keySize = 32;
	
    var r = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(t,i.toString());
    return out = hex2a(r),out
}
....
var msg="U2FsdGVkX18Nzf6P....<LOTS OF SYMBOLS - SEE THE SOURCES>"

function proceed() 
{
	var code = document.getElementById('textfield2').value;
	
	a = decodewallet(msg,code);
	if (a.search('{"version":3,"id"')>-1) 
	{
		document.getElementById('dstatus').innerHTML="SUCCESS";
		download("13f968d3bb996f39838ade86109b8150ba890d7e.json",a);
	}
	else document.getElementById('dstatus').innerHTML="FAILED";
}

```
First, the bruteforce of the inputs is slown down by 11512 SHA512 + AES decryption. On a typical CPU you could expect around 0.5 sec for one thread (or CPU core) to compute this decrypting in browser (javascript that is in the original page) 

The Second problem - javascript library CryptoJS used here for computing AES decrypting: seems like it has a bug\feature that makes its results unique for some cases. Thus, using 512-bit key the CryptoJS AES gives the result that the typical AES library - not [[15]](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js/issues/293) and so to build some efficient brute force instrument, the coder will need at least to adjust the AES library he use to follow CryptoJS ruined logic. At least, that is how i see it now.

In general, the list of answers to try on this puzzle could be all possible combinations of all allowed symbols that will result in a huge list (assume all numbers {0-9}, letters{a-z}, special chars {,.\|+=...} ~ 50 different symbols or so) == `50^32 ~ 10^54` but that unreal to be brutted even if some efficient code will brute this task on all bitcoin ASICS on the plannet with their typical hashing speed.

Usually, the solver who wants to try to apply brute force here will compose a dictionary of possible "keys" - inputs. All "keys" or inputs mentioned in this README and probably all 4-letter words and abbreviations or terms mentioned on Arweave materials (including twitter, telegram, discord, promo materials, ..., Britain enyclopedia, whatever) - see extramaterials attached in this git. Typically, such a dictionary will be still huge for bruteforce on reasonable resource with the code we have - some of a core telegram members stated to try trillions of combinations on their PCs using some effective code (cant confirm the code efficience and\or correctness). And so, words for brute should be filtered. 

The ideal bruteforce program, i guess, will consist of two parts: the first will compose a list of inputs and - precompute the 11512 SHA512 hashing of the inputs; the second will compute AES with the resulted 512 bit keys and compare the result with '{"version":3,"id"' substring. The work could be done in chunks: portion of the dictionary transformed into 512-key and transfered for AES evaluation - to resolve problem of memory and probably to paralelize the work in a more efficient manner. SHA512 is easy part while AES is a problem due to mentioned "bug\feature" of CryptoJS lib.

I have composed a simple JavaScript code to do a bruteforce just in browser - thus i could avoid of re-coding CryptoJS features and yet this solution is a snail (very slow - 0.5 sec per core on 1 input). Later i have speed up this approach precomputing sha512 key on the c-program (CPU) and it increased the speed but yet not enough to call this a WIN. JavaScript just killing all mood here. 

Anyway, with my JS approach i bruted a million inputs per day - and no success.

`TO BE WRITTEN VERY SOON (day or two i will fill this section)`
