# Arweave Puzzle #12 - ... short IQ test or ARweave quiz...

Here i am going to publish ideas i consider about and dummy instruments related to Arweave puzzle #12.

This puzzle is one from the series of Arweave Puzzles made by @Tiamat (official Arweave project discord member, apps developer, miner, early investor). Originally, puzzle posted in official @Tiamat twitter [[1]](
https://twitter.com/arweavep/status/1257613928185675776): with hints and link to the blockchain [[2]](
https://qmu25gaaftcgs45i6l4r6oqea7c6xsxowwrv56epxpd4ghnvikfa.arweave.net/gymumAAsxGlzqPL5HzoEB8Xryu61o174j7vHwx21Qoo)

Puzzle consists of the HTML page (sources also attached in this git - but could be found on Arweave "blockchain") page with an AES encrypted message (the Arweave wallet with **400 AR** coins on it, that is around of **3.7 k$** right now). The decryption mechanism is already built in page so the solver should only type the correct symbols to the long placeholder as show on picture below. The keys to the puzzle solving are 4 "puzzle pieces" that are likely to show separated pictures\objects:

# Assembling the puzzle
The puzzle consists of 4 separated parts that, actually, could be assembled in several different combinations forming 1 concatinated answer OR all 4 parts could somehow point to unique answer (term, date, event etc.)

The general idea (that is based on previous solved Tiamat puzzles) that the answer forms from sub-answers to each 4 puzzle parts concatinating them with no spaces in between. ***but options are possible here***

***IMPORTANT THING TO TAKE IN MIND*** - pieces of this puzzles could be connect in different ways, so, going with that concatenation idea ***the solver should consider different permuations*** of puzzles 4 pieces.

# The official hints given by the puzzle creator are listed below:

    
```
    From Twitter:
    1] "58 chars CS" - meaning the length of the answer is 58 characters and type is case sensitive

    *] 1,2,4,8 = solved
       3,5,7,9 = not solved yet
       it seems like odds are harder?

```    

Some ideas came to my mind, others were captured from Twitter or\and the telegram group [[3]](@arweavep) - you definitely should visit it for ideas sharing.
(at first few months i have forcefully avoided visiting any forums or groups when i saw the puzzle at first because i thought that ideas of others could freeze my own thinking process - it is when you start to think primarily in the way proposed by some other solver and, got stuck on it, but later trying my own ideas with my own dummy brute forcing method i skipped that rule. I am actively posting any ideas came to my mind in that group, hoping someone of us will be able to solve the puzzle sharing some part of revenue and GLORY)

There are pretty "classic" ideas of what each image could code, but also there apretty exotic ideas. The last will be discussed at the end of this paper. Lets consider each picture "objects" one by one at first:

## 1-st key

![AR puzzle #12 key #1](https://github.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/blob/ca63438a7f33a366ccc9430b59c3cd7140609f74/PZL12/pics/pzl_12_key_1.png)

This looks just like a part of IQ test, right? Complete and follow the pattern - objects in the series have several "features" and each feature follows its series (in IQ tests). Following this idea, one may assume that question is about the color of the "last" 6th flag that is drawn white here, and that all flags have three or four features: endpoint (form of endpoints), flag location (bottom, mid, top), flag color, flag "direction" (left of right). 

You see - they seem like goes in pairs: 1 flag with ball + 1 flag without a ball and position\direction of flags are opposite everytime. Thats the key to this IQ test

![AR puzzle #12 key #1 IQ test](https://github.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/blob/8ff1ffe4d91be7b64554e1770a79c66a748017d5/PZL12/pics/pzl_12_key_IQ_test.png)

Should we guess the color of "white" flag should have in this series?

Here i written out the colors of flags:

```
Colors  (RGB)      
red:    c0 00 00  192 0   0
purple: 41 00 80   65 0 128

gray:   80 80 80  128 128 128 
green:  3f 80 00   63 128   0

purple: 7f 00 ff   127   0 255
white:  ff ff ff   255 255 255


Colors  (CMYK)      
red:    0%, 100%, 100%, 25%
purple: 49%, 100%, 0%, 50% 

gray:   0%,   0%,   0%, 50% 
green:  51%,  0%, 100%, 50%

purple: 50%, 100%, 0%, 0%
white:  0%     0%, 0%, 0%

```

And tried to identify the [names](https://colors.artyclick.com/color-name-finder/) of colors, but not sure about it:

```
red:    Guardsman Red / Milano Red / Rosso Corsa / Venetian Red / Scarlet
purple:  Kingfisher Daisy / Indigo / Royal Purple / Persian Indigo / Purple Monster

gray:   Granite / Medium Grey / Friar Grey / Battleship Grey / Hurricane
green:  Dark Grass Green / Napier Green / Medium Spring Green / Tree Green / Green Leaf

purple: ArtyClick Purple / Electric Indigo / Vivid Violet / Purplish Blue / Dark Violet
white:  White / Romance / Ceramic / Pale Grey / Milk White

```

Another idea, that all the flags code something - some number, some date or event, some name (person or organization), some term?

## 2-nd key

![AR puzzle #12 key #2](https://github.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/blob/ca63438a7f33a366ccc9430b59c3cd7140609f74/PZL12/pics/pzl_12_key_2.png)

The ***WHALE*** and the ***date: 16-03-2020***. The association that came to my mind when i see WHALE in context of ARweave is ***Andreessen Horowitz*** (or ***a16z***) cause he have supported ARweave investing much funds in it (probably the largest AR investor). And googling the date in cotext of ARweave investment\support even make this idea more likely to be the correct way of thinking [[4]](https://twitter.com/BTCDaMac/status/1302589688172158978) [[4']](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelhaley/2020/03/16/arweaves-permanent-library-of-alexandria-on-blockchain-to-halt-censorship-empower-information/) [[4'']](https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/arweave-seed--7ab9cadf) [[4''']](https://arweave.medium.com/arweave-news-march-7034ed9479e2).

[FORBES article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelhaley/2020/03/16/arweaves-permanent-library-of-alexandria-on-blockchain-to-halt-censorship-empower-information/), that connect the investment news and the date (the article published in 16-03-2020) is also attached in this github (key2_FORBS_article.html in "extra" section)

So, i assume the answer is somehow related OR point to - the Andreessen Horowitz (and maybe other involved investors: 
![AR puzzle #12 key #2](https://github.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/blob/5cacd5c6924748da94512c609d91832fb24d3c9c/PZL12/pics/funding_round_ARweave.png)

***Union Square Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, a16z crypto***

ALTERNATIVE theory (less likely to be true, but who knows??) - googling 16-03-2020 and WHALE could lead to the [SPERM WHALE AND ORCA DAY â€“ 16/3/20](https://whale-tales.org/sperm-whale-and-orca-day-16-3-20/)

## 3-rd key

![AR puzzle #12 key #3](https://github.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/blob/ca63438a7f33a366ccc9430b59c3cd7140609f74/PZL12/pics/pzl_12_key_3.png)

Square (101111), Rhombus or Diamond (2111112), Rectangle(111211021) and finally a Hexagon. The first thing one may assume here is we should define the series of digits for Hexagon guessing the pattern..

Well, there are few ideas about it. It could be about the names of figures - maybe the name coded through ASCII or alphabet etc. Maybe its about number of free-parameters of figure ( just 1 side for square, 1 side and 1 angle for romb, 2 sides for rectangle (maybe 2 sides and 1 angle if this is paralelogram) and hexagon with, i guess, 1 side and 2 angles. 

It could be even the series of parameters (their values) in the drawing tool where these shapes were drawn.

Seems like each digit in the digit series represent some letter in the figure (shape) name (the diamond fits better - thanks for notice)

```
S Q U A R E
1 0 1 1 1 1 

D I A M O N D
2 1 1 1 1 1 2

R E C T A N G L E
1 1 1 2 1 1 0 2 1

```

Thinking this way, the HEXAGON letters (and though the HEXAGON shape) could be represented by digits taken from known figures:

```
H E X A G O N
! 1 ? 1 0 1 1
```
Where ! and ? are unknown digits (Letters "H" and "X" have not been used in known shapes names). It is more likely they are 0,1 or 2.

Someone could assume here a simple bruteforce routine with all combinations of different digits for ! and ? placeholders (could be limited to 0,1,2,3 but
if resources allow - betteg take all 10 possible values for each digits: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)

```
0101011, 0111011, 0121011, ..., 9181011, 9191011
```

But someone have found out, that written on paper some letter would occupy "1 line" while other will use some space below and above as show on picture:
![AR puzzle #12 key #3](https://github.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/blob/21c19ace14d69a41b9ea8a1476a9dec34b15e2bd/PZL12/pics/hexagon_digits.png)

***So THE MOST LIKELY ANSWER HERE IS 2111011***

## 4-th key

![AR puzzle #12 key #4](https://github.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/blob/ca63438a7f33a366ccc9430b59c3cd7140609f74/PZL12/pics/pzl_12_key_4.png)

One may assume its just a 5 letter word like: ```Alien or Aline, Anile, Elain, Liane```. But other option here is to follow the same IQ tests idea and try to reshape the squares with letters. Each square with letter have 4 sections with different dashing.
What if we should cut the squeres and re-sample them into new 5 squres with else letters - like, maybe combining same dashing style in 1 squre or something like that??

It also could be the words from more than 5 letters: 6, 7...

Here is the list of possible 6 letter words composed having each known letter ("A", "L", "I", "E", "N"):
```alevin,alexin,aliens,alined,aliner,alines,alkine,alpine,alvine,ancile,denial,elains,entail,eolian,finale,genial,inhale,inlace,inwale,larine,larnie,lawine,lianes,lienal,linage,lineal,linear,maline,menial,nailed,nailer,penial,pineal,renail,saline,silane,tenail,tineal,valine,veinal,venial,vineal,xenial,venial,vineal,xenial```

# "Exotic" ideas

1] THE FORBES articles (or some else magazines?!). Just look at articles that has been found for key #2. And now open other articles of the same author in FORBES [[this]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelhaley/2020/01/30/digital-art-framed-and-collected-on-blockchain/), [[that]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelhaley/2020/03/16/arweaves-permanent-library-of-alexandria-on-blockchain-to-halt-censorship-empower-information/) and [[last]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelhaley/2020/02/26/tim-draper-backed-aragon-disrupts-traditional-governance-with-a-decentralized-court/). Maybe articles made by "Michael Stephen Haley" means something here. Just another crazy idea guys, but you should open your mind for such things time to time.

# Brute-Force - "that's impossible (?!)" [8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ixvpLCdqkA)
![Its necessary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL3/pics/Cooper_necessary.gif)
![brute it TARS!!!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL3/pics/interstellar-cooper.gif)

Tiamat (the puzzle creator) has defended the puzzle from blind bruteforce. The wallet JSON string (that contains the private key) AES-encrypted by 512 bit pass-key. The 512 bit pass-key is a result of 11512 sequential SHA512 evaluations of the "keys" typed by the user - better look page sources or code snippet below.

```
....
function decodewallet(t, e)
{
    for (var i = CryptoJS.SHA512(e), n = 0; n < 11512; n++)
        i = CryptoJS.SHA512(i);

    CryptoJS.algo.AES.keySize = 32,
    CryptoJS.algo.EvpKDF.cfg.iterations = 1e4,
    CryptoJS.algo.EvpKDF.cfg.keySize = 32;
    var r = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(t, i.toString());

    return out = hex2a(r), out
}
....

var msg="U2FsdGVkX185RdQ4hP1hJTBpuz6pKjHyS+aY6XLFW....<LOTS OF SYMBOLS - SEE THE SOURCES>"

function proceed()
{
    var code = document.getElementById('code').value;
    a = decodewallet(msg, code);
    if (a.search('"kty":"RSA"') > -1)
    {
        document.getElementById('dstatus').innerHTML = "SUCCESS";
        download("arweave_keyfile_XRGEfkMbCMHeTY9mZI9Lh6hf8EmA8RstmBFUjDm40fg.json", a);
    }
    else
        document.getElementById('dstatus').innerHTML = "FAILED";
}

```
First, the bruteforce of the inputs is slown down by 11512 SHA512 + AES decryption. On a typical CPU you could expect around 0.5 sec for one thread (or CPU core) to compute this decrypting in browser (javascript that is in the original page) 

The Second problem - javascript library CryptoJS used here for computing AES decrypting: seems like it has a bug\feature that makes its results unique for some cases. Thus, using 512-bit key the CryptoJS AES gives the result that the typical AES library - not [[9]](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js/issues/293) and so to build some efficient brute force instrument, the coder will need at least to adjust the AES library he use to follow CryptoJS ruined logic. At least, that is how i see it now.

In general, the list of answers to try on this puzzle could be all possible combinations of all allowed symbols that will result in a huge list (assume all numbers {0-9}, letters{a-z}, special chars {,.\|+=...} ~ 50 different symbols or so) == `50^32 ~ 10^54` but that unreal to be brutted even if some efficient code will brute this task on all bitcoin ASICS on the plannet with their typical hashing speed.

Usually, the solver who wants to try to apply brute force here will compose a dictionary of possible "keys" - inputs. All "keys" or inputs mentioned in this README and probably all 4-letter words and abbreviations or terms mentioned on Arweave materials (including twitter, telegram, discord, promo materials, ..., Britain enyclopedia, whatever) - see extramaterials attached in this git. Typically, such a dictionary will be still huge for bruteforce on reasonable resource with the code we have - some of a core telegram members stated to try trillions of combinations on their PCs using some effective code (cant confirm the code efficience and\or correctness). And so, words for brute should be filtered. 

The ideal bruteforce program, i guess, will consist of two parts: the first will compose a list of inputs and - precompute the 11512 SHA512 hashing of the inputs; the second will compute AES with the resulted 512 bit keys and compare the result with "kty":"RSA" substring. The work could be done in chunks: portion of the dictionary transformed into 512-key and transfered for AES evaluation - to resolve problem of memory and probably to paralelize the work in a more efficient manner. SHA512 is easy part while AES is a problem due to mentioned "bug\feature" of CryptoJS lib.

I have composed a simple JavaScript code to do a bruteforce just in browser - thus i could avoid of re-coding CryptoJS features and yet this solution is a snail (very slow - 0.5 sec per core on 1 input). Later i have speed up this approach precomputing sha512 key on the c-program (CPU) and it increased the speed but yet not enough to call this a WIN. JavaScript just killing all mood here. 

Anyway, with my JS approach i bruted a million inputs per day - and no success.

`TO BE WRITTEN VERY SOON (day or two i will fill this section)`
