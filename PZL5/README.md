# Arweave Puzzle #5 - "...The list of unsolved #Arweave puzzles ordered by difficulty probably looks like: 3, 9, 8, 5 ,7..."

Here i am going to publish ideas i consider about and dummy instruments related to Arweave puzzle #5.

This puzzle is one from the series of Arweave Puzzles made by @Tiamat (official Arweave project discord member, apps developer, miner, early investor). Originally, puzzle posted in official @Tiamat twitter [[1]](
https://twitter.com/arweavep/status/1135460147881529344): with hints and link to the blockchain [[2]](https://d5zw4kksq5gasg7ezkjvdpey562svcviatdltuyga43lrkexvngq.arweave.net/H3NuKVKHTAkb5MqTUbyY77UqiqgExrnTBgc2uKiXq00
)

Puzzle consists of the HTML page (sources also attached in this git - but could be found on Arweave "blockchain") page with an AES encrypted message (the Arweave wallet with **500 AR** coins on it, that is around of **5 k$** right now). The decryption mechanism is already built in page so the solver should only type the correct symbols to the 7 placeholders as show on picture below. The key to the puzzle solving is an image of "child-like scavenger hunt map" with 7 (or 8 depend on your interpretation) separated pictures\objects:

```
    From Twitter:
    
1] "x" on paper = what on computer?

2] Someone asked: "What word can be on 2 letters ?" And the puzzle creator answered: "It also can be a number."

3] For GoT fans, the tree should ring a bell ü§ê

Some ideas came to my mind, others were captured from Twitter or\and the telegram group [[3]](@arweavep) - you definitely should visit it for ideas sharing.
(at first few months i have forcefully avoided visiting any forums or groups when i saw the puzzle at first because i thought that ideas of others could freeze my own thinking process - it is when you start to think primarly in the way proposed by some other solver and, got stuck on it, but later trying my own ideas with my own dummy brute forcing method i skipped that rule. I am actively posting any ideas came to my mind in that group, hoping someone of us will be able to solve the puzzle sharing some part of revenue and GLORY)

There are pretty "classic" ideas of what each image could code, but also there apretty exotic ideas. The last will be discussed at the end of this paper. Lets consider each picture one by one at first:

## 1-st key
![1-st key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL5/pics/1.png )

It seemed to be an entry point of this Scavanger Hunt because it has an arrow that indicates the direction onto the dashed line. The input placeholder for this likely to be just one symbol length. The @Tiamat hinted this key directly: `"x" on paper = what on computer?"`. But its again too vague to understand. The first idea came to mind here is to interpret this "x" as multiplication and so on pc it could be: `"*"`, `"."`, `"x"`, but also it could mean the number 10 in Roman numerals and them it could be represented by hexadeciaml 10: `"a", "A"`. It also could be `"0"` or `"1"` or even space `" "`, if it means some kind of placeholder for your choice (so on PC it was empty but on paper some placed x in negative meaning).


Finally, i consider the next keys: `"a", "A", "x", "X", "*", ".", "0", "1", " ",....`

## 2-nd key
![2-nd key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL5/pics/2.png )
This images the mushroom and butterfly. Could be coded by first letters as `mb` or `MB` or `Mb` (yeah, like megabyte, hmm). Also could be coded by the length of words: `89`.

Finally, i'd consider the next keys here: `"mb", "Mb", "MB", "89", "sh", ...`


## 3-rd key
Here are the general idea about what picture representes key # 3 - the shining moon with a notes...
![3-rd key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL5/pics/3.png )

..., BUT, it is not on the dash line path. In contrast, the top of the tree is on the dashed line path
![optional 3-rd key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL5/pics/3_possible.png )

Considering the first option, most of us would guess the MoonLight sonata composed by Ludwig van Beethoven [[4]](https://musescore.com/classicman/scores/55352). 
![moonlight sonata](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL5/pics/moon_light_sonata.png )

Moonlight sonate could be encoded using 3 symbols as the following: `N14`,`#14`,`n14`,`o27`,`O27`,`c#m`,`C#M`,`LbB`,`LVB`,`lvb` and `GCE`,`gce` that could represents those first three piano-keys [[5]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNWMSo2y2L8)

Considering the second option, i could assume here `top` or `tip` or  (top of the tree - actually crown it is)

Finally, i'd consider the next keys here: `"N14"`,`"#14"`,`"n14"`,`"o27"`,`"O27"`,`"c#m"`,`"C#M"`,`"LbB"`,`"LVB"`,`"lvb"`,`"GCE"`,`"gce"`,`"top"`,`"tip"`,`...`

## 4-th key
![4-th key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL5/pics/4.png )

As a Ukrainian\Russian native speaker, the first thing i see here is cyrilic letter `–∂`. But more likely it is the Eris symbol [[6]](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Eris)
![Eris symbol](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL5/pics/Eris_symbol.png )

Finally, i'd consider the next keys here: `"Eris"`,`"eris"`,`"ERIS"`,`"Elli"`,`"elli"`,`...`

## 5-th key
![5-th key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL5/pics/5.png )

Finally, i'd consider the next keys here: ` ...`

## 6-th key
![6-th key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL5/pics/6.png )

Finally, i'd consider the next keys here: ` ...`

## 7-th key
![7-th key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL5/pics/7.png )

Finally, i'd consider the next keys here: `...`

# Brute-Force - "that's impossible (?!)" [12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ixvpLCdqkA)
![Its necessary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL3/pics/Cooper_necessary.gif)
![brute it TARS!!!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomelessPhD/AR_Puzzles/main/PZL3/pics/interstellar-cooper.gif)

Tiamat (the puzzle creator) has defended the puzzle from blind bruteforce. The wallet JSON string (that contains the private key) AES-encrypted by 512 bit pass-key. The 512 bit pass-key is a result of 11512 sequential SHA512 evaluations of the "keys" typed by the user - better look page sources or code snippet below.

```
....
function decodewallet(t,e)
{
    for(var i=CryptoJS.SHA512(e),n=0;n<11512;n++)
	    i=CryptoJS.SHA512(i);
		
	CryptoJS.algo.AES.keySize=32,CryptoJS.algo.EvpKDF.cfg.iterations=1e4,CryptoJS.algo.EvpKDF.cfg.keySize=32;
	var r = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(t,i.toString());
	
	return out=hex2a(r),out
}
....

var msg="U2FsdGVkX1+E2/9....<LOTS OF SYMBOLS - SEE THE SOURCES>"

function proceed() {
	var x = document.getElementsByClassName("inputs");
        var code="";
        for (var i=0;i<x.length;i++)
                code+=x[i].value;

	a=decodewallet(msg,code);
	if (a.search('"kty":"RSA"')>-1) {
		document.getElementById('dstatus').innerHTML="SUCCESS";
		download("arweave_keyfile_G2BaxD9phYHJ55VaEY-aX28FtQCKLORMMQSc74IaqYg.json",a);
	}
	else document.getElementById('dstatus').innerHTML="FAILED";
}

```
First, the bruteforce of the inputs is slown down by 11512 SHA512 + AES decryption. On a typical CPU you could expect around 0.5 sec for one thread (or CPU core) to compute this decrypting in browser (javascript that is in the original page) 

The Second problem - javascript library CryptoJS used here for computing AES decrypting: seems like it has a bug\feature that makes its results unique for some cases. Thus, using 512-bit key the CryptoJS AES gives the result that the typical AES library - not [[13]](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js/issues/293) and so to build some efficient brute force instrument, the coder will need at least to adjust the AES library he use to follow CryptoJS ruined logic. At least, that is how i see it now.

In general, the list of answers to try on this puzzle could be all possible combinations of all allowed symbols that will result in a huge list (assume all numbers {0-9}, letters{a-z}, special chars {,.\|+=...} ~ 50 different symbols or so) == `50^32 ~ 10^54` but that unreal to be brutted even if some efficient code will brute this task on all bitcoin ASICS on the plannet with their typical hashing speed.

Usually, the solver who wants to try to apply brute force here will compose a dictionary of possible "keys" - inputs. All "keys" or inputs mentioned in this README and probably all 4-letter words and abbreviations or terms mentioned on Arweave materials (including twitter, telegram, discord, promo materials, ..., Britain enyclopedia, whatever) - see extramaterials attached in this git. Typically, such a dictionary will be still huge for bruteforce on reasonable resource with the code we have - some of a core telegram members stated to try trillions of combinations on their PCs using some effective code (cant confirm the code efficience and\or correctness). And so, words for brute should be filtered. 

The ideal bruteforce program, i guess, will consist of two parts: the first will compose a list of inputs and - precompute the 11512 SHA512 hashing of the inputs; the second will compute AES with the resulted 512 bit keys and compare the result with "kty":"RSA" substring. The work could be done in chunks: portion of the dictionary transformed into 512-key and transfered for AES evaluation - to resolve problem of memory and probably to paralelize the work in a more efficient manner. SHA512 is easy part while AES is a problem due to mentioned "bug\feature" of CryptoJS lib.

I have composed a simple JavaScript code to do a bruteforce just in browser - thus i could avoid of re-coding CryptoJS features and yet this solution is a snail (very slow - 0.5 sec per core on 1 input). Later i have speed up this approach precomputing sha512 key on the c-program (CPU) and it increased the speed but yet not enough to call this a WIN. JavaScript just killing all mood here. 

Anyway, with my JS approach i bruted a million inputs per day - and no success.
